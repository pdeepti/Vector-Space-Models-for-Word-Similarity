26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " schröder said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " on wednesday , the plan found enthusiastic takers at a meeting in berlin between the chancellor and representatives from germany 's 16 states and local governments .
several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "
at the same time the chancellor stressed that aid , however important and effective , " could not afford to be just an emergency measure , but had to be sustainable and long-term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents walk past by debris in the town of meulaboh , aceh province , indonesia .
he added that the plan singled out sri lanka and indonesia because they had borne the brunt of the tidal waves .
schröder also welcomed the idea of sponsorship programs for people orphaned in the disaster . before the meeting , schröder 's government agreed on setting up a working group made up of several ministries and representatives of states and local communities .
the group would be answerable to the foreign ministry and would handpick projects as well as prepare concrete aid . foreign minister joschka fischer , who returned from the disaster-hit region on wednesday , urged countries to take long-term action and not simply pay lip service to the tragedy while it was making headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in phuket , thailand .
it was " important to make something positive out of this disaster in the future , " and that partnerships were a good way to do so , he said at a press conference in berlin . " the right idea " many believe that schröder 's suggestion has been enthusiastically welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , last week called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " the proposal also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women quench their thirst from distributed safe water packets in tamil nadu the idea has also sparked interest among german cities . the former capital of bonn plans - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - to set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said last week that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months . " i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone , the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris club freezes south asian debt the paris club of creditor nations announced wednesday an immediate , unconditional debt repayment freeze for indonesia , the seychelles and sri lanka , which were hit by last month 's catastrophic tidal wave .

because there 's no telling when the next flurries will come , many ski operators are relying on artificial snow from machines .
these machines are the life-line for europe ’ s winter sports resorts .
without them , the ski runs would remain bare and the tourists would not come .
half of the seasonal income would fall out , leaving many families desperate for employment .
even mountainous switzerland depends on the machines for a continual snow cover .
in st. moritz , 14 snow makers are constantly busy producing the soft powder .
at least half of the resort ’ s annual profits would melt without the machines .
but environmentalists warn of the dangers associated with relying too heavily on artificial snow makers .
" the original idea , to use snow machines sparingly and only in valleys , has been forgotten , " says gerald steindlegger of austria ’ s world wide fund for nature .
" today entire ski resorts are being covered in artificial snow .
this has negative consequences for the environment , and severe ones at that . "
more snow , but less water the most obvious consequence for the environment is the depleted supply of drinking water .
snow machines run on the basic principle of turning water into snow .
a motorized compressor pumps water into the machine and then propels it in droplets through the air .
while in flight , the droplets turn into flakes and fall as soft snow to the ground .
to cover one square meter of ski run , a snow machine requires 100 liters of quality water .
per season this adds up to 600 liters of water per square meter .
to meet the increased demand for water , ski operators draw from local rivers and mountain streams , further diminishing what the austrian wwf already regards as a limited supply .
mountain streams , a vital component in the alpine ecosystem , are often pumped dry during the ski season and only regain their volume for a few months in the summer after the snow melts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker shovels truckloads of imported snow to prepare for the ski jump world championships in titisee-neustadt in 2003 .
snow coverage ski run operators not only use the snow machines to cover slopes during unseasonably warm periods , but also to prolong the ski season beyond the normal winter months .
because artificial snow is also more compact and heavier than new snow it needs almost twice as long to melt .
the extended snow coverage alters the natural climate cycle of the alps .
although the temperatures are warmer , spring is not permitted to melt the snow away .
the growth of new vegetation is therefore hindered .
another consequence of the snow machines is noise pollution .
a high pressure compressor produces 115 decibels of noise .
the human ear can tolerate about 85 decibels before beginning to suffer damage .
studies conducted by the bavarian organization for environmental protection have shown that animals are seriously effected by the noise of the machines .
because the snow makers are turned on only at night animals ’ nocturnal behavior is also altered .
" winter tourism is an important economic factor in the alpine regions .
but the unchecked use of snow machines has long term effects that destroy the landscape , and will ultimately drive away the tourists , " says steindlegger .
in 2002 , the european union will present findings on a long-term study on the environmental sustainability of snow machines .
until then , ski resorts will continue to rely on the artificial snow to sustain their livelihood . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe heats up according to a new report by europe 's leading environment agency , the continent only has 50 years to adapt to changing weather conditions with three-quarters of europe 's glaciers expected to melt .

because there 's no telling when the next flurries will come , many ski operators are relying on artificial snow from machines .
these machines are the life-line for europe ’ s winter sports resorts .
without them , the ski runs would remain bare and the tourists would not come .
half of the seasonal income would fall out , leaving many families desperate for employment .
even mountainous switzerland depends on the machines for a continual snow cover .
in st. moritz , 14 snow makers are constantly busy producing the soft powder .
at least half of the resort ’ s annual profits would melt without the machines .
but environmentalists warn of the dangers associated with relying too heavily on artificial snow makers .
" the original idea , to use snow machines sparingly and only in valleys , has been forgotten , " says gerald steindlegger of austria ’ s world wide fund for nature .
" today entire ski resorts are being covered in artificial snow .
this has negative consequences for the environment , and severe ones at that . "
more snow , but less water the most obvious consequence for the environment is the depleted supply of drinking water .
snow machines run on the basic principle of turning water into snow .
a motorized compressor pumps water into the machine and then propels it in droplets through the air .
while in flight , the droplets turn into flakes and fall as soft snow to the ground .
to cover one square meter of ski run , a snow machine requires 100 liters of quality water .
per season this adds up to 600 liters of water per square meter .
to meet the increased demand for water , ski operators draw from local rivers and mountain streams , further diminishing what the austrian wwf already regards as a limited supply .
mountain streams , a vital component in the alpine ecosystem , are often pumped dry during the ski season and only regain their volume for a few months in the summer after the snow melts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker shovels truckloads of imported snow to prepare for the ski jump world championships in titisee-neustadt in 2003 .
snow coverage ski run operators not only use the snow machines to cover slopes during unseasonably warm periods , but also to prolong the ski season beyond the normal winter months .
because artificial snow is also more compact and heavier than new snow it needs almost twice as long to melt .
the extended snow coverage alters the natural climate cycle of the alps .
although the temperatures are warmer , spring is not permitted to melt the snow away .
the growth of new vegetation is therefore hindered .
another consequence of the snow machines is noise pollution .
a high pressure compressor produces 115 decibels of noise .
the human ear can tolerate about 85 decibels before beginning to suffer damage .
studies conducted by the bavarian organization for environmental protection have shown that animals are seriously effected by the noise of the machines .
because the snow makers are turned on only at night animals ’ nocturnal behavior is also altered .
" winter tourism is an important economic factor in the alpine regions .
but the unchecked use of snow machines has long term effects that destroy the landscape , and will ultimately drive away the tourists , " says steindlegger .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .
overall , the earth has warmed about one degree celsius over the past 100 years . no winter ? mojib latif , a climatologist at the leibniz institute for marine studies in kiel , germany , told the newspaper die welt he thinks germany will only get warmer : " according to our climate models , in 2100 there will be 50 fewer days of frost in germany .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ski marathon in switzerland , 2004 but what sounds like a dream to those who do n't like the chilly northern european climate is a nightmare for the ski-tourism industry – especially in germany . compared to switzerland , austria or france , germany has more smaller , low-lying resort areas that tend to have invested less in modern updates , like snow-making machines and lifts , over the past decade . ' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .

skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .
overall , the earth has warmed about one degree celsius over the past 100 years . no winter ? mojib latif , a climatologist at the leibniz institute for marine studies in kiel , germany , told the newspaper die welt he thinks germany will only get warmer : " according to our climate models , in 2100 there will be 50 fewer days of frost in germany .

' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .

skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.01.2005 east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .
its citizens aged from 35 to 50 were also in the midst of their adult lives back then .
but for the majority , hopes of a better future have been dashed . mixed feelings and disappointment - that sums up the general view of east germans aged 50 and up , according to a new report by the charitable organization , volkssolidarität . the " social report 50plus 2005 " found that while most east germans say they are satisfied with their lives , when asked specifically about their expectations for reunification , 69 percent said things were worse than expected 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall . job worries jobs are the biggest source of worry , said prof. gunnar winkler , head of volkssolidarität . " our organization is again having to fight suggestions to keep people working beyond the age of 65 - suggestions which only aim to cut pension payments , " winkler said . " and such demands can only have an impact if there were jobs for every senior citizen who wanted to continue working .

its citizens aged from 35 to 50 were also in the midst of their adult lives back then .
but for the majority , hopes of a better future have been dashed . mixed feelings and disappointment - that sums up the general view of east germans aged 50 and up , according to a new report by the charitable organization , volkssolidarität . the " social report 50plus 2005 " found that while most east germans say they are satisfied with their lives , when asked specifically about their expectations for reunification , 69 percent said things were worse than expected 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall . job worries jobs are the biggest source of worry , said prof. gunnar winkler , head of volkssolidarität . " our organization is again having to fight suggestions to keep people working beyond the age of 65 - suggestions which only aim to cut pension payments , " winkler said . " and such demands can only have an impact if there were jobs for every senior citizen who wanted to continue working . " according to winkler , germany 's eastern states lack almost a million jobs for the 50 - 65 age group alone .
only 41 percent of people in this group currently have jobs , almost a third have already retired , while almost another third are either unemployed or in job training schemes .
many are earning below average salaries , and are having to get by on small pensions .
they hardly fit the stereotype of the well-to-do german pensioner , said winkler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our organization is also having to combat this notion that everyone age 50 and up is part of the so-called ' inheritance generation ' benefiting from large sums of money , " he said . " that 's not the case in the eastern states , and it only applies to a fraction of the western states .
the historical developments in eastern germany did n't allow , and did n't require anyone to save up large amounts of cash . " lack of savings under the east german socialist system , the state was meant to provide for its citizens from cradle to grave , making private financial resources obsolete .
today , 15 percent of east germans aged 50 to 65 are affected by poverty .
and the number of those whose income lies just above the poverty line is much greater . although the poverty risk of this group is much lower than that for children or single mothers , east germans on the verge of retirement do n't have much ground for optimism - 42 percent responded that they were either " dissatisfied " or " very dissatisfied " with their future prospects . ralf lehnert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fifteen-year hangover as germany marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , the country 's politicians took stock of the state of the nation - and concluded that east-west discrepancies are still cleaving the country .

26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " schröder said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " on wednesday , the plan found enthusiastic takers at a meeting in berlin between the chancellor and representatives from germany 's 16 states and local governments .
several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "
at the same time the chancellor stressed that aid , however important and effective , " could not afford to be just an emergency measure , but had to be sustainable and long-term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents walk past by debris in the town of meulaboh , aceh province , indonesia .
he added that the plan singled out sri lanka and indonesia because they had borne the brunt of the tidal waves .
schröder also welcomed the idea of sponsorship programs for people orphaned in the disaster . before the meeting , schröder 's government agreed on setting up a working group made up of several ministries and representatives of states and local communities .
the group would be answerable to the foreign ministry and would handpick projects as well as prepare concrete aid . foreign minister joschka fischer , who returned from the disaster-hit region on wednesday , urged countries to take long-term action and not simply pay lip service to the tragedy while it was making headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in phuket , thailand .
it was " important to make something positive out of this disaster in the future , " and that partnerships were a good way to do so , he said at a press conference in berlin . " the right idea " many believe that schröder 's suggestion has been enthusiastically welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , last week called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " the proposal also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women quench their thirst from distributed safe water packets in tamil nadu the idea has also sparked interest among german cities . the former capital of bonn plans - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - to set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term .

" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .

dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family . germany 's declining birth rate - just one child is born in the country for every four adults in germany - is often blamed on everything from the poor state of the economy , unemployment , job security to dwindling pension coffers . but a new study commissioned by the magazines eltern -lrb- parents -rrb- and eltern for family has uncovered some rather different reasons for germans shying away from starting a family . it found that three-quarters of the 40,000 men and women questioned wished german society was more child-friendly .
" having kids not sexy anymore " " germany is so hostile towards children that even people without children have noticed , " said marie-luise lewicki , eltern 's editor-in-chief at the study 's presentation on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindergarten children in germany " it is n't sexy to have children in germany , " said lewicki .
" that 's why we do n't only need better daycare and full-day schooling for families , but above all a departure from this kind of thinking in society . "
many germans therefore have chosen to forego their longing to have a family altogether .
welcoming children into society families must be given the feeling that they are welcome in germany with their children , lewicki said .
the study found that while 80 percent of parents found understanding and support in their private lives , publicly the opposite is the case .

academics in particular feel children put them at a disadvantage in their profession .
more state support needed in addition , 37 percent said it 's more difficult to find a place to live with a family than without .
three-quarters of parents said they wished there were more recognition for raising a family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both families with children , as well as childless men and women said they wished there was more state support , even for encouraging mothers to go back to work after having a child .
malte ristau from the federal ministry for family affairs said , however , that family policies had been " delegated to the state " for too long .
ristau called for more responsibility by companies , for example with flexible working hours or childcare possibilities .
44 percent of childless respondents also said they were missing a suitable partner to start a family .

they are part of the special unit kses , which quickly deploys medical service specialists to crisis regions .
in just a few days , a high-tech mobile field hospital will be operative in banda aceh .
the 40 soldiers pull up the tarpaulins between the mud left by the tidal wave .
when the unit has completed that , though , the real work begins .
" we want to mainly step in on short notice , " said senior field doctor thomas harbaum .
" this includes surgery , hygienic aid or helping with mobile troops to cover as many areas as possible . "
indonesia limits access to foreigners indonesia meanwhile asserted its military control over aceh on wednesday , requiring foreigners to register and seek official escorts to avoid what it said was a danger of rebel attacks . the move to lock down the jealously guarded region came as indonesia 's vice president yusuf kalla said foreign troops should leave aceh as soon as they finish their relief missions , staying no longer than three months . " in fact , the sooner the better , " kalla was quoted as saying . before the tsunami hit , indonesia had sealed off aceh to outsiders while it conducted a major military offensive to crush separatists engaged in a long-running independence struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cargo plane carrying relief supplies for the victims of the tsunami catastrophe at banda aceh airport after the devastation on dec .

the challenge of coordination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of people in banda aceh have become homeless back in banda aceh , german lieutenant colonel walter huber schmidt said he is relieved to finally be on site and added that governments limiting access to foreigners was a well-known problem in similar crises .
" in the case of such catastrophes , it 's always a problem that the respective government has to approve the deployment , " schmidt said , adding that the men and women of kses needed another one or two days before being ready to start treating patients .
the second largest problem is the coordination of the many various aid organizations , he added .
" before the tidal wave , two to five airplanes landed at the small airport in banda aceh every day , " schmidt said .
" now , it 's 140 planes .
of course , this has to be coordinated and managed .
this can give the impression that everything is n't running that well . "
medical complications the rainy season has started in the aceh province .
three or four times a day , it buckets down .
while the soldiers get their equipment out of the rain , dredging machines at the banda aceh hospital dig the mud aside .
not a lot survived the flood , only destroyed equipment and beds .
the personnel is gone - dead or missing .
only one thing is certain : the need for help is still huge .
" even 14 days after the tsunami , we are still seeing a lot of surgical complications , such as infected wounds , " harbaum said .
" meanwhile , we 've already got over 20 cases of tetanus in the city .
that is a disease that is not easy to treat here . "
in addition , the doctor said he fears that malaria or dengue fever could develop .
already now , the number of diarrhea and respiratory problems in the homeless camps is growing .
trying to prevent worse colonel fritz wiggers , a doctor in the army reserve , is therefore trying to help already wherever he can .

the suspects are accused of raising funds to provide people with falsified documents for residency under false identities in germany and abroad .

the government creditors are set to agree on freezing debt repayments . many countries hit by the tsunami would be greatly helped by debt relief measures .
a moratorium on payments , for example , would mean that creditor nations would waive loan interest and repayments for a set period of time .
for some countries , creditors are even considering debt cancellation .
the government creditors in the paris club are set to agree wednesday on freezing debt repayments by sri lanka and indonesia .
the club has indicated that this could be just the first stage in aiding countries in the catastrophe region .
more substantial longer-term measures were also under consideration .
the club is an informal , voluntary gathering of 19 large western industrialized nations .
it co-ordinates solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor nations , reaching its decisions on debt relief by consensus .
debt repayment problems creditors are discussing postponing debt repayments by indonesia , sri lanka and somalia .

the government creditors in the paris club are set to agree wednesday on freezing debt repayments by sri lanka and indonesia .
the club has indicated that this could be just the first stage in aiding countries in the catastrophe region .

we want to make people laugh , get them to react and take part .
that 's why the humor rubric is important .
people can send in jokes , we 'll put them on the site , and readers can vote on them .
and we 'll send a gift to the person with the best joke . " whether through humor or hard facts , the internet has a huge potential in the arab world ; some 15 million people there have access to the world wide web .
most of them are young , and many are students .
thus deutsche welle will also concentrate on providing services , such as giving information on how and where to study in germany . the goal of all this , according to palestine-born editor shrouf , is the rapprochement of arabic and western culture . " i hope this website will reach a lot of people in the arabic and islamic world .
and i hope we 'll have a lot of opportunity for interactive dialog to improve the dialog between our world – the arabic world – and the german .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .
this is just a sober assessment , without passing judgment . interview by ibrahim mohamad -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .
this is just a sober assessment , without passing judgment . interview by ibrahim mohamad -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " schröder said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " on wednesday , the plan found enthusiastic takers at a meeting in berlin between the chancellor and representatives from germany 's 16 states and local governments .
several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "
at the same time the chancellor stressed that aid , however important and effective , " could not afford to be just an emergency measure , but had to be sustainable and long-term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents walk past by debris in the town of meulaboh , aceh province , indonesia .
he added that the plan singled out sri lanka and indonesia because they had borne the brunt of the tidal waves .
schröder also welcomed the idea of sponsorship programs for people orphaned in the disaster . before the meeting , schröder 's government agreed on setting up a working group made up of several ministries and representatives of states and local communities .
the group would be answerable to the foreign ministry and would handpick projects as well as prepare concrete aid . foreign minister joschka fischer , who returned from the disaster-hit region on wednesday , urged countries to take long-term action and not simply pay lip service to the tragedy while it was making headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in phuket , thailand .
it was " important to make something positive out of this disaster in the future , " and that partnerships were a good way to do so , he said at a press conference in berlin . " the right idea " many believe that schröder 's suggestion has been enthusiastically welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , last week called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " the proposal also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women quench their thirst from distributed safe water packets in tamil nadu the idea has also sparked interest among german cities . the former capital of bonn plans - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - to set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said last week that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months . " i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone , the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris club freezes south asian debt the paris club of creditor nations announced wednesday an immediate , unconditional debt repayment freeze for indonesia , the seychelles and sri lanka , which were hit by last month 's catastrophic tidal wave .

26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " schröder said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " on wednesday , the plan found enthusiastic takers at a meeting in berlin between the chancellor and representatives from germany 's 16 states and local governments .
several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "
at the same time the chancellor stressed that aid , however important and effective , " could not afford to be just an emergency measure , but had to be sustainable and long-term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents walk past by debris in the town of meulaboh , aceh province , indonesia .
he added that the plan singled out sri lanka and indonesia because they had borne the brunt of the tidal waves .
schröder also welcomed the idea of sponsorship programs for people orphaned in the disaster . before the meeting , schröder 's government agreed on setting up a working group made up of several ministries and representatives of states and local communities .
the group would be answerable to the foreign ministry and would handpick projects as well as prepare concrete aid . foreign minister joschka fischer , who returned from the disaster-hit region on wednesday , urged countries to take long-term action and not simply pay lip service to the tragedy while it was making headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in phuket , thailand .
it was " important to make something positive out of this disaster in the future , " and that partnerships were a good way to do so , he said at a press conference in berlin .

" it is an offer by the paris club that has not yet been formally accepted by the countries concerned : sri lanka , indonesia , and the seychelles , " club president jean-pierre joyuet -lrb- photo -rrb- told a press conference in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet on wednesday " this offer is not tied to any conditions , neither an accord with the imf -lrb- international monetary fund -rrb- , nor to comparable treatment by private creditors as the paris club usually does , " he added . the principle of a debt repayment freeze had been agreed upon last week by the group of seven industrialized nations and several of the 19-member paris club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister herve gaymard earlier in the day , french finance minister herve gaymard had said that other countries in southeast asia and east africa that suffered from the dec .
26 indian ocean tidal wave have " a lower level of indebtedness than the others and do not want their credit rating to be downgraded on international financial markets . " gaymard -lrb- photo -rrb- cited malaysia and thailand as examples . india , thailand do n't seek freeze india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions since accompanying conditions could make it harder or more expensive in the future to obtain credit on international financial markets . that has already happened in the past for indonesia , and two major credit rating agencies have warned jakarta that its sovereign rating could be affected if an evenutual debt restructuring were extended to private creditors such as banks .
but analysts say such a development is unlikely . indonesia nonetheless has a lot riding on obtaining debt relief .
its foreign debt comes to around $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100.7 billion -rrb- , and the country is looking at $ 3 billion in payments this year to service the obligation . bildunterschrift : these satellite images show an overview of southern banda aceh before and after the indian ocean tsunamis . only $ 70 billion of the total figure is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and therefore is eligible for the kind of debt relief that is being discussed . " operating space " foreign minister hasan wirayuda , in paris for the meeting , earlier told a joint news conference in london that indonesia sought " any schemes that would allow us operating space .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .
overall , the earth has warmed about one degree celsius over the past 100 years . no winter ? mojib latif , a climatologist at the leibniz institute for marine studies in kiel , germany , told the newspaper die welt he thinks germany will only get warmer : " according to our climate models , in 2100 there will be 50 fewer days of frost in germany .
we 'll have practically no winter at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ski marathon in switzerland , 2004 but what sounds like a dream to those who do n't like the chilly northern european climate is a nightmare for the ski-tourism industry – especially in germany . compared to switzerland , austria or france , germany has more smaller , low-lying resort areas that tend to have invested less in modern updates , like snow-making machines and lifts , over the past decade . ' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .
only the highest resorts within germany 's borders , like garmisch-partenkirchen , berchtesgaden and oberstdorf , could do business as usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting in the sun at a bavaria ski resort nearly 50 percent of the ski resorts in the german alps could be affected , researchers say .
they note that half of the 1,500 ski lifts in germany lie beneath 1,000 meters . rising temperatures are n't the only problem , however .
skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution . " even snow machines need freezing temperatures , " seiler said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling alpine preservation it 's been almost a decade since european countries decided to work together to preserve the alps .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .
overall , the earth has warmed about one degree celsius over the past 100 years . no winter ? mojib latif , a climatologist at the leibniz institute for marine studies in kiel , germany , told the newspaper die welt he thinks germany will only get warmer : " according to our climate models , in 2100 there will be 50 fewer days of frost in germany .
we 'll have practically no winter at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ski marathon in switzerland , 2004 but what sounds like a dream to those who do n't like the chilly northern european climate is a nightmare for the ski-tourism industry – especially in germany . compared to switzerland , austria or france , germany has more smaller , low-lying resort areas that tend to have invested less in modern updates , like snow-making machines and lifts , over the past decade . ' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .

they note that half of the 1,500 ski lifts in germany lie beneath 1,000 meters . rising temperatures are n't the only problem , however .
skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution .

' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .
only the highest resorts within germany 's borders , like garmisch-partenkirchen , berchtesgaden and oberstdorf , could do business as usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting in the sun at a bavaria ski resort nearly 50 percent of the ski resorts in the german alps could be affected , researchers say .
they note that half of the 1,500 ski lifts in germany lie beneath 1,000 meters . rising temperatures are n't the only problem , however .
skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution . " even snow machines need freezing temperatures , " seiler said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling alpine preservation it 's been almost a decade since european countries decided to work together to preserve the alps .

dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family . germany 's declining birth rate - just one child is born in the country for every four adults in germany - is often blamed on everything from the poor state of the economy , unemployment , job security to dwindling pension coffers . but a new study commissioned by the magazines eltern -lrb- parents -rrb- and eltern for family has uncovered some rather different reasons for germans shying away from starting a family . it found that three-quarters of the 40,000 men and women questioned wished german society was more child-friendly .
" having kids not sexy anymore " " germany is so hostile towards children that even people without children have noticed , " said marie-luise lewicki , eltern 's editor-in-chief at the study 's presentation on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindergarten children in germany " it is n't sexy to have children in germany , " said lewicki .
" that 's why we do n't only need better daycare and full-day schooling for families , but above all a departure from this kind of thinking in society . "
many germans therefore have chosen to forego their longing to have a family altogether .
welcoming children into society families must be given the feeling that they are welcome in germany with their children , lewicki said .
the study found that while 80 percent of parents found understanding and support in their private lives , publicly the opposite is the case .
half of those surveyed said children were considered bothersome in stores or restaurants .

" in the case of such catastrophes , it 's always a problem that the respective government has to approve the deployment , " schmidt said , adding that the men and women of kses needed another one or two days before being ready to start treating patients .
the second largest problem is the coordination of the many various aid organizations , he added .

indonesia limits access to foreigners indonesia meanwhile asserted its military control over aceh on wednesday , requiring foreigners to register and seek official escorts to avoid what it said was a danger of rebel attacks . the move to lock down the jealously guarded region came as indonesia 's vice president yusuf kalla said foreign troops should leave aceh as soon as they finish their relief missions , staying no longer than three months . " in fact , the sooner the better , " kalla was quoted as saying . before the tsunami hit , indonesia had sealed off aceh to outsiders while it conducted a major military offensive to crush separatists engaged in a long-running independence struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cargo plane carrying relief supplies for the victims of the tsunami catastrophe at banda aceh airport after the devastation on dec .

the challenge of coordination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of people in banda aceh have become homeless back in banda aceh , german lieutenant colonel walter huber schmidt said he is relieved to finally be on site and added that governments limiting access to foreigners was a well-known problem in similar crises .
" in the case of such catastrophes , it 's always a problem that the respective government has to approve the deployment , " schmidt said , adding that the men and women of kses needed another one or two days before being ready to start treating patients .
the second largest problem is the coordination of the many various aid organizations , he added .
" before the tidal wave , two to five airplanes landed at the small airport in banda aceh every day , " schmidt said .

of course , this has to be coordinated and managed .

" meanwhile , we 've already got over 20 cases of tetanus in the city .
that is a disease that is not easy to treat here . "
in addition , the doctor said he fears that malaria or dengue fever could develop .
already now , the number of diarrhea and respiratory problems in the homeless camps is growing .
trying to prevent worse colonel fritz wiggers , a doctor in the army reserve , is therefore trying to help already wherever he can .
he 's sitting in one of the many shelters , surrounded by numerous women , handing their children to him .
wiggers has tried to bring some order into the chaos , but he does n't have a lot of options .

' not a threat , but a resource ' " we should encourage a positive attitude towards economic migrants , " he said .
" we should consider them not as a threat but as a possible resource . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-immigration parties like jean-marie le pen 's front nationale , in france , have an increasingly strong following in europe europe needs to attract legal migrants to help boost economic growth and counter the effects of an aging population , frattini said on tuesday .
but the countries opposed to the suggestions – germany and austria strongly among them - argue immigration quotas can only be decided by national governments .
this principle is laid out in the new european constitution , they say . nevertheless , frattini went ahead with his attempt to convince member states to at least discuss a common policy .
while governments would retain their national right to set immigration quotas , the overall european approach could still be made more coherent , he said . seeking debate speaking in brussels on tuesday , he promised an open debate with eu member states , lawmakers , citizens and industry before proposing a draft law on legal migration towards the end of 2005 . " it is decisive , in an expanded european union , that we clarify the immigration regulations – and that we do it in the near future .

" one of the options that the commission will have to decide on is an american-style greencard system , " he said . need for workers brussels argues that legal immigration is needed to boost economic growth in europe in the long run .
ageing populations all over europe will not produce enough workers , frattini said . the european union projects that by 2030 , the eu work force will fall by 20 million , leaving a gap in skilled workers . the strategy of filling this gap with economic migrants might be hard to swallow for europe 's unemployed , with joblessness in the 25 nation block at around 10 percent .
but frattini noted that migrants " usually take jobs that no one wants , or that fill gaps in education and skills . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boatload of illegal immigrants from africa , on the coast of spain the commissioner also noted that by giving migrants the opportunity to legally enter the european union , it might prevent desperate migrants from boarding ships in north africa to reach the shores of italy or spain . " without a unified european approach , we risk having an even greater number of illegal immigrants .
these people then ca n't be integrated , and stay on the margins of society .
personally , i would find that to be a completely unacceptable development . " while he hopes to get the reluctant council of european ministers to agree on a common strategy by the end of the year , frattini said he is aware that his predecessor had failed to reach a consensus on the sensitive issue for the past five years . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

the suspects are accused of raising funds to provide people with falsified documents for residency under false identities in germany and abroad .
they also allegedly gave financial support to groups with the same aims , prosecutors and police officials said in a press conference in the southern city of ulm .
the suspects are furthermore accused of recruiting volunteers for jihad , or islamic holy war .
forged passports , ink stamps and material for forging documents were seized in the searches .
at least 11 of the suspects were detained in custody and the number may rise later in the day .
the hub of the network is based in ulm , but the early morning raids also took place in freiburg , frankfurt , duesseldorf , bonn and berlin .
a total of 57 buildings were raided , including mosques , apartments and long-distance telephone call shops .
the network had no name but was linked to the extremist al tawhid and ansar al-islam groups , martin hofmann of the munich prosecutor 's office said .
in december , germany 's federal prosecutor brought charges against a suspected iraqi member of ansar al-islam who is accused of raising money to smuggle insurgency fighters into iraq .
three men arrested in germany in early december in connection with allegedly planning an attack on iraqi prime minister iyad allawi during his visit to berlin were also suspected of being members of ansar al-islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.01.2005 paris club discusses debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt relief would be welcome help for rebuilding efforts in indonesia the paris club creditor countries kick off a three-day meeting on wednesday to discuss relief measures for tsunami-struck south asian countries .
the government creditors are set to agree on freezing debt repayments . many countries hit by the tsunami would be greatly helped by debt relief measures .
a moratorium on payments , for example , would mean that creditor nations would waive loan interest and repayments for a set period of time .
for some countries , creditors are even considering debt cancellation .
the government creditors in the paris club are set to agree wednesday on freezing debt repayments by sri lanka and indonesia .
the club has indicated that this could be just the first stage in aiding countries in the catastrophe region .
more substantial longer-term measures were also under consideration .
the club is an informal , voluntary gathering of 19 large western industrialized nations .
it co-ordinates solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor nations , reaching its decisions on debt relief by consensus .
debt repayment problems creditors are discussing postponing debt repayments by indonesia , sri lanka and somalia .
but india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions .
these countries have enough economic power to follow through with their financial commitments despite the catastrophe and the costs of rebuilding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation caused by the tsunami is even clearer from above however , the credit rating agency fitch warned earlier this week that countries benefiting from a debt repayment freeze might face problems when it expired .
they would then have to make regular payments in addition to the deferred ones .
the british government wants to persuade paris club members to go beyond a moratorium and approve debt cancellation .
but it is still unclear whether all state and state-guaranteed loans would be affected or only a portion .
french president jacques chirac has so far only endorsed a moratorium .
rodrigo rato , director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , supports a debt moratorium .
countries in the catastrophe region can therefore expect relief in their debts to the imf , too .
indonesia hopes for more in the case of indonesia , german foreign minister joschka fischer said more measures than a moratorium would be considered if it became necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer met with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in jakarta " to my knowledge , britain and the united states are also of this opinion , " said fischer following a meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono on tuesday -lrb- photo -rrb- .
indonesia has been hardest-hit by the catastrophe and is highly in debt .
economics minister aburizal bakrie said he expected western creditors to allow it to freeze $ 3.2 billion in debt repayments through 2006 to help it cope with the tsunami disaster .
" i hope that we can resume debt repayments in 2007 , " said aburizal .
however , debt relief measures would afflict germany 's budget .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has suggested debt cancellation for sri lanka , which owes foreign creditors some $ 7 billion .
the bilateral debts to germany from development and state-guaranteed loans total € 344 million .
if sri lanka 's debts were cancelled , this amount would be missing in germany 's budget at a time when berlin is struggling with a fiscal deficit and record borrowing . karl zawadzky / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un urges donors to keep promises the world has come through for south asia with big financial promises .

' not a threat , but a resource ' " we should encourage a positive attitude towards economic migrants , " he said .
" we should consider them not as a threat but as a possible resource . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-immigration parties like jean-marie le pen 's front nationale , in france , have an increasingly strong following in europe europe needs to attract legal migrants to help boost economic growth and counter the effects of an aging population , frattini said on tuesday .
but the countries opposed to the suggestions – germany and austria strongly among them - argue immigration quotas can only be decided by national governments .
this principle is laid out in the new european constitution , they say . nevertheless , frattini went ahead with his attempt to convince member states to at least discuss a common policy .
while governments would retain their national right to set immigration quotas , the overall european approach could still be made more coherent , he said . seeking debate speaking in brussels on tuesday , he promised an open debate with eu member states , lawmakers , citizens and industry before proposing a draft law on legal migration towards the end of 2005 . " it is decisive , in an expanded european union , that we clarify the immigration regulations – and that we do it in the near future .
potential immigrants should know which rights and responsibilities they have , which possibilities and which limitations there are for economic migrants within the eu , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of german cities have become more multicultural on tuesday , frattini presented a discussion paper , called a green book , which outlines different immigration models .
despite opposition from anti-immigration parties in various countries , one possibility consider would be a quota system like in the united states , frattini said . " one of the options that the commission will have to decide on is an american-style greencard system , " he said . need for workers brussels argues that legal immigration is needed to boost economic growth in europe in the long run .
ageing populations all over europe will not produce enough workers , frattini said . the european union projects that by 2030 , the eu work force will fall by 20 million , leaving a gap in skilled workers . the strategy of filling this gap with economic migrants might be hard to swallow for europe 's unemployed , with joblessness in the 25 nation block at around 10 percent .
but frattini noted that migrants " usually take jobs that no one wants , or that fill gaps in education and skills . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boatload of illegal immigrants from africa , on the coast of spain the commissioner also noted that by giving migrants the opportunity to legally enter the european union , it might prevent desperate migrants from boarding ships in north africa to reach the shores of italy or spain . " without a unified european approach , we risk having an even greater number of illegal immigrants .
these people then ca n't be integrated , and stay on the margins of society .
personally , i would find that to be a completely unacceptable development . " while he hopes to get the reluctant council of european ministers to agree on a common strategy by the end of the year , frattini said he is aware that his predecessor had failed to reach a consensus on the sensitive issue for the past five years . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

the suspects are accused of raising funds to provide people with falsified documents for residency under false identities in germany and abroad .
they also allegedly gave financial support to groups with the same aims , prosecutors and police officials said in a press conference in the southern city of ulm .
the suspects are furthermore accused of recruiting volunteers for jihad , or islamic holy war .
forged passports , ink stamps and material for forging documents were seized in the searches .
at least 11 of the suspects were detained in custody and the number may rise later in the day .
the hub of the network is based in ulm , but the early morning raids also took place in freiburg , frankfurt , duesseldorf , bonn and berlin .
a total of 57 buildings were raided , including mosques , apartments and long-distance telephone call shops .
the network had no name but was linked to the extremist al tawhid and ansar al-islam groups , martin hofmann of the munich prosecutor 's office said .
in december , germany 's federal prosecutor brought charges against a suspected iraqi member of ansar al-islam who is accused of raising money to smuggle insurgency fighters into iraq .
three men arrested in germany in early december in connection with allegedly planning an attack on iraqi prime minister iyad allawi during his visit to berlin were also suspected of being members of ansar al-islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.01.2005 eu seeks common immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner frattini is looking at the us greencard eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe . several eu member states , led by germany and austria , came out opposed to suggestions by the european union 's top immigration official to regulate immigration on a european basis , rather than country-by-country . but the eu justice , freedom and security commissioner franco frattini urged the reluctant eu states to embrace migrants as an opportunity rather than as a threat . ' not a threat , but a resource ' " we should encourage a positive attitude towards economic migrants , " he said .
" we should consider them not as a threat but as a possible resource . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-immigration parties like jean-marie le pen 's front nationale , in france , have an increasingly strong following in europe europe needs to attract legal migrants to help boost economic growth and counter the effects of an aging population , frattini said on tuesday .
but the countries opposed to the suggestions – germany and austria strongly among them - argue immigration quotas can only be decided by national governments .
this principle is laid out in the new european constitution , they say . nevertheless , frattini went ahead with his attempt to convince member states to at least discuss a common policy .
while governments would retain their national right to set immigration quotas , the overall european approach could still be made more coherent , he said . seeking debate speaking in brussels on tuesday , he promised an open debate with eu member states , lawmakers , citizens and industry before proposing a draft law on legal migration towards the end of 2005 . " it is decisive , in an expanded european union , that we clarify the immigration regulations – and that we do it in the near future .
potential immigrants should know which rights and responsibilities they have , which possibilities and which limitations there are for economic migrants within the eu , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of german cities have become more multicultural on tuesday , frattini presented a discussion paper , called a green book , which outlines different immigration models .
despite opposition from anti-immigration parties in various countries , one possibility consider would be a quota system like in the united states , frattini said . " one of the options that the commission will have to decide on is an american-style greencard system , " he said . need for workers brussels argues that legal immigration is needed to boost economic growth in europe in the long run .
ageing populations all over europe will not produce enough workers , frattini said . the european union projects that by 2030 , the eu work force will fall by 20 million , leaving a gap in skilled workers . the strategy of filling this gap with economic migrants might be hard to swallow for europe 's unemployed , with joblessness in the 25 nation block at around 10 percent .
but frattini noted that migrants " usually take jobs that no one wants , or that fill gaps in education and skills . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boatload of illegal immigrants from africa , on the coast of spain the commissioner also noted that by giving migrants the opportunity to legally enter the european union , it might prevent desperate migrants from boarding ships in north africa to reach the shores of italy or spain . " without a unified european approach , we risk having an even greater number of illegal immigrants .
these people then ca n't be integrated , and stay on the margins of society .
personally , i would find that to be a completely unacceptable development . " while he hopes to get the reluctant council of european ministers to agree on a common strategy by the end of the year , frattini said he is aware that his predecessor had failed to reach a consensus on the sensitive issue for the past five years . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .
overall , the earth has warmed about one degree celsius over the past 100 years . no winter ? mojib latif , a climatologist at the leibniz institute for marine studies in kiel , germany , told the newspaper die welt he thinks germany will only get warmer : " according to our climate models , in 2100 there will be 50 fewer days of frost in germany .
we 'll have practically no winter at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ski marathon in switzerland , 2004 but what sounds like a dream to those who do n't like the chilly northern european climate is a nightmare for the ski-tourism industry – especially in germany . compared to switzerland , austria or france , germany has more smaller , low-lying resort areas that tend to have invested less in modern updates , like snow-making machines and lifts , over the past decade . ' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .
only the highest resorts within germany 's borders , like garmisch-partenkirchen , berchtesgaden and oberstdorf , could do business as usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting in the sun at a bavaria ski resort nearly 50 percent of the ski resorts in the german alps could be affected , researchers say .
they note that half of the 1,500 ski lifts in germany lie beneath 1,000 meters . rising temperatures are n't the only problem , however .
skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .

it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .

they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .

the suspects are accused of raising funds to provide people with falsified documents for residency under false identities in germany and abroad .
they also allegedly gave financial support to groups with the same aims , prosecutors and police officials said in a press conference in the southern city of ulm .
the suspects are furthermore accused of recruiting volunteers for jihad , or islamic holy war .
forged passports , ink stamps and material for forging documents were seized in the searches .
at least 11 of the suspects were detained in custody and the number may rise later in the day .
the hub of the network is based in ulm , but the early morning raids also took place in freiburg , frankfurt , duesseldorf , bonn and berlin .
a total of 57 buildings were raided , including mosques , apartments and long-distance telephone call shops .
the network had no name but was linked to the extremist al tawhid and ansar al-islam groups , martin hofmann of the munich prosecutor 's office said .
in december , germany 's federal prosecutor brought charges against a suspected iraqi member of ansar al-islam who is accused of raising money to smuggle insurgency fighters into iraq .
three men arrested in germany in early december in connection with allegedly planning an attack on iraqi prime minister iyad allawi during his visit to berlin were also suspected of being members of ansar al-islam .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .
this is just a sober assessment , without passing judgment . interview by ibrahim mohamad -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.01.2005 paris club discusses debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt relief would be welcome help for rebuilding efforts in indonesia the paris club creditor countries kick off a three-day meeting on wednesday to discuss relief measures for tsunami-struck south asian countries .
the government creditors are set to agree on freezing debt repayments . many countries hit by the tsunami would be greatly helped by debt relief measures .
a moratorium on payments , for example , would mean that creditor nations would waive loan interest and repayments for a set period of time .
for some countries , creditors are even considering debt cancellation .
the government creditors in the paris club are set to agree wednesday on freezing debt repayments by sri lanka and indonesia .
the club has indicated that this could be just the first stage in aiding countries in the catastrophe region .
more substantial longer-term measures were also under consideration .
the club is an informal , voluntary gathering of 19 large western industrialized nations .
it co-ordinates solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor nations , reaching its decisions on debt relief by consensus .
debt repayment problems creditors are discussing postponing debt repayments by indonesia , sri lanka and somalia .
but india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions .
these countries have enough economic power to follow through with their financial commitments despite the catastrophe and the costs of rebuilding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation caused by the tsunami is even clearer from above however , the credit rating agency fitch warned earlier this week that countries benefiting from a debt repayment freeze might face problems when it expired .
they would then have to make regular payments in addition to the deferred ones .
the british government wants to persuade paris club members to go beyond a moratorium and approve debt cancellation .
but it is still unclear whether all state and state-guaranteed loans would be affected or only a portion .
french president jacques chirac has so far only endorsed a moratorium .
rodrigo rato , director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , supports a debt moratorium .
countries in the catastrophe region can therefore expect relief in their debts to the imf , too .
indonesia hopes for more in the case of indonesia , german foreign minister joschka fischer said more measures than a moratorium would be considered if it became necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer met with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in jakarta " to my knowledge , britain and the united states are also of this opinion , " said fischer following a meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono on tuesday -lrb- photo -rrb- .
indonesia has been hardest-hit by the catastrophe and is highly in debt .
economics minister aburizal bakrie said he expected western creditors to allow it to freeze $ 3.2 billion in debt repayments through 2006 to help it cope with the tsunami disaster .
" i hope that we can resume debt repayments in 2007 , " said aburizal .
however , debt relief measures would afflict germany 's budget .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has suggested debt cancellation for sri lanka , which owes foreign creditors some $ 7 billion .
the bilateral debts to germany from development and state-guaranteed loans total € 344 million .
if sri lanka 's debts were cancelled , this amount would be missing in germany 's budget at a time when berlin is struggling with a fiscal deficit and record borrowing . karl zawadzky / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un urges donors to keep promises the world has come through for south asia with big financial promises .

26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " schröder said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " on wednesday , the plan found enthusiastic takers at a meeting in berlin between the chancellor and representatives from germany 's 16 states and local governments .
several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "
at the same time the chancellor stressed that aid , however important and effective , " could not afford to be just an emergency measure , but had to be sustainable and long-term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents walk past by debris in the town of meulaboh , aceh province , indonesia .
he added that the plan singled out sri lanka and indonesia because they had borne the brunt of the tidal waves .
schröder also welcomed the idea of sponsorship programs for people orphaned in the disaster . before the meeting , schröder 's government agreed on setting up a working group made up of several ministries and representatives of states and local communities .
the group would be answerable to the foreign ministry and would handpick projects as well as prepare concrete aid . foreign minister joschka fischer , who returned from the disaster-hit region on wednesday , urged countries to take long-term action and not simply pay lip service to the tragedy while it was making headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in phuket , thailand .
it was " important to make something positive out of this disaster in the future , " and that partnerships were a good way to do so , he said at a press conference in berlin . " the right idea " many believe that schröder 's suggestion has been enthusiastically welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , last week called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " the proposal also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women quench their thirst from distributed safe water packets in tamil nadu the idea has also sparked interest among german cities . the former capital of bonn plans - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - to set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said last week that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months . " i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone , the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris club freezes south asian debt the paris club of creditor nations announced wednesday an immediate , unconditional debt repayment freeze for indonesia , the seychelles and sri lanka , which were hit by last month 's catastrophic tidal wave .

its citizens aged from 35 to 50 were also in the midst of their adult lives back then .
but for the majority , hopes of a better future have been dashed . mixed feelings and disappointment - that sums up the general view of east germans aged 50 and up , according to a new report by the charitable organization , volkssolidarität . the " social report 50plus 2005 " found that while most east germans say they are satisfied with their lives , when asked specifically about their expectations for reunification , 69 percent said things were worse than expected 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall . job worries jobs are the biggest source of worry , said prof. gunnar winkler , head of volkssolidarität . " our organization is again having to fight suggestions to keep people working beyond the age of 65 - suggestions which only aim to cut pension payments , " winkler said . " and such demands can only have an impact if there were jobs for every senior citizen who wanted to continue working . " according to winkler , germany 's eastern states lack almost a million jobs for the 50 - 65 age group alone .
only 41 percent of people in this group currently have jobs , almost a third have already retired , while almost another third are either unemployed or in job training schemes .
many are earning below average salaries , and are having to get by on small pensions .
they hardly fit the stereotype of the well-to-do german pensioner , said winkler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our organization is also having to combat this notion that everyone age 50 and up is part of the so-called ' inheritance generation ' benefiting from large sums of money , " he said . " that 's not the case in the eastern states , and it only applies to a fraction of the western states .
the historical developments in eastern germany did n't allow , and did n't require anyone to save up large amounts of cash . " lack of savings under the east german socialist system , the state was meant to provide for its citizens from cradle to grave , making private financial resources obsolete .
today , 15 percent of east germans aged 50 to 65 are affected by poverty .
and the number of those whose income lies just above the poverty line is much greater . although the poverty risk of this group is much lower than that for children or single mothers , east germans on the verge of retirement do n't have much ground for optimism - 42 percent responded that they were either " dissatisfied " or " very dissatisfied " with their future prospects . ralf lehnert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fifteen-year hangover as germany marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , the country 's politicians took stock of the state of the nation - and concluded that east-west discrepancies are still cleaving the country .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .

' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .

skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .
overall , the earth has warmed about one degree celsius over the past 100 years . no winter ? mojib latif , a climatologist at the leibniz institute for marine studies in kiel , germany , told the newspaper die welt he thinks germany will only get warmer : " according to our climate models , in 2100 there will be 50 fewer days of frost in germany .
we 'll have practically no winter at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ski marathon in switzerland , 2004 but what sounds like a dream to those who do n't like the chilly northern european climate is a nightmare for the ski-tourism industry – especially in germany . compared to switzerland , austria or france , germany has more smaller , low-lying resort areas that tend to have invested less in modern updates , like snow-making machines and lifts , over the past decade . ' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .

they note that half of the 1,500 ski lifts in germany lie beneath 1,000 meters . rising temperatures are n't the only problem , however .
skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .
this is just a sober assessment , without passing judgment . interview by ibrahim mohamad -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.01.2005 paris club discusses debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt relief would be welcome help for rebuilding efforts in indonesia the paris club creditor countries kick off a three-day meeting on wednesday to discuss relief measures for tsunami-struck south asian countries .
the government creditors are set to agree on freezing debt repayments . many countries hit by the tsunami would be greatly helped by debt relief measures .
a moratorium on payments , for example , would mean that creditor nations would waive loan interest and repayments for a set period of time .
for some countries , creditors are even considering debt cancellation .
the government creditors in the paris club are set to agree wednesday on freezing debt repayments by sri lanka and indonesia .
the club has indicated that this could be just the first stage in aiding countries in the catastrophe region .
more substantial longer-term measures were also under consideration .
the club is an informal , voluntary gathering of 19 large western industrialized nations .
it co-ordinates solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor nations , reaching its decisions on debt relief by consensus .
debt repayment problems creditors are discussing postponing debt repayments by indonesia , sri lanka and somalia .
but india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions .
these countries have enough economic power to follow through with their financial commitments despite the catastrophe and the costs of rebuilding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation caused by the tsunami is even clearer from above however , the credit rating agency fitch warned earlier this week that countries benefiting from a debt repayment freeze might face problems when it expired .
they would then have to make regular payments in addition to the deferred ones .
the british government wants to persuade paris club members to go beyond a moratorium and approve debt cancellation .
but it is still unclear whether all state and state-guaranteed loans would be affected or only a portion .
french president jacques chirac has so far only endorsed a moratorium .
rodrigo rato , director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , supports a debt moratorium .

rodrigo rato , director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , supports a debt moratorium .
countries in the catastrophe region can therefore expect relief in their debts to the imf , too .
indonesia hopes for more in the case of indonesia , german foreign minister joschka fischer said more measures than a moratorium would be considered if it became necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer met with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in jakarta " to my knowledge , britain and the united states are also of this opinion , " said fischer following a meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono on tuesday -lrb- photo -rrb- .
indonesia has been hardest-hit by the catastrophe and is highly in debt .
economics minister aburizal bakrie said he expected western creditors to allow it to freeze $ 3.2 billion in debt repayments through 2006 to help it cope with the tsunami disaster .
" i hope that we can resume debt repayments in 2007 , " said aburizal .
however , debt relief measures would afflict germany 's budget .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has suggested debt cancellation for sri lanka , which owes foreign creditors some $ 7 billion .
the bilateral debts to germany from development and state-guaranteed loans total € 344 million .
if sri lanka 's debts were cancelled , this amount would be missing in germany 's budget at a time when berlin is struggling with a fiscal deficit and record borrowing . karl zawadzky / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un urges donors to keep promises the world has come through for south asia with big financial promises .

the suspects are accused of raising funds to provide people with falsified documents for residency under false identities in germany and abroad .
they also allegedly gave financial support to groups with the same aims , prosecutors and police officials said in a press conference in the southern city of ulm .
the suspects are furthermore accused of recruiting volunteers for jihad , or islamic holy war .
forged passports , ink stamps and material for forging documents were seized in the searches .
at least 11 of the suspects were detained in custody and the number may rise later in the day .
the hub of the network is based in ulm , but the early morning raids also took place in freiburg , frankfurt , duesseldorf , bonn and berlin .
a total of 57 buildings were raided , including mosques , apartments and long-distance telephone call shops .
the network had no name but was linked to the extremist al tawhid and ansar al-islam groups , martin hofmann of the munich prosecutor 's office said .
in december , germany 's federal prosecutor brought charges against a suspected iraqi member of ansar al-islam who is accused of raising money to smuggle insurgency fighters into iraq .
three men arrested in germany in early december in connection with allegedly planning an attack on iraqi prime minister iyad allawi during his visit to berlin were also suspected of being members of ansar al-islam .

" it is an offer by the paris club that has not yet been formally accepted by the countries concerned : sri lanka , indonesia , and the seychelles , " club president jean-pierre joyuet -lrb- photo -rrb- told a press conference in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet on wednesday " this offer is not tied to any conditions , neither an accord with the imf -lrb- international monetary fund -rrb- , nor to comparable treatment by private creditors as the paris club usually does , " he added . the principle of a debt repayment freeze had been agreed upon last week by the group of seven industrialized nations and several of the 19-member paris club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister herve gaymard earlier in the day , french finance minister herve gaymard had said that other countries in southeast asia and east africa that suffered from the dec .
26 indian ocean tidal wave have " a lower level of indebtedness than the others and do not want their credit rating to be downgraded on international financial markets . " gaymard -lrb- photo -rrb- cited malaysia and thailand as examples . india , thailand do n't seek freeze india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions since accompanying conditions could make it harder or more expensive in the future to obtain credit on international financial markets . that has already happened in the past for indonesia , and two major credit rating agencies have warned jakarta that its sovereign rating could be affected if an evenutual debt restructuring were extended to private creditors such as banks .
but analysts say such a development is unlikely . indonesia nonetheless has a lot riding on obtaining debt relief .
its foreign debt comes to around $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100.7 billion -rrb- , and the country is looking at $ 3 billion in payments this year to service the obligation . bildunterschrift : these satellite images show an overview of southern banda aceh before and after the indian ocean tsunamis . only $ 70 billion of the total figure is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and therefore is eligible for the kind of debt relief that is being discussed . " operating space " foreign minister hasan wirayuda , in paris for the meeting , earlier told a joint news conference in london that indonesia sought " any schemes that would allow us operating space . " sri lanka 's foreign debt is roughly $ 7.7 billion . jean-francois cope , france 's budget minister , has described the actions taken by the paris club as a first step , which after a needs assessment by international financial bodies could lead to " complementary measures . " germany supports further relief germany and several other rich countries have already voiced support for deeper debt relief for countries devastated by the tidal wave , which killed at least 157,000 people . but gaymard has argued against lumping together discussions on easing all forms of debt .
for non-governmental organizations , re-scheduling and suspensions are far from sufficient , however . a rally was scheduled wednesday outside the french finance ministry , where the paris club is meeting , to demand that the debt of tsunami-hit countries be cancelled and that the united nations convene an international conference on the question . g-8 for international tax beyond the disaster in southeast asia , france - in upcoming meetings with its leading industrialized partners in the group of eight - wants to revive a proposal for an international tax to finance development aid , gaymard said . britain , current head of the group of eight , has recently called for a " new marshall plan " for the developing world in order to cancel an estimated $ 80 billion in debt owed by poor countries . the group of eight comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris club discusses debt relief the paris club creditor countries kick off a three-day meeting on wednesday to discuss relief measures for tsunami-struck south asian countries .

its citizens aged from 35 to 50 were also in the midst of their adult lives back then .
but for the majority , hopes of a better future have been dashed . mixed feelings and disappointment - that sums up the general view of east germans aged 50 and up , according to a new report by the charitable organization , volkssolidarität . the " social report 50plus 2005 " found that while most east germans say they are satisfied with their lives , when asked specifically about their expectations for reunification , 69 percent said things were worse than expected 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall . job worries jobs are the biggest source of worry , said prof. gunnar winkler , head of volkssolidarität . " our organization is again having to fight suggestions to keep people working beyond the age of 65 - suggestions which only aim to cut pension payments , " winkler said . " and such demands can only have an impact if there were jobs for every senior citizen who wanted to continue working . " according to winkler , germany 's eastern states lack almost a million jobs for the 50 - 65 age group alone .
only 41 percent of people in this group currently have jobs , almost a third have already retired , while almost another third are either unemployed or in job training schemes .
many are earning below average salaries , and are having to get by on small pensions .
they hardly fit the stereotype of the well-to-do german pensioner , said winkler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our organization is also having to combat this notion that everyone age 50 and up is part of the so-called ' inheritance generation ' benefiting from large sums of money , " he said . " that 's not the case in the eastern states , and it only applies to a fraction of the western states .
the historical developments in eastern germany did n't allow , and did n't require anyone to save up large amounts of cash . " lack of savings under the east german socialist system , the state was meant to provide for its citizens from cradle to grave , making private financial resources obsolete .
today , 15 percent of east germans aged 50 to 65 are affected by poverty .
and the number of those whose income lies just above the poverty line is much greater . although the poverty risk of this group is much lower than that for children or single mothers , east germans on the verge of retirement do n't have much ground for optimism - 42 percent responded that they were either " dissatisfied " or " very dissatisfied " with their future prospects . ralf lehnert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fifteen-year hangover as germany marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , the country 's politicians took stock of the state of the nation - and concluded that east-west discrepancies are still cleaving the country .

26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " schröder said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " on wednesday , the plan found enthusiastic takers at a meeting in berlin between the chancellor and representatives from germany 's 16 states and local governments .
several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "
at the same time the chancellor stressed that aid , however important and effective , " could not afford to be just an emergency measure , but had to be sustainable and long-term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents walk past by debris in the town of meulaboh , aceh province , indonesia .
he added that the plan singled out sri lanka and indonesia because they had borne the brunt of the tidal waves .
schröder also welcomed the idea of sponsorship programs for people orphaned in the disaster . before the meeting , schröder 's government agreed on setting up a working group made up of several ministries and representatives of states and local communities .

it was " important to make something positive out of this disaster in the future , " and that partnerships were a good way to do so , he said at a press conference in berlin .

" the proposal also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .

26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " schröder said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " on wednesday , the plan found enthusiastic takers at a meeting in berlin between the chancellor and representatives from germany 's 16 states and local governments .
several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "
at the same time the chancellor stressed that aid , however important and effective , " could not afford to be just an emergency measure , but had to be sustainable and long-term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents walk past by debris in the town of meulaboh , aceh province , indonesia .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .
overall , the earth has warmed about one degree celsius over the past 100 years . no winter ? mojib latif , a climatologist at the leibniz institute for marine studies in kiel , germany , told the newspaper die welt he thinks germany will only get warmer : " according to our climate models , in 2100 there will be 50 fewer days of frost in germany .
we 'll have practically no winter at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ski marathon in switzerland , 2004 but what sounds like a dream to those who do n't like the chilly northern european climate is a nightmare for the ski-tourism industry – especially in germany . compared to switzerland , austria or france , germany has more smaller , low-lying resort areas that tend to have invested less in modern updates , like snow-making machines and lifts , over the past decade . ' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .

they note that half of the 1,500 ski lifts in germany lie beneath 1,000 meters . rising temperatures are n't the only problem , however .
skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .

it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .
overall , the earth has warmed about one degree celsius over the past 100 years . no winter ? mojib latif , a climatologist at the leibniz institute for marine studies in kiel , germany , told the newspaper die welt he thinks germany will only get warmer : " according to our climate models , in 2100 there will be 50 fewer days of frost in germany .
we 'll have practically no winter at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ski marathon in switzerland , 2004 but what sounds like a dream to those who do n't like the chilly northern european climate is a nightmare for the ski-tourism industry – especially in germany . compared to switzerland , austria or france , germany has more smaller , low-lying resort areas that tend to have invested less in modern updates , like snow-making machines and lifts , over the past decade . ' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .

they note that half of the 1,500 ski lifts in germany lie beneath 1,000 meters . rising temperatures are n't the only problem , however .
skiers need snow , but precipitation in the month of january - the height of ski season - is expected to drop one-fifth by 2035 , seiler told the stadt anzeiger .
precipitation is expected to increase by one-third in march and april , however .
then , the snow that does fall will come increasingly in the form of storms , which would increase the likelihood of avalanches . should they occur , such climate changes would deal a near-deadly blow to the lower lying resorts , which rely heavily on ski season revenues . the german economic institute for tourism research -lrb- dwif -rrb- at the university of munich noted that skiing has actually been stagnant for years , with just 13 percent of germans taking up the sport today as opposed to 16 percent 10 years ago . germans in austria the head of the association of german funicular and chair lifts , wolfgang bosche , told the stadt anzeiger that hardly any of germany 's 162 chair lifts and funiculars can break even based on winter use alone ; summer tourists who ride the lifts for hiking and mountain biking help keep the bills paid . meanwhile , austrians have taken to calling themselves " the country where germany goes to ski , " and makers of snow machines are seeing a potential boom in the climate changes . seiler warned that even if german resorts begin making more snow – an expensive proposition at € 3 per cubic meter – this would be a short term solution .

the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts . if the unseasonable weather keeps up , this january will turn out to be the warmest ever in germany , with temperatures around six degrees higher than normal , according to riek schaab of the german weather service in offenbach . for an explanation , scientists point to global warming .
overall , the earth has warmed about one degree celsius over the past 100 years . no winter ? mojib latif , a climatologist at the leibniz institute for marine studies in kiel , germany , told the newspaper die welt he thinks germany will only get warmer : " according to our climate models , in 2100 there will be 50 fewer days of frost in germany .
we 'll have practically no winter at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ski marathon in switzerland , 2004 but what sounds like a dream to those who do n't like the chilly northern european climate is a nightmare for the ski-tourism industry – especially in germany . compared to switzerland , austria or france , germany has more smaller , low-lying resort areas that tend to have invested less in modern updates , like snow-making machines and lifts , over the past decade . ' big losers ' " winter sports resorts in low-lying areas and in the northern area of the alps are going to be the big losers , " wolfgang seiler , a meteorologist with the meteorology and climate research center in karlsruhe , told the kölner stadt anzeiger newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter athletes enjoy the snow and at chiemgau in southern germany seiler agreed with researchers who say they expect global temperatures to rise overall by one degree celsius by 2035 , albeit with enormous regional differences .
in the alps , seiler said temperatures could rise between two and three degrees celsius , especially in winter .
that means the snow line - the altitude at which snow stays on the ground - would rise from around 1,000 meters to 1,500 meters . need for snow if that climate change were to come about , then an annual snowfall would no longer be certain in the vast majority of german ski resorts .
only the highest resorts within germany 's borders , like garmisch-partenkirchen , berchtesgaden and oberstdorf , could do business as usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting in the sun at a bavaria ski resort nearly 50 percent of the ski resorts in the german alps could be affected , researchers say .
they note that half of the 1,500 ski lifts in germany lie beneath 1,000 meters . rising temperatures are n't the only problem , however .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .
this is just a sober assessment , without passing judgment . interview by ibrahim mohamad -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family . germany 's declining birth rate - just one child is born in the country for every four adults in germany - is often blamed on everything from the poor state of the economy , unemployment , job security to dwindling pension coffers . but a new study commissioned by the magazines eltern -lrb- parents -rrb- and eltern for family has uncovered some rather different reasons for germans shying away from starting a family . it found that three-quarters of the 40,000 men and women questioned wished german society was more child-friendly .
" having kids not sexy anymore " " germany is so hostile towards children that even people without children have noticed , " said marie-luise lewicki , eltern 's editor-in-chief at the study 's presentation on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindergarten children in germany " it is n't sexy to have children in germany , " said lewicki .
" that 's why we do n't only need better daycare and full-day schooling for families , but above all a departure from this kind of thinking in society . "
many germans therefore have chosen to forego their longing to have a family altogether .
welcoming children into society families must be given the feeling that they are welcome in germany with their children , lewicki said .
the study found that while 80 percent of parents found understanding and support in their private lives , publicly the opposite is the case .
half of those surveyed said children were considered bothersome in stores or restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same , apparently , is the case at the workplace , the study found . many bosses show lack of understanding when it comes to working overtime .
for 42 percent of mothers , children are simply " career killers . "
academics in particular feel children put them at a disadvantage in their profession .
more state support needed in addition , 37 percent said it 's more difficult to find a place to live with a family than without .
three-quarters of parents said they wished there were more recognition for raising a family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both families with children , as well as childless men and women said they wished there was more state support , even for encouraging mothers to go back to work after having a child .
malte ristau from the federal ministry for family affairs said , however , that family policies had been " delegated to the state " for too long .
ristau called for more responsibility by companies , for example with flexible working hours or childcare possibilities .
44 percent of childless respondents also said they were missing a suitable partner to start a family .
every third person surveyed expressed concern about his or her job .
family still number one the number of births in germany has been cut in half over the past 40 years .

dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family . germany 's declining birth rate - just one child is born in the country for every four adults in germany - is often blamed on everything from the poor state of the economy , unemployment , job security to dwindling pension coffers . but a new study commissioned by the magazines eltern -lrb- parents -rrb- and eltern for family has uncovered some rather different reasons for germans shying away from starting a family . it found that three-quarters of the 40,000 men and women questioned wished german society was more child-friendly .
" having kids not sexy anymore " " germany is so hostile towards children that even people without children have noticed , " said marie-luise lewicki , eltern 's editor-in-chief at the study 's presentation on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindergarten children in germany " it is n't sexy to have children in germany , " said lewicki .
" that 's why we do n't only need better daycare and full-day schooling for families , but above all a departure from this kind of thinking in society . "
many germans therefore have chosen to forego their longing to have a family altogether .
welcoming children into society families must be given the feeling that they are welcome in germany with their children , lewicki said .
the study found that while 80 percent of parents found understanding and support in their private lives , publicly the opposite is the case .
half of those surveyed said children were considered bothersome in stores or restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same , apparently , is the case at the workplace , the study found . many bosses show lack of understanding when it comes to working overtime .
for 42 percent of mothers , children are simply " career killers . "
academics in particular feel children put them at a disadvantage in their profession .
more state support needed in addition , 37 percent said it 's more difficult to find a place to live with a family than without .
three-quarters of parents said they wished there were more recognition for raising a family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both families with children , as well as childless men and women said they wished there was more state support , even for encouraging mothers to go back to work after having a child .
malte ristau from the federal ministry for family affairs said , however , that family policies had been " delegated to the state " for too long .
ristau called for more responsibility by companies , for example with flexible working hours or childcare possibilities .
44 percent of childless respondents also said they were missing a suitable partner to start a family .
every third person surveyed expressed concern about his or her job .
family still number one the number of births in germany has been cut in half over the past 40 years .
in 1964 , close to 1.4 million children were born in east and west germany .
four decades later , this figure has sunk to 706,000 .
still , family does play a major role for germans .
a total of 89 percent of those questioned said family was the most important part of their lives .
their careers came in second - with six percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de childcare study shows : east beats west a european study on german daycare praised the eastern part of the country and criticized the west for its meager offerings for preschoolers .

" after the attacks on new york , at the very latest , it became clear to everyone that there are gaps in the dialogue between the arab nations and the west , " hank said .
" that 's why deutsche welle is concentrating on the arabic language .
the online service is taking the lead , and we believe that the internet provides a good opportunity for to promote a dialog . " interactivity is key the online media 's interactivity makes it a good place to start , hank said .
" it offers people a natural forum to exchange ideas , and can flow in both directions .

that 's why the humor rubric is important .
people can send in jokes , we 'll put them on the site , and readers can vote on them .
and we 'll send a gift to the person with the best joke . " whether through humor or hard facts , the internet has a huge potential in the arab world ; some 15 million people there have access to the world wide web .
most of them are young , and many are students .
thus deutsche welle will also concentrate on providing services , such as giving information on how and where to study in germany . the goal of all this , according to palestine-born editor shrouf , is the rapprochement of arabic and western culture .

dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family . germany 's declining birth rate - just one child is born in the country for every four adults in germany - is often blamed on everything from the poor state of the economy , unemployment , job security to dwindling pension coffers . but a new study commissioned by the magazines eltern -lrb- parents -rrb- and eltern for family has uncovered some rather different reasons for germans shying away from starting a family . it found that three-quarters of the 40,000 men and women questioned wished german society was more child-friendly .
" having kids not sexy anymore " " germany is so hostile towards children that even people without children have noticed , " said marie-luise lewicki , eltern 's editor-in-chief at the study 's presentation on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindergarten children in germany " it is n't sexy to have children in germany , " said lewicki .
" that 's why we do n't only need better daycare and full-day schooling for families , but above all a departure from this kind of thinking in society . "
many germans therefore have chosen to forego their longing to have a family altogether .
welcoming children into society families must be given the feeling that they are welcome in germany with their children , lewicki said .
the study found that while 80 percent of parents found understanding and support in their private lives , publicly the opposite is the case .
half of those surveyed said children were considered bothersome in stores or restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same , apparently , is the case at the workplace , the study found . many bosses show lack of understanding when it comes to working overtime .
for 42 percent of mothers , children are simply " career killers . "
academics in particular feel children put them at a disadvantage in their profession .
more state support needed in addition , 37 percent said it 's more difficult to find a place to live with a family than without .
three-quarters of parents said they wished there were more recognition for raising a family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both families with children , as well as childless men and women said they wished there was more state support , even for encouraging mothers to go back to work after having a child .
malte ristau from the federal ministry for family affairs said , however , that family policies had been " delegated to the state " for too long .
ristau called for more responsibility by companies , for example with flexible working hours or childcare possibilities .
44 percent of childless respondents also said they were missing a suitable partner to start a family .
every third person surveyed expressed concern about his or her job .
family still number one the number of births in germany has been cut in half over the past 40 years .
in 1964 , close to 1.4 million children were born in east and west germany .
four decades later , this figure has sunk to 706,000 .
still , family does play a major role for germans .
a total of 89 percent of those questioned said family was the most important part of their lives .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .

dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family . germany 's declining birth rate - just one child is born in the country for every four adults in germany - is often blamed on everything from the poor state of the economy , unemployment , job security to dwindling pension coffers . but a new study commissioned by the magazines eltern -lrb- parents -rrb- and eltern for family has uncovered some rather different reasons for germans shying away from starting a family . it found that three-quarters of the 40,000 men and women questioned wished german society was more child-friendly .
" having kids not sexy anymore " " germany is so hostile towards children that even people without children have noticed , " said marie-luise lewicki , eltern 's editor-in-chief at the study 's presentation on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindergarten children in germany " it is n't sexy to have children in germany , " said lewicki .
" that 's why we do n't only need better daycare and full-day schooling for families , but above all a departure from this kind of thinking in society . "
many germans therefore have chosen to forego their longing to have a family altogether .
welcoming children into society families must be given the feeling that they are welcome in germany with their children , lewicki said .
the study found that while 80 percent of parents found understanding and support in their private lives , publicly the opposite is the case .
half of those surveyed said children were considered bothersome in stores or restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same , apparently , is the case at the workplace , the study found . many bosses show lack of understanding when it comes to working overtime .
for 42 percent of mothers , children are simply " career killers . "
academics in particular feel children put them at a disadvantage in their profession .
more state support needed in addition , 37 percent said it 's more difficult to find a place to live with a family than without .
three-quarters of parents said they wished there were more recognition for raising a family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both families with children , as well as childless men and women said they wished there was more state support , even for encouraging mothers to go back to work after having a child .
malte ristau from the federal ministry for family affairs said , however , that family policies had been " delegated to the state " for too long .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.01.2005 east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .
its citizens aged from 35 to 50 were also in the midst of their adult lives back then .
but for the majority , hopes of a better future have been dashed . mixed feelings and disappointment - that sums up the general view of east germans aged 50 and up , according to a new report by the charitable organization , volkssolidarität . the " social report 50plus 2005 " found that while most east germans say they are satisfied with their lives , when asked specifically about their expectations for reunification , 69 percent said things were worse than expected 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall . job worries jobs are the biggest source of worry , said prof. gunnar winkler , head of volkssolidarität . " our organization is again having to fight suggestions to keep people working beyond the age of 65 - suggestions which only aim to cut pension payments , " winkler said . " and such demands can only have an impact if there were jobs for every senior citizen who wanted to continue working . " according to winkler , germany 's eastern states lack almost a million jobs for the 50 - 65 age group alone .
only 41 percent of people in this group currently have jobs , almost a third have already retired , while almost another third are either unemployed or in job training schemes .

' not a threat , but a resource ' " we should encourage a positive attitude towards economic migrants , " he said .
" we should consider them not as a threat but as a possible resource . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-immigration parties like jean-marie le pen 's front nationale , in france , have an increasingly strong following in europe europe needs to attract legal migrants to help boost economic growth and counter the effects of an aging population , frattini said on tuesday .
but the countries opposed to the suggestions – germany and austria strongly among them - argue immigration quotas can only be decided by national governments .
this principle is laid out in the new european constitution , they say . nevertheless , frattini went ahead with his attempt to convince member states to at least discuss a common policy .
while governments would retain their national right to set immigration quotas , the overall european approach could still be made more coherent , he said . seeking debate speaking in brussels on tuesday , he promised an open debate with eu member states , lawmakers , citizens and industry before proposing a draft law on legal migration towards the end of 2005 . " it is decisive , in an expanded european union , that we clarify the immigration regulations – and that we do it in the near future .
potential immigrants should know which rights and responsibilities they have , which possibilities and which limitations there are for economic migrants within the eu , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of german cities have become more multicultural on tuesday , frattini presented a discussion paper , called a green book , which outlines different immigration models .
despite opposition from anti-immigration parties in various countries , one possibility consider would be a quota system like in the united states , frattini said . " one of the options that the commission will have to decide on is an american-style greencard system , " he said . need for workers brussels argues that legal immigration is needed to boost economic growth in europe in the long run .
ageing populations all over europe will not produce enough workers , frattini said . the european union projects that by 2030 , the eu work force will fall by 20 million , leaving a gap in skilled workers . the strategy of filling this gap with economic migrants might be hard to swallow for europe 's unemployed , with joblessness in the 25 nation block at around 10 percent .
but frattini noted that migrants " usually take jobs that no one wants , or that fill gaps in education and skills . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boatload of illegal immigrants from africa , on the coast of spain the commissioner also noted that by giving migrants the opportunity to legally enter the european union , it might prevent desperate migrants from boarding ships in north africa to reach the shores of italy or spain . " without a unified european approach , we risk having an even greater number of illegal immigrants .
these people then ca n't be integrated , and stay on the margins of society .
personally , i would find that to be a completely unacceptable development . " while he hopes to get the reluctant council of european ministers to agree on a common strategy by the end of the year , frattini said he is aware that his predecessor had failed to reach a consensus on the sensitive issue for the past five years . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

the suspects are accused of raising funds to provide people with falsified documents for residency under false identities in germany and abroad .
they also allegedly gave financial support to groups with the same aims , prosecutors and police officials said in a press conference in the southern city of ulm .
the suspects are furthermore accused of recruiting volunteers for jihad , or islamic holy war .
forged passports , ink stamps and material for forging documents were seized in the searches .
at least 11 of the suspects were detained in custody and the number may rise later in the day .
the hub of the network is based in ulm , but the early morning raids also took place in freiburg , frankfurt , duesseldorf , bonn and berlin .
a total of 57 buildings were raided , including mosques , apartments and long-distance telephone call shops .
the network had no name but was linked to the extremist al tawhid and ansar al-islam groups , martin hofmann of the munich prosecutor 's office said .
in december , germany 's federal prosecutor brought charges against a suspected iraqi member of ansar al-islam who is accused of raising money to smuggle insurgency fighters into iraq .
three men arrested in germany in early december in connection with allegedly planning an attack on iraqi prime minister iyad allawi during his visit to berlin were also suspected of being members of ansar al-islam .

the suspects are accused of raising funds to provide people with falsified documents for residency under false identities in germany and abroad .
they also allegedly gave financial support to groups with the same aims , prosecutors and police officials said in a press conference in the southern city of ulm .
the suspects are furthermore accused of recruiting volunteers for jihad , or islamic holy war .
forged passports , ink stamps and material for forging documents were seized in the searches .
at least 11 of the suspects were detained in custody and the number may rise later in the day .
the hub of the network is based in ulm , but the early morning raids also took place in freiburg , frankfurt , duesseldorf , bonn and berlin .
a total of 57 buildings were raided , including mosques , apartments and long-distance telephone call shops .
the network had no name but was linked to the extremist al tawhid and ansar al-islam groups , martin hofmann of the munich prosecutor 's office said .
in december , germany 's federal prosecutor brought charges against a suspected iraqi member of ansar al-islam who is accused of raising money to smuggle insurgency fighters into iraq .
three men arrested in germany in early december in connection with allegedly planning an attack on iraqi prime minister iyad allawi during his visit to berlin were also suspected of being members of ansar al-islam .

" after the attacks on new york , at the very latest , it became clear to everyone that there are gaps in the dialogue between the arab nations and the west , " hank said .
" that 's why deutsche welle is concentrating on the arabic language .
the online service is taking the lead , and we believe that the internet provides a good opportunity for to promote a dialog . " interactivity is key the online media 's interactivity makes it a good place to start , hank said .
" it offers people a natural forum to exchange ideas , and can flow in both directions .
that 's why arabic is an important language for us to publish in . " interactive elements online , such as polls or forums , are an important part of dw-world 's arabic site .

we do n't want our site to be dry and dull .
we want to make people laugh , get them to react and take part .
that 's why the humor rubric is important .
people can send in jokes , we 'll put them on the site , and readers can vote on them .
and we 'll send a gift to the person with the best joke . " whether through humor or hard facts , the internet has a huge potential in the arab world ; some 15 million people there have access to the world wide web .
most of them are young , and many are students .
thus deutsche welle will also concentrate on providing services , such as giving information on how and where to study in germany . the goal of all this , according to palestine-born editor shrouf , is the rapprochement of arabic and western culture . " i hope this website will reach a lot of people in the arabic and islamic world .

the suspects are accused of raising funds to provide people with falsified documents for residency under false identities in germany and abroad .
they also allegedly gave financial support to groups with the same aims , prosecutors and police officials said in a press conference in the southern city of ulm .
the suspects are furthermore accused of recruiting volunteers for jihad , or islamic holy war .
forged passports , ink stamps and material for forging documents were seized in the searches .
at least 11 of the suspects were detained in custody and the number may rise later in the day .
the hub of the network is based in ulm , but the early morning raids also took place in freiburg , frankfurt , duesseldorf , bonn and berlin .
a total of 57 buildings were raided , including mosques , apartments and long-distance telephone call shops .
the network had no name but was linked to the extremist al tawhid and ansar al-islam groups , martin hofmann of the munich prosecutor 's office said .
in december , germany 's federal prosecutor brought charges against a suspected iraqi member of ansar al-islam who is accused of raising money to smuggle insurgency fighters into iraq .
three men arrested in germany in early december in connection with allegedly planning an attack on iraqi prime minister iyad allawi during his visit to berlin were also suspected of being members of ansar al-islam .

the government creditors are set to agree on freezing debt repayments . many countries hit by the tsunami would be greatly helped by debt relief measures .

the government creditors are set to agree on freezing debt repayments . many countries hit by the tsunami would be greatly helped by debt relief measures .
a moratorium on payments , for example , would mean that creditor nations would waive loan interest and repayments for a set period of time .
for some countries , creditors are even considering debt cancellation .
the government creditors in the paris club are set to agree wednesday on freezing debt repayments by sri lanka and indonesia .
the club has indicated that this could be just the first stage in aiding countries in the catastrophe region .
more substantial longer-term measures were also under consideration .
the club is an informal , voluntary gathering of 19 large western industrialized nations .
it co-ordinates solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor nations , reaching its decisions on debt relief by consensus .
debt repayment problems creditors are discussing postponing debt repayments by indonesia , sri lanka and somalia .
but india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions .
these countries have enough economic power to follow through with their financial commitments despite the catastrophe and the costs of rebuilding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation caused by the tsunami is even clearer from above however , the credit rating agency fitch warned earlier this week that countries benefiting from a debt repayment freeze might face problems when it expired .
they would then have to make regular payments in addition to the deferred ones .
the british government wants to persuade paris club members to go beyond a moratorium and approve debt cancellation .
but it is still unclear whether all state and state-guaranteed loans would be affected or only a portion .
french president jacques chirac has so far only endorsed a moratorium .
rodrigo rato , director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , supports a debt moratorium .
countries in the catastrophe region can therefore expect relief in their debts to the imf , too .
indonesia hopes for more in the case of indonesia , german foreign minister joschka fischer said more measures than a moratorium would be considered if it became necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer met with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in jakarta " to my knowledge , britain and the united states are also of this opinion , " said fischer following a meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono on tuesday -lrb- photo -rrb- .
indonesia has been hardest-hit by the catastrophe and is highly in debt .
economics minister aburizal bakrie said he expected western creditors to allow it to freeze $ 3.2 billion in debt repayments through 2006 to help it cope with the tsunami disaster .
" i hope that we can resume debt repayments in 2007 , " said aburizal .
however , debt relief measures would afflict germany 's budget .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has suggested debt cancellation for sri lanka , which owes foreign creditors some $ 7 billion .
the bilateral debts to germany from development and state-guaranteed loans total € 344 million .
if sri lanka 's debts were cancelled , this amount would be missing in germany 's budget at a time when berlin is struggling with a fiscal deficit and record borrowing . karl zawadzky / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un urges donors to keep promises the world has come through for south asia with big financial promises .

" it is an offer by the paris club that has not yet been formally accepted by the countries concerned : sri lanka , indonesia , and the seychelles , " club president jean-pierre joyuet -lrb- photo -rrb- told a press conference in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet on wednesday " this offer is not tied to any conditions , neither an accord with the imf -lrb- international monetary fund -rrb- , nor to comparable treatment by private creditors as the paris club usually does , " he added . the principle of a debt repayment freeze had been agreed upon last week by the group of seven industrialized nations and several of the 19-member paris club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister herve gaymard earlier in the day , french finance minister herve gaymard had said that other countries in southeast asia and east africa that suffered from the dec .
26 indian ocean tidal wave have " a lower level of indebtedness than the others and do not want their credit rating to be downgraded on international financial markets . " gaymard -lrb- photo -rrb- cited malaysia and thailand as examples . india , thailand do n't seek freeze india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions since accompanying conditions could make it harder or more expensive in the future to obtain credit on international financial markets . that has already happened in the past for indonesia , and two major credit rating agencies have warned jakarta that its sovereign rating could be affected if an evenutual debt restructuring were extended to private creditors such as banks .
but analysts say such a development is unlikely . indonesia nonetheless has a lot riding on obtaining debt relief .
its foreign debt comes to around $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100.7 billion -rrb- , and the country is looking at $ 3 billion in payments this year to service the obligation . bildunterschrift : these satellite images show an overview of southern banda aceh before and after the indian ocean tsunamis . only $ 70 billion of the total figure is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and therefore is eligible for the kind of debt relief that is being discussed . " operating space " foreign minister hasan wirayuda , in paris for the meeting , earlier told a joint news conference in london that indonesia sought " any schemes that would allow us operating space . " sri lanka 's foreign debt is roughly $ 7.7 billion . jean-francois cope , france 's budget minister , has described the actions taken by the paris club as a first step , which after a needs assessment by international financial bodies could lead to " complementary measures . " germany supports further relief germany and several other rich countries have already voiced support for deeper debt relief for countries devastated by the tidal wave , which killed at least 157,000 people . but gaymard has argued against lumping together discussions on easing all forms of debt .
for non-governmental organizations , re-scheduling and suspensions are far from sufficient , however . a rally was scheduled wednesday outside the french finance ministry , where the paris club is meeting , to demand that the debt of tsunami-hit countries be cancelled and that the united nations convene an international conference on the question . g-8 for international tax beyond the disaster in southeast asia , france - in upcoming meetings with its leading industrialized partners in the group of eight - wants to revive a proposal for an international tax to finance development aid , gaymard said . britain , current head of the group of eight , has recently called for a " new marshall plan " for the developing world in order to cancel an estimated $ 80 billion in debt owed by poor countries . the group of eight comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris club discusses debt relief the paris club creditor countries kick off a three-day meeting on wednesday to discuss relief measures for tsunami-struck south asian countries .

26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " schröder said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term .

several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "

he added that the plan singled out sri lanka and indonesia because they had borne the brunt of the tidal waves .
schröder also welcomed the idea of sponsorship programs for people orphaned in the disaster . before the meeting , schröder 's government agreed on setting up a working group made up of several ministries and representatives of states and local communities .
the group would be answerable to the foreign ministry and would handpick projects as well as prepare concrete aid . foreign minister joschka fischer , who returned from the disaster-hit region on wednesday , urged countries to take long-term action and not simply pay lip service to the tragedy while it was making headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in phuket , thailand .
it was " important to make something positive out of this disaster in the future , " and that partnerships were a good way to do so , he said at a press conference in berlin . " the right idea " many believe that schröder 's suggestion has been enthusiastically welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , last week called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.01.2005 paris club discusses debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt relief would be welcome help for rebuilding efforts in indonesia the paris club creditor countries kick off a three-day meeting on wednesday to discuss relief measures for tsunami-struck south asian countries .
the government creditors are set to agree on freezing debt repayments . many countries hit by the tsunami would be greatly helped by debt relief measures .
a moratorium on payments , for example , would mean that creditor nations would waive loan interest and repayments for a set period of time .
for some countries , creditors are even considering debt cancellation .
the government creditors in the paris club are set to agree wednesday on freezing debt repayments by sri lanka and indonesia .
the club has indicated that this could be just the first stage in aiding countries in the catastrophe region .
more substantial longer-term measures were also under consideration .
the club is an informal , voluntary gathering of 19 large western industrialized nations .
it co-ordinates solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor nations , reaching its decisions on debt relief by consensus .
debt repayment problems creditors are discussing postponing debt repayments by indonesia , sri lanka and somalia .
but india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions .
these countries have enough economic power to follow through with their financial commitments despite the catastrophe and the costs of rebuilding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation caused by the tsunami is even clearer from above however , the credit rating agency fitch warned earlier this week that countries benefiting from a debt repayment freeze might face problems when it expired .
they would then have to make regular payments in addition to the deferred ones .
the british government wants to persuade paris club members to go beyond a moratorium and approve debt cancellation .
but it is still unclear whether all state and state-guaranteed loans would be affected or only a portion .
french president jacques chirac has so far only endorsed a moratorium .
rodrigo rato , director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , supports a debt moratorium .
countries in the catastrophe region can therefore expect relief in their debts to the imf , too .
indonesia hopes for more in the case of indonesia , german foreign minister joschka fischer said more measures than a moratorium would be considered if it became necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer met with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in jakarta " to my knowledge , britain and the united states are also of this opinion , " said fischer following a meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono on tuesday -lrb- photo -rrb- .
indonesia has been hardest-hit by the catastrophe and is highly in debt .
economics minister aburizal bakrie said he expected western creditors to allow it to freeze $ 3.2 billion in debt repayments through 2006 to help it cope with the tsunami disaster .
" i hope that we can resume debt repayments in 2007 , " said aburizal .
however , debt relief measures would afflict germany 's budget .
development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has suggested debt cancellation for sri lanka , which owes foreign creditors some $ 7 billion .
the bilateral debts to germany from development and state-guaranteed loans total € 344 million .
if sri lanka 's debts were cancelled , this amount would be missing in germany 's budget at a time when berlin is struggling with a fiscal deficit and record borrowing . karl zawadzky / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un urges donors to keep promises the world has come through for south asia with big financial promises .

several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.01.2005 paris club discusses debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt relief would be welcome help for rebuilding efforts in indonesia the paris club creditor countries kick off a three-day meeting on wednesday to discuss relief measures for tsunami-struck south asian countries .
the government creditors are set to agree on freezing debt repayments . many countries hit by the tsunami would be greatly helped by debt relief measures .
a moratorium on payments , for example , would mean that creditor nations would waive loan interest and repayments for a set period of time .
for some countries , creditors are even considering debt cancellation .
the government creditors in the paris club are set to agree wednesday on freezing debt repayments by sri lanka and indonesia .
the club has indicated that this could be just the first stage in aiding countries in the catastrophe region .
more substantial longer-term measures were also under consideration .
the club is an informal , voluntary gathering of 19 large western industrialized nations .
it co-ordinates solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor nations , reaching its decisions on debt relief by consensus .
debt repayment problems creditors are discussing postponing debt repayments by indonesia , sri lanka and somalia .
but india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions .
these countries have enough economic power to follow through with their financial commitments despite the catastrophe and the costs of rebuilding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation caused by the tsunami is even clearer from above however , the credit rating agency fitch warned earlier this week that countries benefiting from a debt repayment freeze might face problems when it expired .
they would then have to make regular payments in addition to the deferred ones .
the british government wants to persuade paris club members to go beyond a moratorium and approve debt cancellation .
but it is still unclear whether all state and state-guaranteed loans would be affected or only a portion .
french president jacques chirac has so far only endorsed a moratorium .
rodrigo rato , director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , supports a debt moratorium .
countries in the catastrophe region can therefore expect relief in their debts to the imf , too .
indonesia hopes for more in the case of indonesia , german foreign minister joschka fischer said more measures than a moratorium would be considered if it became necessary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer met with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in jakarta " to my knowledge , britain and the united states are also of this opinion , " said fischer following a meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono on tuesday -lrb- photo -rrb- .
indonesia has been hardest-hit by the catastrophe and is highly in debt .
economics minister aburizal bakrie said he expected western creditors to allow it to freeze $ 3.2 billion in debt repayments through 2006 to help it cope with the tsunami disaster .
" i hope that we can resume debt repayments in 2007 , " said aburizal .
however , debt relief measures would afflict germany 's budget .

" after the attacks on new york , at the very latest , it became clear to everyone that there are gaps in the dialogue between the arab nations and the west , " hank said .
" that 's why deutsche welle is concentrating on the arabic language .
the online service is taking the lead , and we believe that the internet provides a good opportunity for to promote a dialog . " interactivity is key the online media 's interactivity makes it a good place to start , hank said .
" it offers people a natural forum to exchange ideas , and can flow in both directions .
that 's why arabic is an important language for us to publish in . " interactive elements online , such as polls or forums , are an important part of dw-world 's arabic site .
internet users will have the possiblitity to exchange ideas , with one another and with dw-world editors .
for instance , in addition to reporting on the iraqi elections on jan .

that 's why the humor rubric is important .
people can send in jokes , we 'll put them on the site , and readers can vote on them .
and we 'll send a gift to the person with the best joke . " whether through humor or hard facts , the internet has a huge potential in the arab world ; some 15 million people there have access to the world wide web .
most of them are young , and many are students .
thus deutsche welle will also concentrate on providing services , such as giving information on how and where to study in germany . the goal of all this , according to palestine-born editor shrouf , is the rapprochement of arabic and western culture . " i hope this website will reach a lot of people in the arabic and islamic world .

12 , 2005 dw-world 's arabic web site goes online .
to mark the event , the editors spoke to wolfgang thierse , president of the german parliament , about the much-vaunted dialogue between the west and the arab-islamic world . the interview comes at a time of intense debate in germany about the integration of foreigners living in the country and the compatibility of islam with european values . dw-world : germany has intensified efforts to maintain a dialogue with the arab world .
what has been achieved so far ? wolfgang thierse : firstly , contacts have been improved .
the dialogue between germany and europe and the arab-islamic world has gathered pace and intensified .
that 's valuable in itself , irrespective of the results . in which area do you think this dialogue should be concentrated ? the dialogue has to touch upon very different topics .
of course , politics is important .
germany and the arab world have a common interest in reaching a peaceful solution to the mideast conflict as well as seeing a stable democratic development in iraq and ensuring that tensions do n't escalate . secondly , the dialogue is also about economic exchange .
the middle east , saudi arabia and neighboring countries are very important to europe and germany on account of their crude oil and also as economic partners . thirdly , cultural exchange and religious dialogue is of equal importance .
here it 's important to overcome the feeling of " foreignness " and fighting prejudices . one can only do that if one gets to know each other better in order to not just recognize differences , but also similarities .
you ca n't do that via television or newspapers .
for that , you need to really talk to one another and look each other in the face . the west often plays teacher in the dialogue with the arab-islamic world .
how can germany take on a different role ? i 'm not sure that the west appears as a teacher .
on the other hand , there are some virulent accusations from the arab-islamic world against the west .
there 's also a kind of missionary zeal from a certain section of islam to convert the west to a life of godliness . on the other hand , the west says that peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths is a prerequisite for tolerance and for saying " yes " to religious pluralism .
but , in most islam-influenced countries there is no real religious freedom though it 's a condition for peace .
that 's the experience of the european continent that has waged wars , even religious ones , for centuries . that could only be ended through the principle of religious freedom and the separation of church and state .
it was a long and laborious process , but one that led to a positive outcome . in europe , people of different christian confessions and different religions live together in relative peace .
and now , one section of europeans is worrying that islamic citizens could disrupt this peace .
they 're worried for the sake of peace - i beg understanding for that . many people in the arab-islamic world hardly show interest in a dialogue with the west .
how can one still include them ? for one , you can give them the possibility of personally getting to know people from other cultures .
that 's the key to the opening of one 's own country .
after all , i can only develop interest for others if i have the chance to get to know someone or when i 'm motivated through the encounter to know more about them .
if i only hear about them through possibly superficial or one-sided television reports , then interest is n't stimulated . the reason why we 're developing a bigger interest in islam in germany has to do with the fact that several million citizens of islamic faith live here . does it suffice when there are contacts on an official level ? dialogue should never just take place on an official level .
it would be nice if europeans had the chance to travel to arab countries so that there would be contacts on a civil society level . it 's important that contacts are n't just forged in europe , but also in arab countries .
it 's important that the arab world opens up much more than is the case now and tries to overcome its own fear .
that 's a prerequisite for opening up : less fear .
the moment i open up and seek contact , the fear lessens .
but i do n't see that happening on a mass scale .
there are several arab countries , which expressly do n't open up .
they instead resist outside contact and that 's really not the kind of future project we 'd like . the main target group for dw-world 's arabic service is young people .
in many arab countries they have no training or jobs and there 's a danger they could be vulnerable to extremist ideas .
how can germany help ? it 's always the same topics : you need to engage in economic exchange in the interest of good economic development .
but it 's also important to contribute towards democratization in these countries through political and civil society contacts .
particularly in countries where there is n't any real social justice and where young people do n't have enough of a democratic voice . allowing democratization and liberalization processes is always also a challenge to arab governments too .
the processes are also important for economic interests because a closed society will in the end never be successful economically . there 's a lively discussion underway in germany on the integration of foreigners living in the country , in particular arabs and muslims . people are talking of a " multicultural society " and a " dominant culture .
what 's your position ? i stand between the two catchwords .
i do n't think either " dominant culture " or " multicultural society " is appropriate .
instead we need to make an effort towards intercultural understanding - that 's the correct term .
that means , firstly , that the germans should finally accept that 40 years ago not just labor but people came to their country .
the germans must also offer these people many more chances for integration and recognition . on the other hand , those who came to us , must be far more prepared to adapt to society here and say " yes " to it .
they must say " yes " to the fact that they are here and they and their children and grandchildren live here permanently . we should neither be allowed to make them " guest-workers " nor should they be allowed to define themselves that way .
such was the basic evil until now .
we lied to each other in the past 40 years .
what seemed at the beginning to be humanly understandable , has been a huge mistake for decades . and if we want to overcome it , then you need both sides - the so-called " dominant society " as well as the so-called " minority society " - to be even more prepared to engage with one another .
that 's necessary . it begins with learning the language and knowing the elementary rules of the constitution to the acknowledgement of cultural differences .
you do n't have to see the exchange as something threatening , but rather as highly-interesting and enriching . i still do n't know whether germany and europe will one day be a multicultural society .
there are still differences between the so-called " majority society " and the so-called " minority society . "
the balance of power is unequal .
in a multicultural society it would surely be distributed equally .
we 're still not there .
this is just a sober assessment , without passing judgment . interview by ibrahim mohamad -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over plan for german in mosques a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands .

they are part of the special unit kses , which quickly deploys medical service specialists to crisis regions .
in just a few days , a high-tech mobile field hospital will be operative in banda aceh .
the 40 soldiers pull up the tarpaulins between the mud left by the tidal wave .
when the unit has completed that , though , the real work begins .
" we want to mainly step in on short notice , " said senior field doctor thomas harbaum .
" this includes surgery , hygienic aid or helping with mobile troops to cover as many areas as possible . "
indonesia limits access to foreigners indonesia meanwhile asserted its military control over aceh on wednesday , requiring foreigners to register and seek official escorts to avoid what it said was a danger of rebel attacks . the move to lock down the jealously guarded region came as indonesia 's vice president yusuf kalla said foreign troops should leave aceh as soon as they finish their relief missions , staying no longer than three months . " in fact , the sooner the better , " kalla was quoted as saying . before the tsunami hit , indonesia had sealed off aceh to outsiders while it conducted a major military offensive to crush separatists engaged in a long-running independence struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cargo plane carrying relief supplies for the victims of the tsunami catastrophe at banda aceh airport after the devastation on dec .
26 , the region was thrown open , with thousands of foreign volunteers and troops rushing to bring humanitarian assistance . now authorities say foreign aid missions and journalists must register and be accompanied by the military if they travel outside main towns , while indonesian officers will be placed on foreign ships and planes . un officials understanding the un coordinator for aceh , joel boutroue , said he did not believe there was a threat from the rebels , adding that although his organization had no objection to the measures , it was clear security was not the only goal . " they want to have the situation under control for political reasons as well as security reasons , " he said .
" that 's understandable . " un secretary general kofi annan 's special humanitarian envoy , margareta wahlstrom , played down the impact of the restrictions . " i do n't see these as restrictions , " wahlstrom said , adding she did not think the regulations would impede the relief effort .
" they are not saying you can not go .
they are saying , let us know when you go . "
the challenge of coordination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of people in banda aceh have become homeless back in banda aceh , german lieutenant colonel walter huber schmidt said he is relieved to finally be on site and added that governments limiting access to foreigners was a well-known problem in similar crises .
" in the case of such catastrophes , it 's always a problem that the respective government has to approve the deployment , " schmidt said , adding that the men and women of kses needed another one or two days before being ready to start treating patients .
the second largest problem is the coordination of the many various aid organizations , he added .
" before the tidal wave , two to five airplanes landed at the small airport in banda aceh every day , " schmidt said .
" now , it 's 140 planes .
of course , this has to be coordinated and managed .
this can give the impression that everything is n't running that well . "
medical complications the rainy season has started in the aceh province .
three or four times a day , it buckets down .
while the soldiers get their equipment out of the rain , dredging machines at the banda aceh hospital dig the mud aside .
not a lot survived the flood , only destroyed equipment and beds .
the personnel is gone - dead or missing .
only one thing is certain : the need for help is still huge .
" even 14 days after the tsunami , we are still seeing a lot of surgical complications , such as infected wounds , " harbaum said .
" meanwhile , we 've already got over 20 cases of tetanus in the city .
that is a disease that is not easy to treat here . "
in addition , the doctor said he fears that malaria or dengue fever could develop .
already now , the number of diarrhea and respiratory problems in the homeless camps is growing .
trying to prevent worse colonel fritz wiggers , a doctor in the army reserve , is therefore trying to help already wherever he can .
he 's sitting in one of the many shelters , surrounded by numerous women , handing their children to him .
wiggers has tried to bring some order into the chaos , but he does n't have a lot of options .
he can give advice , though , and try to prevent worse .

" it is an offer by the paris club that has not yet been formally accepted by the countries concerned : sri lanka , indonesia , and the seychelles , " club president jean-pierre joyuet -lrb- photo -rrb- told a press conference in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris club chairman jean pierre jouyet on wednesday " this offer is not tied to any conditions , neither an accord with the imf -lrb- international monetary fund -rrb- , nor to comparable treatment by private creditors as the paris club usually does , " he added . the principle of a debt repayment freeze had been agreed upon last week by the group of seven industrialized nations and several of the 19-member paris club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister herve gaymard earlier in the day , french finance minister herve gaymard had said that other countries in southeast asia and east africa that suffered from the dec .
26 indian ocean tidal wave have " a lower level of indebtedness than the others and do not want their credit rating to be downgraded on international financial markets . " gaymard -lrb- photo -rrb- cited malaysia and thailand as examples . india , thailand do n't seek freeze india and thailand have indicated they would not seek repayment suspensions since accompanying conditions could make it harder or more expensive in the future to obtain credit on international financial markets . that has already happened in the past for indonesia , and two major credit rating agencies have warned jakarta that its sovereign rating could be affected if an evenutual debt restructuring were extended to private creditors such as banks .
but analysts say such a development is unlikely . indonesia nonetheless has a lot riding on obtaining debt relief .
its foreign debt comes to around $ 132 billion -lrb- € 100.7 billion -rrb- , and the country is looking at $ 3 billion in payments this year to service the obligation . bildunterschrift : these satellite images show an overview of southern banda aceh before and after the indian ocean tsunamis . only $ 70 billion of the total figure is owed to public creditors or has been guaranteed by public bodies and therefore is eligible for the kind of debt relief that is being discussed . " operating space " foreign minister hasan wirayuda , in paris for the meeting , earlier told a joint news conference in london that indonesia sought " any schemes that would allow us operating space . " sri lanka 's foreign debt is roughly $ 7.7 billion . jean-francois cope , france 's budget minister , has described the actions taken by the paris club as a first step , which after a needs assessment by international financial bodies could lead to " complementary measures . " germany supports further relief germany and several other rich countries have already voiced support for deeper debt relief for countries devastated by the tidal wave , which killed at least 157,000 people . but gaymard has argued against lumping together discussions on easing all forms of debt .
for non-governmental organizations , re-scheduling and suspensions are far from sufficient , however . a rally was scheduled wednesday outside the french finance ministry , where the paris club is meeting , to demand that the debt of tsunami-hit countries be cancelled and that the united nations convene an international conference on the question . g-8 for international tax beyond the disaster in southeast asia , france - in upcoming meetings with its leading industrialized partners in the group of eight - wants to revive a proposal for an international tax to finance development aid , gaymard said . britain , current head of the group of eight , has recently called for a " new marshall plan " for the developing world in order to cancel an estimated $ 80 billion in debt owed by poor countries . the group of eight comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris club discusses debt relief the paris club creditor countries kick off a three-day meeting on wednesday to discuss relief measures for tsunami-struck south asian countries .

26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " schröder said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " on wednesday , the plan found enthusiastic takers at a meeting in berlin between the chancellor and representatives from germany 's 16 states and local governments .
several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "
at the same time the chancellor stressed that aid , however important and effective , " could not afford to be just an emergency measure , but had to be sustainable and long-term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents walk past by debris in the town of meulaboh , aceh province , indonesia .
he added that the plan singled out sri lanka and indonesia because they had borne the brunt of the tidal waves .
schröder also welcomed the idea of sponsorship programs for people orphaned in the disaster . before the meeting , schröder 's government agreed on setting up a working group made up of several ministries and representatives of states and local communities .
the group would be answerable to the foreign ministry and would handpick projects as well as prepare concrete aid . foreign minister joschka fischer , who returned from the disaster-hit region on wednesday , urged countries to take long-term action and not simply pay lip service to the tragedy while it was making headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in phuket , thailand .
it was " important to make something positive out of this disaster in the future , " and that partnerships were a good way to do so , he said at a press conference in berlin . " the right idea " many believe that schröder 's suggestion has been enthusiastically welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , last week called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " the proposal also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women quench their thirst from distributed safe water packets in tamil nadu the idea has also sparked interest among german cities . the former capital of bonn plans - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - to set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .

dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family . germany 's declining birth rate - just one child is born in the country for every four adults in germany - is often blamed on everything from the poor state of the economy , unemployment , job security to dwindling pension coffers . but a new study commissioned by the magazines eltern -lrb- parents -rrb- and eltern for family has uncovered some rather different reasons for germans shying away from starting a family . it found that three-quarters of the 40,000 men and women questioned wished german society was more child-friendly .
" having kids not sexy anymore " " germany is so hostile towards children that even people without children have noticed , " said marie-luise lewicki , eltern 's editor-in-chief at the study 's presentation on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindergarten children in germany " it is n't sexy to have children in germany , " said lewicki .
" that 's why we do n't only need better daycare and full-day schooling for families , but above all a departure from this kind of thinking in society . "
many germans therefore have chosen to forego their longing to have a family altogether .
welcoming children into society families must be given the feeling that they are welcome in germany with their children , lewicki said .
the study found that while 80 percent of parents found understanding and support in their private lives , publicly the opposite is the case .
half of those surveyed said children were considered bothersome in stores or restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same , apparently , is the case at the workplace , the study found . many bosses show lack of understanding when it comes to working overtime .
for 42 percent of mothers , children are simply " career killers . "
academics in particular feel children put them at a disadvantage in their profession .
more state support needed in addition , 37 percent said it 's more difficult to find a place to live with a family than without .
three-quarters of parents said they wished there were more recognition for raising a family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both families with children , as well as childless men and women said they wished there was more state support , even for encouraging mothers to go back to work after having a child .
malte ristau from the federal ministry for family affairs said , however , that family policies had been " delegated to the state " for too long .
ristau called for more responsibility by companies , for example with flexible working hours or childcare possibilities .
44 percent of childless respondents also said they were missing a suitable partner to start a family .
every third person surveyed expressed concern about his or her job .
family still number one the number of births in germany has been cut in half over the past 40 years .
in 1964 , close to 1.4 million children were born in east and west germany .
four decades later , this figure has sunk to 706,000 .
still , family does play a major role for germans .
a total of 89 percent of those questioned said family was the most important part of their lives .

26 , 2004 , killing almost 160,000 people including many children and a number of foreign tourists . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation - germany included , " schröder said in his annual new year 's address earlier this month , adding that states , municipalities and villages should do so with corresponding entities as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the chancellor stressed the importance of long-term aid .

" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " on wednesday , the plan found enthusiastic takers at a meeting in berlin between the chancellor and representatives from germany 's 16 states and local governments .
several cities said they were prepared to strike partnerships with tsunami-affected towns and cities , particularly in indonesia and sri lanka .
the first are expected to be officially sealed over the next few days . long-term aid schröder said the meeting had finalized conditions " to organize and channel german aid . "

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents walk past by debris in the town of meulaboh , aceh province , indonesia .
he added that the plan singled out sri lanka and indonesia because they had borne the brunt of the tidal waves .
schröder also welcomed the idea of sponsorship programs for people orphaned in the disaster . before the meeting , schröder 's government agreed on setting up a working group made up of several ministries and representatives of states and local communities .
the group would be answerable to the foreign ministry and would handpick projects as well as prepare concrete aid . foreign minister joschka fischer , who returned from the disaster-hit region on wednesday , urged countries to take long-term action and not simply pay lip service to the tragedy while it was making headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in phuket , thailand .
it was " important to make something positive out of this disaster in the future , " and that partnerships were a good way to do so , he said at a press conference in berlin . " the right idea " many believe that schröder 's suggestion has been enthusiastically welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .

" the proposal also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .

" we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations .

' not a threat , but a resource ' " we should encourage a positive attitude towards economic migrants , " he said .
" we should consider them not as a threat but as a possible resource . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-immigration parties like jean-marie le pen 's front nationale , in france , have an increasingly strong following in europe europe needs to attract legal migrants to help boost economic growth and counter the effects of an aging population , frattini said on tuesday .
but the countries opposed to the suggestions – germany and austria strongly among them - argue immigration quotas can only be decided by national governments .
this principle is laid out in the new european constitution , they say . nevertheless , frattini went ahead with his attempt to convince member states to at least discuss a common policy .
while governments would retain their national right to set immigration quotas , the overall european approach could still be made more coherent , he said . seeking debate speaking in brussels on tuesday , he promised an open debate with eu member states , lawmakers , citizens and industry before proposing a draft law on legal migration towards the end of 2005 . " it is decisive , in an expanded european union , that we clarify the immigration regulations – and that we do it in the near future .
potential immigrants should know which rights and responsibilities they have , which possibilities and which limitations there are for economic migrants within the eu , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of german cities have become more multicultural on tuesday , frattini presented a discussion paper , called a green book , which outlines different immigration models .
despite opposition from anti-immigration parties in various countries , one possibility consider would be a quota system like in the united states , frattini said . " one of the options that the commission will have to decide on is an american-style greencard system , " he said . need for workers brussels argues that legal immigration is needed to boost economic growth in europe in the long run .
ageing populations all over europe will not produce enough workers , frattini said . the european union projects that by 2030 , the eu work force will fall by 20 million , leaving a gap in skilled workers . the strategy of filling this gap with economic migrants might be hard to swallow for europe 's unemployed , with joblessness in the 25 nation block at around 10 percent .
but frattini noted that migrants " usually take jobs that no one wants , or that fill gaps in education and skills . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boatload of illegal immigrants from africa , on the coast of spain the commissioner also noted that by giving migrants the opportunity to legally enter the european union , it might prevent desperate migrants from boarding ships in north africa to reach the shores of italy or spain . " without a unified european approach , we risk having an even greater number of illegal immigrants .
these people then ca n't be integrated , and stay on the margins of society .
personally , i would find that to be a completely unacceptable development . " while he hopes to get the reluctant council of european ministers to agree on a common strategy by the end of the year , frattini said he is aware that his predecessor had failed to reach a consensus on the sensitive issue for the past five years . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family . germany 's declining birth rate - just one child is born in the country for every four adults in germany - is often blamed on everything from the poor state of the economy , unemployment , job security to dwindling pension coffers . but a new study commissioned by the magazines eltern -lrb- parents -rrb- and eltern for family has uncovered some rather different reasons for germans shying away from starting a family . it found that three-quarters of the 40,000 men and women questioned wished german society was more child-friendly .
" having kids not sexy anymore " " germany is so hostile towards children that even people without children have noticed , " said marie-luise lewicki , eltern 's editor-in-chief at the study 's presentation on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindergarten children in germany " it is n't sexy to have children in germany , " said lewicki .
" that 's why we do n't only need better daycare and full-day schooling for families , but above all a departure from this kind of thinking in society . "
many germans therefore have chosen to forego their longing to have a family altogether .
welcoming children into society families must be given the feeling that they are welcome in germany with their children , lewicki said .
the study found that while 80 percent of parents found understanding and support in their private lives , publicly the opposite is the case .
half of those surveyed said children were considered bothersome in stores or restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same , apparently , is the case at the workplace , the study found . many bosses show lack of understanding when it comes to working overtime .
for 42 percent of mothers , children are simply " career killers . "
academics in particular feel children put them at a disadvantage in their profession .
more state support needed in addition , 37 percent said it 's more difficult to find a place to live with a family than without .
three-quarters of parents said they wished there were more recognition for raising a family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both families with children , as well as childless men and women said they wished there was more state support , even for encouraging mothers to go back to work after having a child .
malte ristau from the federal ministry for family affairs said , however , that family policies had been " delegated to the state " for too long .
ristau called for more responsibility by companies , for example with flexible working hours or childcare possibilities .
44 percent of childless respondents also said they were missing a suitable partner to start a family .
every third person surveyed expressed concern about his or her job .
family still number one the number of births in germany has been cut in half over the past 40 years .
in 1964 , close to 1.4 million children were born in east and west germany .
four decades later , this figure has sunk to 706,000 .
still , family does play a major role for germans .
a total of 89 percent of those questioned said family was the most important part of their lives .
their careers came in second - with six percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : childcare study shows : east beats west a european study on german daycare praised the eastern part of the country and criticized the west for its meager offerings for preschoolers .

genewatch uk said both communist and fascist governments in europe had used personal records to oppress people .
changes could be made to safeguard privacy without compromising the use of dna in fighting crime , its report said .
the home office said measures were in place to restrict use of the database to crime probes and prosecutions .
but genewatch argued the database creates a permanent list of " suspects " which includes anyone arrested for a recordable offence even if they are never charged .
independent body call the organisation urged the creation of an independent body to oversee the database .
and it called for people 's dna samples to be destroyed on completion of an investigation .
expanding the database to include the whole population would give the potential to create a " future police state " .
spokeswoman dr helen wallace said : " controls on the database must be tightened to prevent a big brother state .
important changes ?
" within living memory , both fascist and communist governments in europe have used personal records as a means of oppressing different populations .
" there are important changes that can be made to safeguard privacy and rights without compromising the use of dna in fighting crime . "
a home office spokeswoman said careful consideration would be given to genewatch 's report but there were no plans to introduce a universal dna database or widen access for commercial reasons .
she added : " the national dna database has proved to be an extremely effective tool in the fight against crime . "
legal scrutiny had already been given to rules that allowed the retention of dna samples and profiles to be taken from people who had been arrested but not convicted , she added .
genewatch uk describes itself as " a not-for-profit group that monitors developments in genetic technologies from a public interest , environmental protection and animal welfare perspective " .

china 's proposal came after meetings with taiwanese opposition politicians .
taiwan has invested $ 100bn in china in recent years , but the countries ' governments refuse to talk , and direct air links have been banned since 1949 .
the chinese proposal , branded a " one-off " , would allow flights between taipei and four cities on the mainland .
but china ruled out opening official talks with the government in taipei to discuss permanent aviation links , branding the suggestion " inappropriate " .
an official in china 's taiwan affairs office , he shizhong , said he hoped taiwan would agree to allow flights between taipei and shanghai , beijing , guangzhou and xiamen .
we 've had enough , let 's have direct flights !
china evening times taiwan media reaction " we hope to realise the direct charter flights in the coming spring festival in order to meet the need of taiwanese businessmen and taiwan compatriots , " , mr he said .
" if taiwan shows sincerity on the issue , it will not be a problem to realise direct flights this year . "
attempts to run direct flights have faltered in the past , notably in 2003 , when charter planes were forced to divert to hong kong and macau in order not to travel directly between china and taiwan .
the plan needs the approval of taiwan 's president , chen shui-bian .
china 's rulers prefer to deal with opposition politicians who do not support formal independence for the island of 23 million .

china evening times taiwan media reaction " we hope to realise the direct charter flights in the coming spring festival in order to meet the need of taiwanese businessmen and taiwan compatriots , " , mr he said .
" if taiwan shows sincerity on the issue , it will not be a problem to realise direct flights this year . "

the plan needs the approval of taiwan 's president , chen shui-bian .
china 's rulers prefer to deal with opposition politicians who do not support formal independence for the island of 23 million .

however , sufficient people came after christmas to make the visit of cirque eloize from montreal a profitable one .
the huge stage is now converted to an ice rink for sleeping beauty on ice , which opens on wednesday .
the main stage at wmc is very cold at the moment .
no fewer than 15 tons of ice now flow over its surface which has been transformed to accommodate sleeping beauty on ice .
tony mercer , the artistic director , explained : " we had to go out locally to buy five tons of ice to make a quick start in building the ice rink .
" our engineers then spent some 15 hours spraying until the ice was three inches deep , so it 's now 15 tons of ice - a huge undertaking . "
it is the second show in the centre 's opening season , which has not been without its difficulties .
marketing an art form such as modern circus - which is unfamiliar to many people - did prove difficult .
having cancelled two matinee shows of cirque eloize 's rain in the week leading up to christmas , wales millennium centre audiences only started picking up in the period leading up to the new year .
sales then improved hugely , mainly as result of word-of mouth , which resulted in a total of over 30,000 people turning up during the month-long run .
judith isherwood , wmc chief executive , admits they did not hit their own targets .
" we budgeted relatively low in terms of audience figures and we have n't quite hit what we wanted but we 've hit close enough to do well out of the season , " she said .
the montreal-based circus company was pleased by the enthusiasm of welsh audiences and were particularly impressed by the venue itself , as general manager sonya st-martin explained .
" i think you have a very nice home for the arts - it 's really gorgeous , pretty big and comfortable for the artists because the stage is so large and the technical help is fantastic , " she said .
tickets for the spectacle of an energetic troupe of russian skaters in sleeping beauty are selling well as the welsh audience begins to develop a real taste for international acts .
