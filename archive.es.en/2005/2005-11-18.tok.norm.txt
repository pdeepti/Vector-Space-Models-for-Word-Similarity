a spokesman for the public prosecutors office said irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty . the right-wing historian was apparently on his way to a students ' club in vienna when he was stopped , austria 's apa agency said .
such clubs are often linked to far-right or pan-germanic movements . far-right activism the 67-year-old british born historian has been active in far right circles since the 1960 's , gaining worldwide notoreity for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that adolf hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was wildly exaggerated . he made his name with a book about the allied air raids on dresden and biographies of general erwin rommel and the nazi deputy leader rudolph hess .
in " hitler 's war , " he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings until 1943 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt leaving court in 2000 five years ago he was involved in a high profile court case in which he sued the american author deborah lipstadt for accusing him of holocaust denial .
he lost the case . international bans this is the second time austrian police have arrested david irving . on the first occasion in 1984 he was deported to germany .
for now he is likely to remain in investigative custody for at least a week while prosecutors investigate whether they can proceed on an arrest warrant served so many years after the alleged offense was committed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , where denying the holocaust is a crime , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand . he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . kerry skyring -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg 's legacy lives on in struggle for international justice the nuremberg trials of 22 nazi leaders opened on nov .

20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .

a spokesman for the public prosecutors office said irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty . the right-wing historian was apparently on his way to a students ' club in vienna when he was stopped , austria 's apa agency said .
such clubs are often linked to far-right or pan-germanic movements . far-right activism the 67-year-old british born historian has been active in far right circles since the 1960 's , gaining worldwide notoreity for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that adolf hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was wildly exaggerated . he made his name with a book about the allied air raids on dresden and biographies of general erwin rommel and the nazi deputy leader rudolph hess .
in " hitler 's war , " he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings until 1943 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt leaving court in 2000 five years ago he was involved in a high profile court case in which he sued the american author deborah lipstadt for accusing him of holocaust denial .
he lost the case . international bans this is the second time austrian police have arrested david irving . on the first occasion in 1984 he was deported to germany .
for now he is likely to remain in investigative custody for at least a week while prosecutors investigate whether they can proceed on an arrest warrant served so many years after the alleged offense was committed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , where denying the holocaust is a crime , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand . he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . kerry skyring -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg 's legacy lives on in struggle for international justice the nuremberg trials of 22 nazi leaders opened on nov .

20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .
otherwise , it is difficult to see how they can ask us to fight terrorism with civilized means , but not allow international jurisdiction to fight against crimes committed by terrorists .

sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused .

it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .

beginning next year , it will be split into two parts . german semi-conductors giant infineon reported losses friday , a day after their board approved plans to spin off the company 's loss-making chip business into its own company . infineon said in a statement that it booked net loss of 312 million euros -lrb- $ 365 million -rrb- in the 12 months to september , compared with profit of 61 million euros a year earlier .
in the fourth quarter alone , the chip-maker was also back in the red , booking bottom-line loss of 100 million euros , compared with a profit of 44 million euros a year earlier . nevertheless , the fourth-quarter loss was narrower than the loss of 240 million euros recorded in the third quarter .
on an annual basis , underlying earnings also deteriorated , with infineon running up full-year operating loss of 182 million euros compared with a year-earlier profit of 256 million euros . full-year sales were down 6 percent at 6.759 billion euros .
in the fourth quarter alone , the operating loss stood at 43 million euros , an improvement on the third-quarter loss of 234 million euros . falli n g dema n d , restructuri n g to blame " the narrower loss is primarily attributable to slightly higher sales prices and a strong reduction in costs in the memory products segment , " said chairman wolfgang zeibart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang ziebart it was the strong competition in the chip market that pushed infineon to decide to spin-off its memory chip segment .
the company reported only 61 million euros in profit on 7.2 billion euros in sales in 2004 .
initially , the memory products business would be made into a legally independent entity by july 1 , 2006 and after that infineon would consider floating it on the stock exchange .
the spin-off will help the company concentrate instead on its logic activities in sectors such as the automotive and communications , industrial electronics industries . in addition , third-quarter earnings had been hit by one-off charges " connected with the planned phase-out of production at the group 's plant in munich-perlach , " the company explained .
the planned closure was met with protests by the striking wokers at the end of october .
more than 800 are expected to lose their jobs . infineon attributed the decline in full-year sales to " falling demand from some customers for mobile phone components and continued pricing pressure in all operating segments .

more than 800 will lose their jobs infineon had announced thursday that it intended to spin off the activities into a legally independent unit next year with a view to a possible stock market flotation . in the logic products division , operating profit from the automotive , industrial and multimarket business fell by 47 percent to 134 million euros on a full-basis and sales slipped by one percent to 2.516 billion euros . i n vestors looki n g forward the communications business saw its operating loss widen to 295 million euros from 44 million euros a year earlier and sales decline by 18 percent to 1.391 billion euros . looking ahead , infineon said it was targeting sales growth at least equal to the market as a whole .
zeibart declined to make any earnings forecast . investors appeared to believe that the numbers were not as bad as feared and infineon shares were showing a gain of 1.13 percent at 8.04 euros in mid-morning trade on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon 's troubles keep growing infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .

in italy last week , the milan public prosecutor demanded the extradition of 22 cia agents believed to have been involved in the abduction of omar , the subject of an italian anti-terrorist investigation .

beginning next year , it will be split into two parts . german semi-conductors giant infineon reported losses friday , a day after their board approved plans to spin off the company 's loss-making chip business into its own company . infineon said in a statement that it booked net loss of 312 million euros -lrb- $ 365 million -rrb- in the 12 months to september , compared with profit of 61 million euros a year earlier .
in the fourth quarter alone , the chip-maker was also back in the red , booking bottom-line loss of 100 million euros , compared with a profit of 44 million euros a year earlier . nevertheless , the fourth-quarter loss was narrower than the loss of 240 million euros recorded in the third quarter .
on an annual basis , underlying earnings also deteriorated , with infineon running up full-year operating loss of 182 million euros compared with a year-earlier profit of 256 million euros . full-year sales were down 6 percent at 6.759 billion euros .
in the fourth quarter alone , the operating loss stood at 43 million euros , an improvement on the third-quarter loss of 234 million euros . falli n g dema n d , restructuri n g to blame " the narrower loss is primarily attributable to slightly higher sales prices and a strong reduction in costs in the memory products segment , " said chairman wolfgang zeibart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang ziebart it was the strong competition in the chip market that pushed infineon to decide to spin-off its memory chip segment .
the company reported only 61 million euros in profit on 7.2 billion euros in sales in 2004 .
initially , the memory products business would be made into a legally independent entity by july 1 , 2006 and after that infineon would consider floating it on the stock exchange .
the spin-off will help the company concentrate instead on its logic activities in sectors such as the automotive and communications , industrial electronics industries . in addition , third-quarter earnings had been hit by one-off charges " connected with the planned phase-out of production at the group 's plant in munich-perlach , " the company explained .
the planned closure was met with protests by the striking wokers at the end of october .
more than 800 are expected to lose their jobs . infineon attributed the decline in full-year sales to " falling demand from some customers for mobile phone components and continued pricing pressure in all operating segments .

more than 800 will lose their jobs infineon had announced thursday that it intended to spin off the activities into a legally independent unit next year with a view to a possible stock market flotation . in the logic products division , operating profit from the automotive , industrial and multimarket business fell by 47 percent to 134 million euros on a full-basis and sales slipped by one percent to 2.516 billion euros . i n vestors looki n g forward the communications business saw its operating loss widen to 295 million euros from 44 million euros a year earlier and sales decline by 18 percent to 1.391 billion euros . looking ahead , infineon said it was targeting sales growth at least equal to the market as a whole .
zeibart declined to make any earnings forecast . investors appeared to believe that the numbers were not as bad as feared and infineon shares were showing a gain of 1.13 percent at 8.04 euros in mid-morning trade on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon 's troubles keep growing infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .

20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .
otherwise , it is difficult to see how they can ask us to fight terrorism with civilized means , but not allow international jurisdiction to fight against crimes committed by terrorists .

beginning next year , it will be split into two parts . german semi-conductors giant infineon reported losses friday , a day after their board approved plans to spin off the company 's loss-making chip business into its own company . infineon said in a statement that it booked net loss of 312 million euros -lrb- $ 365 million -rrb- in the 12 months to september , compared with profit of 61 million euros a year earlier .
in the fourth quarter alone , the chip-maker was also back in the red , booking bottom-line loss of 100 million euros , compared with a profit of 44 million euros a year earlier . nevertheless , the fourth-quarter loss was narrower than the loss of 240 million euros recorded in the third quarter .
on an annual basis , underlying earnings also deteriorated , with infineon running up full-year operating loss of 182 million euros compared with a year-earlier profit of 256 million euros . full-year sales were down 6 percent at 6.759 billion euros .
in the fourth quarter alone , the operating loss stood at 43 million euros , an improvement on the third-quarter loss of 234 million euros . falli n g dema n d , restructuri n g to blame " the narrower loss is primarily attributable to slightly higher sales prices and a strong reduction in costs in the memory products segment , " said chairman wolfgang zeibart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang ziebart it was the strong competition in the chip market that pushed infineon to decide to spin-off its memory chip segment .
the company reported only 61 million euros in profit on 7.2 billion euros in sales in 2004 .
initially , the memory products business would be made into a legally independent entity by july 1 , 2006 and after that infineon would consider floating it on the stock exchange .
the spin-off will help the company concentrate instead on its logic activities in sectors such as the automotive and communications , industrial electronics industries . in addition , third-quarter earnings had been hit by one-off charges " connected with the planned phase-out of production at the group 's plant in munich-perlach , " the company explained .
the planned closure was met with protests by the striking wokers at the end of october .
more than 800 are expected to lose their jobs . infineon attributed the decline in full-year sales to " falling demand from some customers for mobile phone components and continued pricing pressure in all operating segments . " memory products busi n ess stro n g by division , the memory products business turned in operating profit of 34 million euros in the fourth quarter , compared with a loss of 149 million euros in the preceding three months .
on a full-year basis , however , the division saw operating profit fall by 28 percent to 122 million euros on a three-percent drop in sales to 2.826 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking workers at the plant at the end of october .
more than 800 will lose their jobs infineon had announced thursday that it intended to spin off the activities into a legally independent unit next year with a view to a possible stock market flotation . in the logic products division , operating profit from the automotive , industrial and multimarket business fell by 47 percent to 134 million euros on a full-basis and sales slipped by one percent to 2.516 billion euros . i n vestors looki n g forward the communications business saw its operating loss widen to 295 million euros from 44 million euros a year earlier and sales decline by 18 percent to 1.391 billion euros . looking ahead , infineon said it was targeting sales growth at least equal to the market as a whole .
zeibart declined to make any earnings forecast . investors appeared to believe that the numbers were not as bad as feared and infineon shares were showing a gain of 1.13 percent at 8.04 euros in mid-morning trade on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon 's troubles keep growing infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .

germany has been named as a stopping off point for planes that allegedly transported terror suspects to secret cia prisons in european countries .
the government has no plans to investigate .
the opposition says it should . germany will instead wait until it gets the results of an investigation by the public prosecutor in the town of zweibrücken , a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry told the berli n er zeitu n g daily . the zweibrücken public prosecutor is examining the february 2003 kidnapping in italy by cia agents of hassan mustafa osama nasr , also known as abu omar , a former imam who was allegedly brought to the us military base at ramstein in southwestern germany prior to his being taken to his native country , egypt .
in italy last week , the milan public prosecutor demanded the extradition of 22 cia agents believed to have been involved in the abduction of omar , the subject of an italian anti-terrorist investigation . " the foreign minister should have a talk with the us ambassador , " top free democratic party politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the berli n er zeitu n g .
" if the so far unproven accusations are correct , it would be outrageous , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said . green party military expert winfried nachtwei also said the german government should talk to the americans , and find out what happened .

us-based independent watchdog human rights watch said it was " practically convinced " that such detention centers , so-called black sites , existed . in another case , munich public prosecutors are investigating the alleged kidnapping of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri .
he says americans were involved in his kidnapping on dec .
31 , 2003 on the serbian-macedonian border .
he claims he was held prisoner in a macedonian hotel for 23 days , after which he was flown to a jail in afghanistan and accused of being a member of al qaeda .
he was only taken back to europe following months of interrogation , he says .
as the scandal develops and the public outcry in europe mounts , the onus will be on european leaders , rather than washington officials , to explain themselves to their constituencies and to the european union , jeremy shapiro , research director at the brookings institution 's center on the united states and europe and an expert on military and national security issues , told afp . " this is likely to be a test for the eu , " shapiro said .
" i do n't think it 's going to be a huge problem for the us government or for transatlantic relations , but it is going to be perhaps a domestic issue in some of these countries and perhaps an intra-european issue in calling into question just what being a member of the eu allows you to do and not do .

beginning next year , it will be split into two parts . german semi-conductors giant infineon reported losses friday , a day after their board approved plans to spin off the company 's loss-making chip business into its own company . infineon said in a statement that it booked net loss of 312 million euros -lrb- $ 365 million -rrb- in the 12 months to september , compared with profit of 61 million euros a year earlier .
in the fourth quarter alone , the chip-maker was also back in the red , booking bottom-line loss of 100 million euros , compared with a profit of 44 million euros a year earlier . nevertheless , the fourth-quarter loss was narrower than the loss of 240 million euros recorded in the third quarter .
on an annual basis , underlying earnings also deteriorated , with infineon running up full-year operating loss of 182 million euros compared with a year-earlier profit of 256 million euros . full-year sales were down 6 percent at 6.759 billion euros .
in the fourth quarter alone , the operating loss stood at 43 million euros , an improvement on the third-quarter loss of 234 million euros . falli n g dema n d , restructuri n g to blame " the narrower loss is primarily attributable to slightly higher sales prices and a strong reduction in costs in the memory products segment , " said chairman wolfgang zeibart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang ziebart it was the strong competition in the chip market that pushed infineon to decide to spin-off its memory chip segment .
the company reported only 61 million euros in profit on 7.2 billion euros in sales in 2004 .
initially , the memory products business would be made into a legally independent entity by july 1 , 2006 and after that infineon would consider floating it on the stock exchange .
the spin-off will help the company concentrate instead on its logic activities in sectors such as the automotive and communications , industrial electronics industries . in addition , third-quarter earnings had been hit by one-off charges " connected with the planned phase-out of production at the group 's plant in munich-perlach , " the company explained .
the planned closure was met with protests by the striking wokers at the end of october .
more than 800 are expected to lose their jobs . infineon attributed the decline in full-year sales to " falling demand from some customers for mobile phone components and continued pricing pressure in all operating segments . " memory products busi n ess stro n g by division , the memory products business turned in operating profit of 34 million euros in the fourth quarter , compared with a loss of 149 million euros in the preceding three months .
on a full-year basis , however , the division saw operating profit fall by 28 percent to 122 million euros on a three-percent drop in sales to 2.826 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking workers at the plant at the end of october .
more than 800 will lose their jobs infineon had announced thursday that it intended to spin off the activities into a legally independent unit next year with a view to a possible stock market flotation . in the logic products division , operating profit from the automotive , industrial and multimarket business fell by 47 percent to 134 million euros on a full-basis and sales slipped by one percent to 2.516 billion euros . i n vestors looki n g forward the communications business saw its operating loss widen to 295 million euros from 44 million euros a year earlier and sales decline by 18 percent to 1.391 billion euros . looking ahead , infineon said it was targeting sales growth at least equal to the market as a whole .
zeibart declined to make any earnings forecast . investors appeared to believe that the numbers were not as bad as feared and infineon shares were showing a gain of 1.13 percent at 8.04 euros in mid-morning trade on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon 's troubles keep growing infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .
the financial bad news comes on the heels of a corruption scandal .

20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .
otherwise , it is difficult to see how they can ask us to fight terrorism with civilized means , but not allow international jurisdiction to fight against crimes committed by terrorists .

her christian democrats have opposed turkey 's bid to join the european union , calling instead for a " privileged partnership " with the predominantly muslim nation which started accession talks on oct .
4 . that stance angered germany 's three million-strong turkish community and raised concerns about berlin 's future relations with ankara . differences over turkey prompt compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and spd have different views on turkey joining the eu but the christian democrats and their coalition partners , the social democrats - who strongly back turkey 's bid for membership - reached a compromise on the issue last week .
the parties said they recognized the eu 's stance that turkey " will have no prior guarantees about the outcome " of the accession talks which are expected to last up to 15 years . the term " privileged partnership " has been dropped in favor of " privileged relationship , " but the government manifesto stresses this would only be the case if turkey fails to meet the criteria for full membership . gül was also scheduled to meet with outgoing german foreign minister joschka fischer and with his successor frank-walter steinmeier on friday . ankara waits to see if relations remain warm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder enjoyed a warm relationship ankara enjoyed warm relations with outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , who visited erdogan in the wake of the german elections in one of a handful of trips abroad to say farewell to fellow leaders . schröder has repeatedly said turkey 's bid to join the eu will be successful and worked to ensure harmonious ties between germans and turkish immigrants .
he has argued along with fischer that integrating the populous , relatively poor nation into europe would prove vital towards ensuring the region 's safety in a climate of growing islamic extremism . gül was also to attend a conference organized by a foundation that promotes links between business and politics . merkel is due to be voted in by parliament next tuesday , becoming the first woman chancellor in german history . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey bids schröder a fond farewell german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .

germany has been named as a stopping off point for planes that allegedly transported terror suspects to secret cia prisons in european countries .
the government has no plans to investigate .
the opposition says it should . germany will instead wait until it gets the results of an investigation by the public prosecutor in the town of zweibrücken , a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry told the berli n er zeitu n g daily . the zweibrücken public prosecutor is examining the february 2003 kidnapping in italy by cia agents of hassan mustafa osama nasr , also known as abu omar , a former imam who was allegedly brought to the us military base at ramstein in southwestern germany prior to his being taken to his native country , egypt .
in italy last week , the milan public prosecutor demanded the extradition of 22 cia agents believed to have been involved in the abduction of omar , the subject of an italian anti-terrorist investigation . " the foreign minister should have a talk with the us ambassador , " top free democratic party politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the berli n er zeitu n g .
" if the so far unproven accusations are correct , it would be outrageous , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said . green party military expert winfried nachtwei also said the german government should talk to the americans , and find out what happened .
if the allegations were indeed true , they would be " highly alarming . "

11 , 2001 attacks .
us-based independent watchdog human rights watch said it was " practically convinced " that such detention centers , so-called black sites , existed . in another case , munich public prosecutors are investigating the alleged kidnapping of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri .
he says americans were involved in his kidnapping on dec .
31 , 2003 on the serbian-macedonian border .
he claims he was held prisoner in a macedonian hotel for 23 days , after which he was flown to a jail in afghanistan and accused of being a member of al qaeda .
he was only taken back to europe following months of interrogation , he says .
as the scandal develops and the public outcry in europe mounts , the onus will be on european leaders , rather than washington officials , to explain themselves to their constituencies and to the european union , jeremy shapiro , research director at the brookings institution 's center on the united states and europe and an expert on military and national security issues , told afp . " this is likely to be a test for the eu , " shapiro said .
" i do n't think it 's going to be a huge problem for the us government or for transatlantic relations , but it is going to be perhaps a domestic issue in some of these countries and perhaps an intra-european issue in calling into question just what being a member of the eu allows you to do and not do . "
washi n gto n mum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus seems to be on europe to investigate the allegations officials in washington have largely kept silent on the issue , as has the us media .
state department spokesman adam ereli said relations with all the countries mentioned as possible sites of prisons or stopovers - including germany , hungary , italy , morocco , norway , poland , romania and sweden - had not been affected by the allegations , afp reported . " with all of those countries , we have close , cordial , cooperative relations on a wide range of issues , including cooperation in the global war on terror , and that kind of understanding and cooperation and partnership continues , " he said . sweden on thursday became the latest country to announce it would probe the allegations that cia planes carrying prisoners stopped on their territory .

beginning next year , it will be split into two parts . german semi-conductors giant infineon reported losses friday , a day after their board approved plans to spin off the company 's loss-making chip business into its own company . infineon said in a statement that it booked net loss of 312 million euros -lrb- $ 365 million -rrb- in the 12 months to september , compared with profit of 61 million euros a year earlier .
in the fourth quarter alone , the chip-maker was also back in the red , booking bottom-line loss of 100 million euros , compared with a profit of 44 million euros a year earlier . nevertheless , the fourth-quarter loss was narrower than the loss of 240 million euros recorded in the third quarter .
on an annual basis , underlying earnings also deteriorated , with infineon running up full-year operating loss of 182 million euros compared with a year-earlier profit of 256 million euros . full-year sales were down 6 percent at 6.759 billion euros .
in the fourth quarter alone , the operating loss stood at 43 million euros , an improvement on the third-quarter loss of 234 million euros . falli n g dema n d , restructuri n g to blame " the narrower loss is primarily attributable to slightly higher sales prices and a strong reduction in costs in the memory products segment , " said chairman wolfgang zeibart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang ziebart it was the strong competition in the chip market that pushed infineon to decide to spin-off its memory chip segment .
the company reported only 61 million euros in profit on 7.2 billion euros in sales in 2004 .
initially , the memory products business would be made into a legally independent entity by july 1 , 2006 and after that infineon would consider floating it on the stock exchange .
the spin-off will help the company concentrate instead on its logic activities in sectors such as the automotive and communications , industrial electronics industries . in addition , third-quarter earnings had been hit by one-off charges " connected with the planned phase-out of production at the group 's plant in munich-perlach , " the company explained .
the planned closure was met with protests by the striking wokers at the end of october .
more than 800 are expected to lose their jobs . infineon attributed the decline in full-year sales to " falling demand from some customers for mobile phone components and continued pricing pressure in all operating segments . " memory products busi n ess stro n g by division , the memory products business turned in operating profit of 34 million euros in the fourth quarter , compared with a loss of 149 million euros in the preceding three months .
on a full-year basis , however , the division saw operating profit fall by 28 percent to 122 million euros on a three-percent drop in sales to 2.826 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking workers at the plant at the end of october .
more than 800 will lose their jobs infineon had announced thursday that it intended to spin off the activities into a legally independent unit next year with a view to a possible stock market flotation . in the logic products division , operating profit from the automotive , industrial and multimarket business fell by 47 percent to 134 million euros on a full-basis and sales slipped by one percent to 2.516 billion euros . i n vestors looki n g forward the communications business saw its operating loss widen to 295 million euros from 44 million euros a year earlier and sales decline by 18 percent to 1.391 billion euros . looking ahead , infineon said it was targeting sales growth at least equal to the market as a whole .
zeibart declined to make any earnings forecast . investors appeared to believe that the numbers were not as bad as feared and infineon shares were showing a gain of 1.13 percent at 8.04 euros in mid-morning trade on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon 's troubles keep growing infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .

germany has been named as a stopping off point for planes that allegedly transported terror suspects to secret cia prisons in european countries .
the government has no plans to investigate .
the opposition says it should . germany will instead wait until it gets the results of an investigation by the public prosecutor in the town of zweibrücken , a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry told the berli n er zeitu n g daily . the zweibrücken public prosecutor is examining the february 2003 kidnapping in italy by cia agents of hassan mustafa osama nasr , also known as abu omar , a former imam who was allegedly brought to the us military base at ramstein in southwestern germany prior to his being taken to his native country , egypt .
in italy last week , the milan public prosecutor demanded the extradition of 22 cia agents believed to have been involved in the abduction of omar , the subject of an italian anti-terrorist investigation . " the foreign minister should have a talk with the us ambassador , " top free democratic party politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the berli n er zeitu n g .
" if the so far unproven accusations are correct , it would be outrageous , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said . green party military expert winfried nachtwei also said the german government should talk to the americans , and find out what happened .
if the allegations were indeed true , they would be " highly alarming . "

he claims he was held prisoner in a macedonian hotel for 23 days , after which he was flown to a jail in afghanistan and accused of being a member of al qaeda .
he was only taken back to europe following months of interrogation , he says .
as the scandal develops and the public outcry in europe mounts , the onus will be on european leaders , rather than washington officials , to explain themselves to their constituencies and to the european union , jeremy shapiro , research director at the brookings institution 's center on the united states and europe and an expert on military and national security issues , told afp . " this is likely to be a test for the eu , " shapiro said .
" i do n't think it 's going to be a huge problem for the us government or for transatlantic relations , but it is going to be perhaps a domestic issue in some of these countries and perhaps an intra-european issue in calling into question just what being a member of the eu allows you to do and not do . "
washi n gto n mum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus seems to be on europe to investigate the allegations officials in washington have largely kept silent on the issue , as has the us media .

" with all of those countries , we have close , cordial , cooperative relations on a wide range of issues , including cooperation in the global war on terror , and that kind of understanding and cooperation and partnership continues , " he said . sweden on thursday became the latest country to announce it would probe the allegations that cia planes carrying prisoners stopped on their territory .

20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .

20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .

a spokesman for the public prosecutors office said irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty . the right-wing historian was apparently on his way to a students ' club in vienna when he was stopped , austria 's apa agency said .
such clubs are often linked to far-right or pan-germanic movements . far-right activism the 67-year-old british born historian has been active in far right circles since the 1960 's , gaining worldwide notoreity for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that adolf hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was wildly exaggerated . he made his name with a book about the allied air raids on dresden and biographies of general erwin rommel and the nazi deputy leader rudolph hess .
in " hitler 's war , " he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings until 1943 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt leaving court in 2000 five years ago he was involved in a high profile court case in which he sued the american author deborah lipstadt for accusing him of holocaust denial .
he lost the case . international bans this is the second time austrian police have arrested david irving . on the first occasion in 1984 he was deported to germany .
for now he is likely to remain in investigative custody for at least a week while prosecutors investigate whether they can proceed on an arrest warrant served so many years after the alleged offense was committed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , where denying the holocaust is a crime , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand . he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . kerry skyring -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg 's legacy lives on in struggle for international justice the nuremberg trials of 22 nazi leaders opened on nov .

in italy last week , the milan public prosecutor demanded the extradition of 22 cia agents believed to have been involved in the abduction of omar , the subject of an italian anti-terrorist investigation . " the foreign minister should have a talk with the us ambassador , " top free democratic party politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the berli n er zeitu n g .

sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused .

it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .

in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .

20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .
otherwise , it is difficult to see how they can ask us to fight terrorism with civilized means , but not allow international jurisdiction to fight against crimes committed by terrorists .

beginning next year , it will be split into two parts . german semi-conductors giant infineon reported losses friday , a day after their board approved plans to spin off the company 's loss-making chip business into its own company . infineon said in a statement that it booked net loss of 312 million euros -lrb- $ 365 million -rrb- in the 12 months to september , compared with profit of 61 million euros a year earlier .
in the fourth quarter alone , the chip-maker was also back in the red , booking bottom-line loss of 100 million euros , compared with a profit of 44 million euros a year earlier . nevertheless , the fourth-quarter loss was narrower than the loss of 240 million euros recorded in the third quarter .
on an annual basis , underlying earnings also deteriorated , with infineon running up full-year operating loss of 182 million euros compared with a year-earlier profit of 256 million euros . full-year sales were down 6 percent at 6.759 billion euros .
in the fourth quarter alone , the operating loss stood at 43 million euros , an improvement on the third-quarter loss of 234 million euros . falli n g dema n d , restructuri n g to blame " the narrower loss is primarily attributable to slightly higher sales prices and a strong reduction in costs in the memory products segment , " said chairman wolfgang zeibart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang ziebart it was the strong competition in the chip market that pushed infineon to decide to spin-off its memory chip segment .
the company reported only 61 million euros in profit on 7.2 billion euros in sales in 2004 .
initially , the memory products business would be made into a legally independent entity by july 1 , 2006 and after that infineon would consider floating it on the stock exchange .
the spin-off will help the company concentrate instead on its logic activities in sectors such as the automotive and communications , industrial electronics industries . in addition , third-quarter earnings had been hit by one-off charges " connected with the planned phase-out of production at the group 's plant in munich-perlach , " the company explained .
the planned closure was met with protests by the striking wokers at the end of october .
more than 800 are expected to lose their jobs . infineon attributed the decline in full-year sales to " falling demand from some customers for mobile phone components and continued pricing pressure in all operating segments . " memory products busi n ess stro n g by division , the memory products business turned in operating profit of 34 million euros in the fourth quarter , compared with a loss of 149 million euros in the preceding three months .
on a full-year basis , however , the division saw operating profit fall by 28 percent to 122 million euros on a three-percent drop in sales to 2.826 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking workers at the plant at the end of october .
more than 800 will lose their jobs infineon had announced thursday that it intended to spin off the activities into a legally independent unit next year with a view to a possible stock market flotation . in the logic products division , operating profit from the automotive , industrial and multimarket business fell by 47 percent to 134 million euros on a full-basis and sales slipped by one percent to 2.516 billion euros . i n vestors looki n g forward the communications business saw its operating loss widen to 295 million euros from 44 million euros a year earlier and sales decline by 18 percent to 1.391 billion euros . looking ahead , infineon said it was targeting sales growth at least equal to the market as a whole .
zeibart declined to make any earnings forecast . investors appeared to believe that the numbers were not as bad as feared and infineon shares were showing a gain of 1.13 percent at 8.04 euros in mid-morning trade on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon 's troubles keep growing infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .

germany has been named as a stopping off point for planes that allegedly transported terror suspects to secret cia prisons in european countries .
the government has no plans to investigate .
the opposition says it should . germany will instead wait until it gets the results of an investigation by the public prosecutor in the town of zweibrücken , a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry told the berli n er zeitu n g daily . the zweibrücken public prosecutor is examining the february 2003 kidnapping in italy by cia agents of hassan mustafa osama nasr , also known as abu omar , a former imam who was allegedly brought to the us military base at ramstein in southwestern germany prior to his being taken to his native country , egypt .
in italy last week , the milan public prosecutor demanded the extradition of 22 cia agents believed to have been involved in the abduction of omar , the subject of an italian anti-terrorist investigation . " the foreign minister should have a talk with the us ambassador , " top free democratic party politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the berli n er zeitu n g .
" if the so far unproven accusations are correct , it would be outrageous , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said . green party military expert winfried nachtwei also said the german government should talk to the americans , and find out what happened .
if the allegations were indeed true , they would be " highly alarming . "

us-based independent watchdog human rights watch said it was " practically convinced " that such detention centers , so-called black sites , existed . in another case , munich public prosecutors are investigating the alleged kidnapping of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri .
he says americans were involved in his kidnapping on dec .
31 , 2003 on the serbian-macedonian border .
he claims he was held prisoner in a macedonian hotel for 23 days , after which he was flown to a jail in afghanistan and accused of being a member of al qaeda .
he was only taken back to europe following months of interrogation , he says .
as the scandal develops and the public outcry in europe mounts , the onus will be on european leaders , rather than washington officials , to explain themselves to their constituencies and to the european union , jeremy shapiro , research director at the brookings institution 's center on the united states and europe and an expert on military and national security issues , told afp . " this is likely to be a test for the eu , " shapiro said .
" i do n't think it 's going to be a huge problem for the us government or for transatlantic relations , but it is going to be perhaps a domestic issue in some of these countries and perhaps an intra-european issue in calling into question just what being a member of the eu allows you to do and not do . "
washi n gto n mum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus seems to be on europe to investigate the allegations officials in washington have largely kept silent on the issue , as has the us media .
state department spokesman adam ereli said relations with all the countries mentioned as possible sites of prisons or stopovers - including germany , hungary , italy , morocco , norway , poland , romania and sweden - had not been affected by the allegations , afp reported . " with all of those countries , we have close , cordial , cooperative relations on a wide range of issues , including cooperation in the global war on terror , and that kind of understanding and cooperation and partnership continues , " he said . sweden on thursday became the latest country to announce it would probe the allegations that cia planes carrying prisoners stopped on their territory .

sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .

" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .

beginning next year , it will be split into two parts . german semi-conductors giant infineon reported losses friday , a day after their board approved plans to spin off the company 's loss-making chip business into its own company . infineon said in a statement that it booked net loss of 312 million euros -lrb- $ 365 million -rrb- in the 12 months to september , compared with profit of 61 million euros a year earlier .
in the fourth quarter alone , the chip-maker was also back in the red , booking bottom-line loss of 100 million euros , compared with a profit of 44 million euros a year earlier . nevertheless , the fourth-quarter loss was narrower than the loss of 240 million euros recorded in the third quarter .
on an annual basis , underlying earnings also deteriorated , with infineon running up full-year operating loss of 182 million euros compared with a year-earlier profit of 256 million euros . full-year sales were down 6 percent at 6.759 billion euros .
in the fourth quarter alone , the operating loss stood at 43 million euros , an improvement on the third-quarter loss of 234 million euros . falli n g dema n d , restructuri n g to blame " the narrower loss is primarily attributable to slightly higher sales prices and a strong reduction in costs in the memory products segment , " said chairman wolfgang zeibart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang ziebart it was the strong competition in the chip market that pushed infineon to decide to spin-off its memory chip segment .
the company reported only 61 million euros in profit on 7.2 billion euros in sales in 2004 .
initially , the memory products business would be made into a legally independent entity by july 1 , 2006 and after that infineon would consider floating it on the stock exchange .
the spin-off will help the company concentrate instead on its logic activities in sectors such as the automotive and communications , industrial electronics industries . in addition , third-quarter earnings had been hit by one-off charges " connected with the planned phase-out of production at the group 's plant in munich-perlach , " the company explained .
the planned closure was met with protests by the striking wokers at the end of october .
more than 800 are expected to lose their jobs . infineon attributed the decline in full-year sales to " falling demand from some customers for mobile phone components and continued pricing pressure in all operating segments . " memory products busi n ess stro n g by division , the memory products business turned in operating profit of 34 million euros in the fourth quarter , compared with a loss of 149 million euros in the preceding three months .
on a full-year basis , however , the division saw operating profit fall by 28 percent to 122 million euros on a three-percent drop in sales to 2.826 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking workers at the plant at the end of october .
more than 800 will lose their jobs infineon had announced thursday that it intended to spin off the activities into a legally independent unit next year with a view to a possible stock market flotation . in the logic products division , operating profit from the automotive , industrial and multimarket business fell by 47 percent to 134 million euros on a full-basis and sales slipped by one percent to 2.516 billion euros . i n vestors looki n g forward the communications business saw its operating loss widen to 295 million euros from 44 million euros a year earlier and sales decline by 18 percent to 1.391 billion euros . looking ahead , infineon said it was targeting sales growth at least equal to the market as a whole .
zeibart declined to make any earnings forecast . investors appeared to believe that the numbers were not as bad as feared and infineon shares were showing a gain of 1.13 percent at 8.04 euros in mid-morning trade on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon 's troubles keep growing infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .
the financial bad news comes on the heels of a corruption scandal .

a spokesman for the public prosecutors office said irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty . the right-wing historian was apparently on his way to a students ' club in vienna when he was stopped , austria 's apa agency said .
such clubs are often linked to far-right or pan-germanic movements . far-right activism the 67-year-old british born historian has been active in far right circles since the 1960 's , gaining worldwide notoreity for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that adolf hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was wildly exaggerated . he made his name with a book about the allied air raids on dresden and biographies of general erwin rommel and the nazi deputy leader rudolph hess .

he lost the case . international bans this is the second time austrian police have arrested david irving . on the first occasion in 1984 he was deported to germany .
for now he is likely to remain in investigative custody for at least a week while prosecutors investigate whether they can proceed on an arrest warrant served so many years after the alleged offense was committed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , where denying the holocaust is a crime , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand . he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . kerry skyring -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg 's legacy lives on in struggle for international justice the nuremberg trials of 22 nazi leaders opened on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.11.2005 nuremberg 's legacy lives on in struggle for international justice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice for the nazis began in nuremberg 's courtroom 600 the nuremberg trials of 22 nazi leaders opened on nov .
20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .
otherwise , it is difficult to see how they can ask us to fight terrorism with civilized means , but not allow international jurisdiction to fight against crimes committed by terrorists .

germany has been named as a stopping off point for planes that allegedly transported terror suspects to secret cia prisons in european countries .
the government has no plans to investigate .
the opposition says it should . germany will instead wait until it gets the results of an investigation by the public prosecutor in the town of zweibrücken , a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry told the berli n er zeitu n g daily . the zweibrücken public prosecutor is examining the february 2003 kidnapping in italy by cia agents of hassan mustafa osama nasr , also known as abu omar , a former imam who was allegedly brought to the us military base at ramstein in southwestern germany prior to his being taken to his native country , egypt .
in italy last week , the milan public prosecutor demanded the extradition of 22 cia agents believed to have been involved in the abduction of omar , the subject of an italian anti-terrorist investigation . " the foreign minister should have a talk with the us ambassador , " top free democratic party politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the berli n er zeitu n g .
" if the so far unproven accusations are correct , it would be outrageous , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said . green party military expert winfried nachtwei also said the german government should talk to the americans , and find out what happened .
if the allegations were indeed true , they would be " highly alarming . "

11 , 2001 attacks .
us-based independent watchdog human rights watch said it was " practically convinced " that such detention centers , so-called black sites , existed . in another case , munich public prosecutors are investigating the alleged kidnapping of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri .
he says americans were involved in his kidnapping on dec .
31 , 2003 on the serbian-macedonian border .
he claims he was held prisoner in a macedonian hotel for 23 days , after which he was flown to a jail in afghanistan and accused of being a member of al qaeda .
he was only taken back to europe following months of interrogation , he says .
as the scandal develops and the public outcry in europe mounts , the onus will be on european leaders , rather than washington officials , to explain themselves to their constituencies and to the european union , jeremy shapiro , research director at the brookings institution 's center on the united states and europe and an expert on military and national security issues , told afp . " this is likely to be a test for the eu , " shapiro said .
" i do n't think it 's going to be a huge problem for the us government or for transatlantic relations , but it is going to be perhaps a domestic issue in some of these countries and perhaps an intra-european issue in calling into question just what being a member of the eu allows you to do and not do . "
washi n gto n mum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus seems to be on europe to investigate the allegations officials in washington have largely kept silent on the issue , as has the us media .
state department spokesman adam ereli said relations with all the countries mentioned as possible sites of prisons or stopovers - including germany , hungary , italy , morocco , norway , poland , romania and sweden - had not been affected by the allegations , afp reported . " with all of those countries , we have close , cordial , cooperative relations on a wide range of issues , including cooperation in the global war on terror , and that kind of understanding and cooperation and partnership continues , " he said . sweden on thursday became the latest country to announce it would probe the allegations that cia planes carrying prisoners stopped on their territory .

20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .
otherwise , it is difficult to see how they can ask us to fight terrorism with civilized means , but not allow international jurisdiction to fight against crimes committed by terrorists .

sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused .

" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .

" the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .

20 , 1945 .
sixty years later , nuremberg 's legacy is apparent in the development of modern international law , even if the americans are no longer setting the tone . the city of nuremberg today is practically synonymous with the milestone in international justice that was the nuremberg war crimes tribunal .
set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .

germany has been named as a stopping off point for planes that allegedly transported terror suspects to secret cia prisons in european countries .

the opposition says it should . germany will instead wait until it gets the results of an investigation by the public prosecutor in the town of zweibrücken , a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry told the berli n er zeitu n g daily . the zweibrücken public prosecutor is examining the february 2003 kidnapping in italy by cia agents of hassan mustafa osama nasr , also known as abu omar , a former imam who was allegedly brought to the us military base at ramstein in southwestern germany prior to his being taken to his native country , egypt .
in italy last week , the milan public prosecutor demanded the extradition of 22 cia agents believed to have been involved in the abduction of omar , the subject of an italian anti-terrorist investigation .

germany has been named as a stopping off point for planes that allegedly transported terror suspects to secret cia prisons in european countries .
the government has no plans to investigate .
the opposition says it should . germany will instead wait until it gets the results of an investigation by the public prosecutor in the town of zweibrücken , a spokesperson for the german foreign ministry told the berli n er zeitu n g daily . the zweibrücken public prosecutor is examining the february 2003 kidnapping in italy by cia agents of hassan mustafa osama nasr , also known as abu omar , a former imam who was allegedly brought to the us military base at ramstein in southwestern germany prior to his being taken to his native country , egypt .
in italy last week , the milan public prosecutor demanded the extradition of 22 cia agents believed to have been involved in the abduction of omar , the subject of an italian anti-terrorist investigation . " the foreign minister should have a talk with the us ambassador , " top free democratic party politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told the berli n er zeitu n g .
" if the so far unproven accusations are correct , it would be outrageous , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said . green party military expert winfried nachtwei also said the german government should talk to the americans , and find out what happened .
if the allegations were indeed true , they would be " highly alarming . "

11 , 2001 attacks .
us-based independent watchdog human rights watch said it was " practically convinced " that such detention centers , so-called black sites , existed . in another case , munich public prosecutors are investigating the alleged kidnapping of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri .
he says americans were involved in his kidnapping on dec .
31 , 2003 on the serbian-macedonian border .
he claims he was held prisoner in a macedonian hotel for 23 days , after which he was flown to a jail in afghanistan and accused of being a member of al qaeda .
he was only taken back to europe following months of interrogation , he says .
as the scandal develops and the public outcry in europe mounts , the onus will be on european leaders , rather than washington officials , to explain themselves to their constituencies and to the european union , jeremy shapiro , research director at the brookings institution 's center on the united states and europe and an expert on military and national security issues , told afp . " this is likely to be a test for the eu , " shapiro said .
" i do n't think it 's going to be a huge problem for the us government or for transatlantic relations , but it is going to be perhaps a domestic issue in some of these countries and perhaps an intra-european issue in calling into question just what being a member of the eu allows you to do and not do . "
washi n gto n mum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus seems to be on europe to investigate the allegations officials in washington have largely kept silent on the issue , as has the us media .
state department spokesman adam ereli said relations with all the countries mentioned as possible sites of prisons or stopovers - including germany , hungary , italy , morocco , norway , poland , romania and sweden - had not been affected by the allegations , afp reported . " with all of those countries , we have close , cordial , cooperative relations on a wide range of issues , including cooperation in the global war on terror , and that kind of understanding and cooperation and partnership continues , " he said . sweden on thursday became the latest country to announce it would probe the allegations that cia planes carrying prisoners stopped on their territory .

a spokesman for the public prosecutors office said irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty . the right-wing historian was apparently on his way to a students ' club in vienna when he was stopped , austria 's apa agency said .
such clubs are often linked to far-right or pan-germanic movements . far-right activism the 67-year-old british born historian has been active in far right circles since the 1960 's , gaining worldwide notoreity for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that adolf hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was wildly exaggerated . he made his name with a book about the allied air raids on dresden and biographies of general erwin rommel and the nazi deputy leader rudolph hess .
in " hitler 's war , " he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings until 1943 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt leaving court in 2000 five years ago he was involved in a high profile court case in which he sued the american author deborah lipstadt for accusing him of holocaust denial .
he lost the case . international bans this is the second time austrian police have arrested david irving . on the first occasion in 1984 he was deported to germany .
for now he is likely to remain in investigative custody for at least a week while prosecutors investigate whether they can proceed on an arrest warrant served so many years after the alleged offense was committed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving could face 20 years in jail if found guilty he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , where denying the holocaust is a crime , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand . he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . kerry skyring -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg 's legacy lives on in struggle for international justice the nuremberg trials of 22 nazi leaders opened on nov .

set up by the allies at the end of world war ii , the tribunal headed by american chief justice robert jackson tried 22 nazi elites , including hermann göring , rudolf hess and joachim von ribbentrop .
the trials lasted for over a year , and resulted in 12 death sentences being handed down .
göring was convicted , but committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring stands in the prisoner 's dock at the nuremberg war crimes tribunal nuremberg was revolutionary in many respects , not least because of the advances it made in protecting the rights of the accused . " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow , " jackson said at the opening session .
" to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well . " nuremberg was the first time that war crimes were tried before an international tribunal .
it was clear from jackson 's approach that the americans , in particular , hoped the tribunal would serve as a model for a future international justice system with a permanent international criminal court to handle cases of genocide and crimes against humanity . from proponent to opponent ironically , in the years that followed , the united states became the biggest force of resistance to the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague , said uwe wesel , professor emeritus in civil law and history of law at berlin 's free university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court in the hague " at the time of the nuremberg trials , the united nations set up an international law commission , but this commission has had to deal with repeated stumbling blocks , " wesel said .
" the cold war came , and the united states started to think twice about participating , because of the fear that americans could also be tried for war crimes .
after the collapse of the soviet union , when the us no longer had to fear being drawn into a war with the soviet union , they continued to hesitate . " given us obstinacy to the codifying of international law , the fact that the icc now exists is a " miracle , " wesel said . " the hostility of the us toward international criminal justice has only been strengthened under the bush administration , resulting in the passing of the american service-member 's protection act , which allows the us to use violence to free american servicemen and women being held in custody by the icc if necessary , " he said . setting legal precedents nevertheless , experts see in nuremberg the roots for all subsequent human rights trials , from the prosecution of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to the trials of those accused of genocide in rwanda , to the trial of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . however , the decision to try saddam at a special court in iraq has been seen by some experts as a failure to learn from the lessons of nuremberg .
in 1945 , the allies were criticized by legal scholars who said it was inappropriate for the victors to mete out justice to those they 'd conquered . wolfgang schomburg , the only german judge to sit on the un tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , said the iraqi court , set up during the us occupation , also had some features of victors ' justice , and that a better solution would have been to bring his case before an international court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge wolfgang schomburg " the trial would have more legitimacy if the case were being heard before an international tribunal , " schomburg said .
" such crimes are always crimes committed against the civilized world , so the answer should also follow from the civilized world , meaning an international tribunal with a more distanced , neutral view . " germany 's lessons schomburg is living proof that nations whose citizens commit heinous crimes against humanity can , with the help of fair judicial proceedings , come to terms with the past , and move on .
though he sees himself as an international judge , he is aware that his german nationality has presented him with a unique opportunity to show the world that germany has returned to normalcy . " i 'm celebrating the fact that i have concluded my first four years of tenure at the tribunal without one single staff member ever questioning how i , as a german , can act in this tribunal , " schomburg said .
" on the other hand , i am personally very often moved when i quote from judgments made at nuremberg , to see how we are always being confronted with the past and the lessons learned by german society . " for his part , schomburg has not given up hope that the united states will one day return to the path it embarked on during the nuremberg trials by endorsing the international criminal court . " i 'm always an optimist , " schomburg said .
" i think the us has made an incredible contribution to the rule of law , to fundamental rights .
eventually , the us wo n't be able to do anything but ratify the icc , because they will see it is in their own interest .
otherwise , it is difficult to see how they can ask us to fight terrorism with civilized means , but not allow international jurisdiction to fight against crimes committed by terrorists .

glasgow and edinburgh university experts found damage to a gene involved in how the brain thinks increases risk .
the team , writing in the magazine science , say the finding could lead to the development of new drugs .
but the researchers stress environmental factors also influence the odds of developing mental illness . "
any research that seeks to shed light on these complex interactions is to be welcomed , but the results should not be presented as the definitive cause of schizophrenia " paul corry , rethink five years ago , the scottish team identified a key faulty gene called disc1 , which acts as a " hub " gene , controlling other " spoke " genes around it .
in the latest work , the team have shown that a second gene - phosphodiesterase 4b -lrb- pde4b -rrb- - also plays a crucial role .
this gene was already known to be involved in brain development and memory storage .
damage to either or both genes can increase the risk of a mental health problem , the researchers say .
the extent of the flaws influence what kind of illness someone has , and its severity , they suggest .
both genes determine the behaviour of one specific protein , which interact with each other .
it is this interaction which scientists think could be targeted with drugs , perhaps by modifying the amount or quality of the disc1 protein , or by changing the way the pde4b protein behaves .
the researchers worked along with scientists from the pharmaceutical company merck , sharp & dohme limited .
' tantalising , but speculative ' professor david porteous at the university of edinburgh , who led the work , said : " it is now clear that the disc1 gene plays an important role in the risk of developing schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder -lsb- manic depression -rsb- .
" the new genetic link we have made to pde4b and how that links back to disc1 sheds much needed light on these debilitating disorders .
it also suggests a new way of thinking about developing better and effective medicines . "
but he added : " risk is n't all controlled by genes .
it 's very much an interaction between genes and environmental factors . "
but in a commentary in science , dr akira sawa and dr solomon snyder of the departments of psychiatry and neuroscience at johns hopkins university , warned : " however tantalising , the prediction of drug effects is still highly speculative . "
paul corry , of the mental health charity rethink , said : " what this research underlines is that schizophrenia is a very complex condition involving an interaction of various genes in ways that have not been defined .
" the research offers wider clues to the interaction between genes and any research that seeks to shed light on these complex interactions is to be welcomed , but the results should not be presented as the definitive cause of schizophrenia . "
he added : " while we welcome any new research or progress into understanding the causes of schizophrenia , it would need to be checked before it would make a difference to the thousands of people living with severe mental illness in the uk . "

it is this interaction which scientists think could be targeted with drugs , perhaps by modifying the amount or quality of the disc1 protein , or by changing the way the pde4b protein behaves .
the researchers worked along with scientists from the pharmaceutical company merck , sharp & dohme limited .
' tantalising , but speculative ' professor david porteous at the university of edinburgh , who led the work , said : " it is now clear that the disc1 gene plays an important role in the risk of developing schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder -lsb- manic depression -rsb- .
" the new genetic link we have made to pde4b and how that links back to disc1 sheds much needed light on these debilitating disorders .
it also suggests a new way of thinking about developing better and effective medicines . "
but he added : " risk is n't all controlled by genes .
it 's very much an interaction between genes and environmental factors . "
but in a commentary in science , dr akira sawa and dr solomon snyder of the departments of psychiatry and neuroscience at johns hopkins university , warned : " however tantalising , the prediction of drug effects is still highly speculative . "
paul corry , of the mental health charity rethink , said : " what this research underlines is that schizophrenia is a very complex condition involving an interaction of various genes in ways that have not been defined .
" the research offers wider clues to the interaction between genes and any research that seeks to shed light on these complex interactions is to be welcomed , but the results should not be presented as the definitive cause of schizophrenia . "
he added : " while we welcome any new research or progress into understanding the causes of schizophrenia , it would need to be checked before it would make a difference to the thousands of people living with severe mental illness in the uk . "

the cause with which he has been associated longest is that of the sinhala community of southern sri lanka , into which he was born 60 years ago .
the southern sinhalas first voted for mr rajapaksa in 1970 , making him - then aged 24 - the country 's youngest ever parliamentarian .
analysts say their support helped him become prime minister , beating his rival , lakshman kadirgamar , the former foreign minister who was assassinated in august .
compromise candidate mr rajapaksa , who represents chandrika kumaratunga 's sri lanka freedom party , is seen as a man of the masses .
" he comes accross as the homegrown country boy -lrb- to the poor farmers and fishermen -rrb- whom they feel comfortable with , " analyst jehan perera told the associated press .
mr rajapaksa comes from a political family - his father , da rajapaksa , represented the same region of hambantota from 1947 to 1965 .
as labour minister , mr rajapaksa tried to push through legislation to guarantee the rights of workers - but failed after complaints from big businesses .
while in charge of fisheries and ports , he became popular for his scheme to find new housing for slum-dwelling fishermen .
until his appointment as prime minister , he was opposition leader in parliament .
he is a member of the governing coalition united people 's freedom alliance .
it won most seats in the general election , but not enough to gain a majority .
hardline stance when he became prime minister , he was seen as someone who favoured a negotiated settlement with the tamil tiger rebels .
but after signing a poll deal with two nationalist parties , his stance has become increasingly hardline .
he launched his campaign for the presidency by rejecting the rebels ' demands for tamil autonomy .
he has also vowed to review the 2002 ceasefire with the rebels and also indicated that norway will no longer play a role as a peace broker .
his election also casts further doubt over a tsunami aid deal reached between mrs kumaratunga and the tamil tigers over the thorny subject of how to distribute international aid money to tsunami victims .
mr rajapaksa promised to tear up the deal - that would result in further delays in funds reaching the tsunami victims .

directed by mike newell of four weddings and a funeral fame , it will be the fourth hit in a row for its young stars daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint .
all three have been signed up for the fifth film , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , due out in summer 2007 .
by then , however , the series ' status as hollywood 's pre-eminent fantasy franchise may be under threat from another blockbuster saga looming on the horizon - the chronicles of narnia , which is released in the uk on 8 december .
mystical landscape for three consecutive christmases between 2001 and 2003 , audiences flocked to see the three instalments in peter jackson 's epic lord of the rings .
the first two of these , the fellowship of the ring and the two towers , opened in close proximity to the first two potter titles , the philosopher 's stone and the chamber of secrets .
the first potter narrowly outperformed fellowship at the us box office , but the situation was reversed the following year .
their success proved there was a strong demand for epic adventure based on popular fantasy fiction .
and it is precisely that demographic that walt disney pictures and its producing partner walden media hope to target with their $ 150m -lrb- £ 85m -rrb- version of cs lewis 's narnia adventure , the lion , the witch and the wardrobe .
like the lord of the rings , the film is based on a 20th century literary classic and has been mostly shot in new zealand , on soundstages previously used for jackson 's films .
but with six more narnia books optioned , the nascent franchise has even more material to draw on than the jrr tolkien-inspired trilogy .
as in jk rowling 's potter books , the lead narnia characters are children caught up in spectacular adventures involving witches , magic and outlandish creatures .
where the narnia series differs is that the children do not feature in every book , meaning any sequels would not be as reliant on specific child actors as the potter films are .
time has been a pervasive factor in the potter series , with radcliffe , watson and grint all ageing faster than their fictional counterparts .
one more outing is guaranteed , but it has been suggested that the series will need to be recast by the time the sixth book and the as-yet-unwritten seventh instalment are made into films .
that is not a concern for the narnia series , whose real star is narnia itself - a mystical landscape where animals can talk , mythical beasts are common and pools become portals to different worlds .
it is a complex setting that has more in common with tolkien 's middle-earth than jk rowling 's relatively insular hogwarts .
and , like middle-earth , it comes with its own detailed history , geography , mythology and even cosmology .
unknown quantity it remains to be seen how much of this will feature in the first narnia film , which is being pitched to audiences as a fast-paced , effects-based action adventure .
it is notable , too , that while walden media have optioned all the other narnia books , a follow-up has yet to be announced .
note also how the producers have opted for the most familiar of lewis ' series , rather than its chronological prequel , the magician 's nephew .
it is a decision that reflects the fact that - outside of devoted readers of fantasy literature - the chronicles of narnia remain something of an unknown quantity .
" this is really the only narnia book to make , " says chris hewitt , associate editor of empire magazine .
" i do n't think the others made that much of an impact . "
despite the name recognition , however , hewitt expresses some pessimism about its chances .
" i do n't think there 's a huge buzz around narnia , " he says .
" there 's no lord of the rings this year for the second year in a row , so our readers want something to fill that gap .
" but i think harry potter will be the more successful of the two - and while narnia could be a good one-off instalment , the world 's not really waiting for a sequel . "
in the end , though , a third candidate - king kong , jackson 's first film since the lord of the rings - may prove a bigger hit than both .
wizards and witches are all very well , but on or off the screen neither would stand much of a chance against a 25-foot ape .

mystical landscape for three consecutive christmases between 2001 and 2003 , audiences flocked to see the three instalments in peter jackson 's epic lord of the rings .
the first two of these , the fellowship of the ring and the two towers , opened in close proximity to the first two potter titles , the philosopher 's stone and the chamber of secrets .
the first potter narrowly outperformed fellowship at the us box office , but the situation was reversed the following year .
their success proved there was a strong demand for epic adventure based on popular fantasy fiction .
and it is precisely that demographic that walt disney pictures and its producing partner walden media hope to target with their $ 150m -lrb- £ 85m -rrb- version of cs lewis 's narnia adventure , the lion , the witch and the wardrobe .
like the lord of the rings , the film is based on a 20th century literary classic and has been mostly shot in new zealand , on soundstages previously used for jackson 's films .
but with six more narnia books optioned , the nascent franchise has even more material to draw on than the jrr tolkien-inspired trilogy .
tilda swinton plays the white witch in the chronicles of narnia as in jk rowling 's potter books , the lead narnia characters are children caught up in spectacular adventures involving witches , magic and outlandish creatures .
where the narnia series differs is that the children do not feature in every book , meaning any sequels would not be as reliant on specific child actors as the potter films are .
time has been a pervasive factor in the potter series , with radcliffe , watson and grint all ageing faster than their fictional counterparts .
one more outing is guaranteed , but it has been suggested that the series will need to be recast by the time the sixth book and the as-yet-unwritten seventh instalment are made into films .
that is not a concern for the narnia series , whose real star is narnia itself - a mystical landscape where animals can talk , mythical beasts are common and pools become portals to different worlds .
it is a complex setting that has more in common with tolkien 's middle-earth than jk rowling 's relatively insular hogwarts .
and , like middle-earth , it comes with its own detailed history , geography , mythology and even cosmology .
unknown quantity it remains to be seen how much of this will feature in the first narnia film , which is being pitched to audiences as a fast-paced , effects-based action adventure .
it is notable , too , that while walden media have optioned all the other narnia books , a follow-up has yet to be announced .
note also how the producers have opted for the most familiar of lewis ' series , rather than its chronological prequel , the magician 's nephew .
narnia tells the story of four children transported to a magical kingdom it is a decision that reflects the fact that - outside of devoted readers of fantasy literature - the chronicles of narnia remain something of an unknown quantity .
" this is really the only narnia book to make , " says chris hewitt , associate editor of empire magazine .
" i do n't think the others made that much of an impact . "
despite the name recognition , however , hewitt expresses some pessimism about its chances .
" i do n't think there 's a huge buzz around narnia , " he says .

" but i think harry potter will be the more successful of the two - and while narnia could be a good one-off instalment , the world 's not really waiting for a sequel . "
in the end , though , a third candidate - king kong , jackson 's first film since the lord of the rings - may prove a bigger hit than both .
wizards and witches are all very well , but on or off the screen neither would stand much of a chance against a 25-foot ape .

but there are those who are looking to existing mobile phone technologies as the way to connect the world .
" everyone is talking about the digital divide , but the real issue is getting phones in everyone 's hand , " tom phillips , the head of gsm association 's policy unit , told the bbc news website .
" the core message is simple ; 80 % of the world has mobile coverage yet only 25 % is accessing it , " he said while the likes of intel are pushing next-generation wireless technologies such as wimax , mr phillips said that governments should be improving existing mobile networks and rolling out high-speed 3g services .
cutting costs mobile technology has , for some time , been making a difference in remote , underdeveloped areas of the world where it is difficult and costly to build fixed-line infrastructure and net access .
one reason for its success is its ease of use and its ability to conveniently overcome language and literacy issues . "
i do n't want to say that there is no need for pcs .
but the problem with them is that they last for maybe one or two years then start to break down " simo hoikka , nokia un debut for $ 100 laptop net access in the traditional sense , via a computer , still needs some level of know-how , such as typing and reading skills .
the mobile , in its simplest form , requires voice only .
they were also being shared in local communities to find out market prices , and other vital information , such as medical advice .
in bangladesh , mobiles are being extensively used for e-learning , e-commerce , and e-government , and local communities there are working on making more local content available via mobile networks .
but even though two billion people have a mobile in their pocket , there was a lot of work to be done , starting with mobile manufacturers , to knock down barriers to access , said mr phillips .
the gsm association has already worked with motorola to produce an entry-level mobile handset with vastly improved battery life for under $ 30 .
but taxation and regulation policies also needed to be tackled in developing nations to ensure fair and cheap access .
some countries impose taxes on text messaging and even on handsets , and 3g licences were still too expensive , according to mr phillips .
fast connection third generation networks -lrb- 3g -rrb- are gradually being rolled out in developing nations , and already 73 % of broadband subscriptions are through 3g .
in japan , the figure stands at more than 90 % .
to speed up the roll out of 3g networks in emerging nations , harmonising the spectrum as well as technology standards was key before developing countries could take full advantage of 3g .
mr phillips recommended that countries not hold pricey auctions for 3g operator licences , but rely instead on natural growth .
he was cautious about intel 's wimax technology because he feared developing nations would feel attracted to its promises over existing mobile networks , which would erode chances of 3g expanding across the globe .
intel is keen to push into the mobile market place and is now providing the chip technology for blackberry devices .
currently , according to intel 's former ceo and current chairman , wimax is undergoing 100 trials worldwide in preparing for its commercialisation .
but , according to mr phillips , even the next generation of mobile net offering speeds of 10mbps would offer the connectivity required to narrow the digital divide .
marriage made in heaven the real opportunities for mobile technologies lie in its ability to work with other existing infrastructures that are in place already in vast expanses of countries were poles and wires can not reach .
one project by nokia , called bridgeit , is on show at the un 's world summit on the information society in tunisia this week .
it demonstrates how satellite and mobile technologies could be married to provide vital interactive e-learning for people in the philippines .
initiated in 2001 , the project has been rolled out to more than 200 schools which are completely cut off from fixed net access .
the project provides schools with nokia set-top boxes carrying 80gb of storage on board , a gsm mobile , a sim card , and a guide to interactive maths and science lessons .
through local partnerships , the sim card is prepaid , the mobiles are under $ 30 and the boxes cost an initial $ 250 .
when teachers want to access lessons , they text a unique code and the interactive material is downloaded at off-peak times to the box .
teachers then access that material in their lessons via a tv .
all the lessons have been formulated to be culturally relevant to daily life .
the video clips are three to four minutes long , and use mpeg4 encoding which compresses files efficiently .
" we could add anything to the teaching modules , " said simo hoikka from nokia .
" it can develop all the time . "
parents were also recognising that the lessons could be relevant for them too and were coming into the trial schools in the evening to do the lessons too .
mr hoikka is confident that the project will interest a lot of developing nation governments , judging by the success the pilot projects .
" there is a need for this in other south-east asian countries and africa , " he said .
" but it has to fit local cultures . "
nokia is in discussions with indonesian and indian authorities , particularly since the asian tsunami which wiped out many schools .
it was also looking to try out the systems in africa , and north african nations .
" i do n't want to say that there is no need for pcs , " he said .
" but the problem with them is that they last for maybe one or two years then start to break down .
schools have no money to fix equipment , especially in rural areas . "
eventually , he imagines children being able to share video diaries and messages with other schools around the world using the system .
education departments could also use the technology to send messages to schools , cutting out the expense of postal letters .

fast connection third generation networks -lrb- 3g -rrb- are gradually being rolled out in developing nations , and already 73 % of broadband subscriptions are through 3g .
thousands are in tunis to talk about narrowing the technology gap in japan , the figure stands at more than 90 % .
to speed up the roll out of 3g networks in emerging nations , harmonising the spectrum as well as technology standards was key before developing countries could take full advantage of 3g .
mr phillips recommended that countries not hold pricey auctions for 3g operator licences , but rely instead on natural growth .
he was cautious about intel 's wimax technology because he feared developing nations would feel attracted to its promises over existing mobile networks , which would erode chances of 3g expanding across the globe .
intel is keen to push into the mobile market place and is now providing the chip technology for blackberry devices .
currently , according to intel 's former ceo and current chairman , wimax is undergoing 100 trials worldwide in preparing for its commercialisation .
but , according to mr phillips , even the next generation of mobile net offering speeds of 10mbps would offer the connectivity required to narrow the digital divide .
marriage made in heaven the real opportunities for mobile technologies lie in its ability to work with other existing infrastructures that are in place already in vast expanses of countries were poles and wires can not reach .
one project by nokia , called bridgeit , is on show at the un 's world summit on the information society in tunisia this week .
it demonstrates how satellite and mobile technologies could be married to provide vital interactive e-learning for people in the philippines .
initiated in 2001 , the project has been rolled out to more than 200 schools which are completely cut off from fixed net access .
the nokia device offers lessons via a tv screen the project provides schools with nokia set-top boxes carrying 80gb of storage on board , a gsm mobile , a sim card , and a guide to interactive maths and science lessons .
through local partnerships , the sim card is prepaid , the mobiles are under $ 30 and the boxes cost an initial $ 250 .
when teachers want to access lessons , they text a unique code and the interactive material is downloaded at off-peak times to the box .
teachers then access that material in their lessons via a tv .
all the lessons have been formulated to be culturally relevant to daily life .
the video clips are three to four minutes long , and use mpeg4 encoding which compresses files efficiently .
" we could add anything to the teaching modules , " said simo hoikka from nokia .
" it can develop all the time . "
parents were also recognising that the lessons could be relevant for them too and were coming into the trial schools in the evening to do the lessons too .
mr hoikka is confident that the project will interest a lot of developing nation governments , judging by the success the pilot projects .
" there is a need for this in other south-east asian countries and africa , " he said .
" but it has to fit local cultures . "
nokia is in discussions with indonesian and indian authorities , particularly since the asian tsunami which wiped out many schools .
it was also looking to try out the systems in africa , and north african nations .
" i do n't want to say that there is no need for pcs , " he said .
" but the problem with them is that they last for maybe one or two years then start to break down .
schools have no money to fix equipment , especially in rural areas . "
eventually , he imagines children being able to share video diaries and messages with other schools around the world using the system .
education departments could also use the technology to send messages to schools , cutting out the expense of postal letters .

but there are those who are looking to existing mobile phone technologies as the way to connect the world .
" everyone is talking about the digital divide , but the real issue is getting phones in everyone 's hand , " tom phillips , the head of gsm association 's policy unit , told the bbc news website .
" the core message is simple ; 80 % of the world has mobile coverage yet only 25 % is accessing it , " he said while the likes of intel are pushing next-generation wireless technologies such as wimax , mr phillips said that governments should be improving existing mobile networks and rolling out high-speed 3g services .
cutting costs mobile technology has , for some time , been making a difference in remote , underdeveloped areas of the world where it is difficult and costly to build fixed-line infrastructure and net access .
one reason for its success is its ease of use and its ability to conveniently overcome language and literacy issues .
i do n't want to say that there is no need for pcs .
but the problem with them is that they last for maybe one or two years then start to break down simo hoikka , nokia un debut for $ 100 laptop net access in the traditional sense , via a computer , still needs some level of know-how , such as typing and reading skills .
the mobile , in its simplest form , requires voice only .
they were also being shared in local communities to find out market prices , and other vital information , such as medical advice .
in bangladesh , mobiles are being extensively used for e-learning , e-commerce , and e-government , and local communities there are working on making more local content available via mobile networks .
but even though two billion people have a mobile in their pocket , there was a lot of work to be done , starting with mobile manufacturers , to knock down barriers to access , said mr phillips .
the gsm association has already worked with motorola to produce an entry-level mobile handset with vastly improved battery life for under $ 30 .
but taxation and regulation policies also needed to be tackled in developing nations to ensure fair and cheap access .
some countries impose taxes on text messaging and even on handsets , and 3g licences were still too expensive , according to mr phillips .
fast connection third generation networks -lrb- 3g -rrb- are gradually being rolled out in developing nations , and already 73 % of broadband subscriptions are through 3g .
thousands are in tunis to talk about narrowing the technology gap in japan , the figure stands at more than 90 % .
to speed up the roll out of 3g networks in emerging nations , harmonising the spectrum as well as technology standards was key before developing countries could take full advantage of 3g .
mr phillips recommended that countries not hold pricey auctions for 3g operator licences , but rely instead on natural growth .
he was cautious about intel 's wimax technology because he feared developing nations would feel attracted to its promises over existing mobile networks , which would erode chances of 3g expanding across the globe .
intel is keen to push into the mobile market place and is now providing the chip technology for blackberry devices .
currently , according to intel 's former ceo and current chairman , wimax is undergoing 100 trials worldwide in preparing for its commercialisation .
but , according to mr phillips , even the next generation of mobile net offering speeds of 10mbps would offer the connectivity required to narrow the digital divide .
marriage made in heaven the real opportunities for mobile technologies lie in its ability to work with other existing infrastructures that are in place already in vast expanses of countries were poles and wires can not reach .
one project by nokia , called bridgeit , is on show at the un 's world summit on the information society in tunisia this week .
it demonstrates how satellite and mobile technologies could be married to provide vital interactive e-learning for people in the philippines .
initiated in 2001 , the project has been rolled out to more than 200 schools which are completely cut off from fixed net access .
the nokia device offers lessons via a tv screen the project provides schools with nokia set-top boxes carrying 80gb of storage on board , a gsm mobile , a sim card , and a guide to interactive maths and science lessons .
through local partnerships , the sim card is prepaid , the mobiles are under $ 30 and the boxes cost an initial $ 250 .
when teachers want to access lessons , they text a unique code and the interactive material is downloaded at off-peak times to the box .
teachers then access that material in their lessons via a tv .
all the lessons have been formulated to be culturally relevant to daily life .
the video clips are three to four minutes long , and use mpeg4 encoding which compresses files efficiently .
" we could add anything to the teaching modules , " said simo hoikka from nokia .
" it can develop all the time . "
parents were also recognising that the lessons could be relevant for them too and were coming into the trial schools in the evening to do the lessons too .
mr hoikka is confident that the project will interest a lot of developing nation governments , judging by the success the pilot projects .
" there is a need for this in other south-east asian countries and africa , " he said .
" but it has to fit local cultures . "
nokia is in discussions with indonesian and indian authorities , particularly since the asian tsunami which wiped out many schools .
it was also looking to try out the systems in africa , and north african nations .
" i do n't want to say that there is no need for pcs , " he said .
" but the problem with them is that they last for maybe one or two years then start to break down .
schools have no money to fix equipment , especially in rural areas . "
eventually , he imagines children being able to share video diaries and messages with other schools around the world using the system .
education departments could also use the technology to send messages to schools , cutting out the expense of postal letters .

through local partnerships , the sim card is prepaid , the mobiles are under $ 30 and the boxes cost an initial $ 250 .

" we could add anything to the teaching modules , " said simo hoikka from nokia .
" it can develop all the time . "

mr hoikka is confident that the project will interest a lot of developing nation governments , judging by the success the pilot projects .

but there are those who are looking to existing mobile phone technologies as the way to connect the world .
" everyone is talking about the digital divide , but the real issue is getting phones in everyone 's hand , " tom phillips , the head of gsm association 's policy unit , told the bbc news website .
" the core message is simple ; 80 % of the world has mobile coverage yet only 25 % is accessing it , " he said while the likes of intel are pushing next-generation wireless technologies such as wimax , mr phillips said that governments should be improving existing mobile networks and rolling out high-speed 3g services .
cutting costs mobile technology has , for some time , been making a difference in remote , underdeveloped areas of the world where it is difficult and costly to build fixed-line infrastructure and net access .
one reason for its success is its ease of use and its ability to conveniently overcome language and literacy issues .
i do n't want to say that there is no need for pcs .
but the problem with them is that they last for maybe one or two years then start to break down simo hoikka , nokia un debut for $ 100 laptop net access in the traditional sense , via a computer , still needs some level of know-how , such as typing and reading skills .
the mobile , in its simplest form , requires voice only .
they were also being shared in local communities to find out market prices , and other vital information , such as medical advice .
in bangladesh , mobiles are being extensively used for e-learning , e-commerce , and e-government , and local communities there are working on making more local content available via mobile networks .
but even though two billion people have a mobile in their pocket , there was a lot of work to be done , starting with mobile manufacturers , to knock down barriers to access , said mr phillips .
the gsm association has already worked with motorola to produce an entry-level mobile handset with vastly improved battery life for under $ 30 .
but taxation and regulation policies also needed to be tackled in developing nations to ensure fair and cheap access .
some countries impose taxes on text messaging and even on handsets , and 3g licences were still too expensive , according to mr phillips .
fast connection third generation networks -lrb- 3g -rrb- are gradually being rolled out in developing nations , and already 73 % of broadband subscriptions are through 3g .
thousands are in tunis to talk about narrowing the technology gap in japan , the figure stands at more than 90 % .
to speed up the roll out of 3g networks in emerging nations , harmonising the spectrum as well as technology standards was key before developing countries could take full advantage of 3g .
mr phillips recommended that countries not hold pricey auctions for 3g operator licences , but rely instead on natural growth .
he was cautious about intel 's wimax technology because he feared developing nations would feel attracted to its promises over existing mobile networks , which would erode chances of 3g expanding across the globe .
intel is keen to push into the mobile market place and is now providing the chip technology for blackberry devices .
currently , according to intel 's former ceo and current chairman , wimax is undergoing 100 trials worldwide in preparing for its commercialisation .
but , according to mr phillips , even the next generation of mobile net offering speeds of 10mbps would offer the connectivity required to narrow the digital divide .
marriage made in heaven the real opportunities for mobile technologies lie in its ability to work with other existing infrastructures that are in place already in vast expanses of countries were poles and wires can not reach .
one project by nokia , called bridgeit , is on show at the un 's world summit on the information society in tunisia this week .
it demonstrates how satellite and mobile technologies could be married to provide vital interactive e-learning for people in the philippines .
initiated in 2001 , the project has been rolled out to more than 200 schools which are completely cut off from fixed net access .
the nokia device offers lessons via a tv screen the project provides schools with nokia set-top boxes carrying 80gb of storage on board , a gsm mobile , a sim card , and a guide to interactive maths and science lessons .

the president made his appeal at the un world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- in tunis .
the meeting is discussing ways of narrowing the technology gap between rich and poor .
but money remains a contentious issue , with many richer nations cautious about providing more aid .
president wade spearheaded efforts for a so-called digital solidarity fund in 2003 at the first stage of wsis in geneva .
he also proposed a 1 % digital tax on all computers bought everywhere that would go towards efforts to get equipment into countries that needed it most .
the fund was eventually set up and has been up and running for four months .
but it is entirely voluntary and so far has only raised 7m euros -lrb- £ 4.7m -rrb- .
only nine of its 22 members are countries and just one of these , france , is outside of africa .
' win-win ' " it is clear that the private sector can not overcome all our problems , " said president wade .
" we in africa have taken the initiative to create the necessary infrastructure so that the private sector can come in , for example in telecoms , " he told a news conference in tunis . "
it is better to be on the last coach of that train than not to be on it at all .
now we must move up the coaches " abdoulaye wade , senegalese president pocket answer to divide he said the fund was a " win-win " situation for everyone because businesses in the west would ultimately benefit from the millions that could then be spent on buying equipment from them .
even though more than 190 states have pledged support for the fund , which is managed by volunteers in geneva , few had donated the $ 300,000 to join the fund .
" true solidarity is amongst men , not states , " said president wade , reminding delegates that africa was still desperately disconnected from the world .
every time new software was created , he said , the gap widened .
but with the assistance of the fund as it stood , equipment was already being bought for schools and local communities .
the senegalese leader likened africa 's level of inclusion to being on a train .
" it is better to be on the last coach of that train than not to be on it at all .
now we must move up the coaches , " he said .
have your say " under the current system , the us government can easily " shut down " the internet service of any country it has a conflict with " edward leung , hong kong send us your comments he recognised however that training was just as important as hardware , for any progress to be sustainable .
the thorny issue of net governance raised its head too , with president wade expressing concern that the issue had not been fully resolved at the summit .
although he did not support the un taking over governance of the net , he said : " we need to define a space that manages domains , but allows for democratic participation . "
he also called for a charter to protect human dignity and rights in the information society and touched on the need to prevent the " brain drain " from african nations .
wary west the digital solidarity fund has already had some success in africa .
un debut for $ 100 laptop broadband access is now in place at hiv / aids clinics in burkina faso to give patients access to much-needed information , for example .
president wade reiterated that the appeal for more support was to developing nations too .
he said senegal and nigeria had recently injected $ 500,000 into the piggy bank .
dakar was also working to set up a centre to whip up support for it .
but there remains scepticism from some developed countries because it is a stand-alone initiative , separate from well-established organisations such as the world bank .
the issue of how to finance global efforts to close the technology gap between rich and poorer nations has been largely unaddressed at the summit , that ends on friday .

one project , gulliver 's world , is not the type of initiative that the governments of developing nations will be throwing money at to take to the masses just yet .
not least because the virtual reality technology it adapts is not widely used in many developed nations .
originally designed for the museum of the future at austria 's ars electronica center , the prototype 3d virtual reality table top and video screen set-up tries to blur boundaries between computerised and real worlds .
it was a surprise to find the project buried in the middle of stands which feature small-scale , sometimes low-tech , grass roots initiatives from india , africa , and asia .
but gulliver 's world is in the expo because it was a winner of the world summit prize for the best e-entertainment project .

a camera fitted with sensors detects the position of objects on an interactive table top and translates that to the virtual earth projected on a big screen .
players record themselves with a video camera and the recording is then put inside a virtual box .
they then use the interactive table and physical , movable boxes to control their characters and interact with others on-screen .

it may seem completely unconnected to the plight of developing nations struggling to get local communities connected to the net .
but one can see the potential , as with so many of these types of art-based projects , for creativity .
it would add an entirely new dimension to video blogging and google earth , for example .
the system is also designed to explain what computers and technology can do , as opposed to what they are .
" the problem we have in digital life is that we can not touch or smell data , " explained dr stocker .
working with sensor technology such as this means data is no longer trapped behind screen and keyboard .
when children come to the table , they immediately " get it " and start to produce their own stories within the virtual world .

the kent seafront site has been sold to a developer who wants to build shops , flats , a hotel and restaurants .
but a report following a public inquiry last year says dreamland should stay an amusement park with its listed scenic railway roller coaster protected .
" it is better than we could have expected , " said spokesman nick laister .
" we are absolutely delighted .
the inspector seems to have accepted every single one of the points we made at the inquiry .
everybody wants to see a use for dreamland that is an asset for margate colin fitt " he has quite unequivocally stated that dreamland should remain as an amusement park . "
the park , which opened in the 1920s , was open for the 2005 season .
but a planning application was expected to be submitted by the margate town centre regeneration company in 2006 .
alternative plans drawn up by international theme park designer jean-marc toussaint have been adopted by the save dreamland campaign .
as well as the dreamland site , the public inquiry looked at all aspects of thanet council 's local plan for the district 's development until 2011 .
the inspector also rejected the council 's proposal for housing on land near the moses montefiore synagogue in ramsgate .
' broadly pleased ' however , thanet 's development manager colin fitt said he was broadly pleased with the 550 page report .
" we had a public inquiry that lasted for almost six months and it was inevitable that the inspector was going to disagree with the council 's strategy on one or two particular sites , " he said .
" everybody wants to see a use for dreamland that is an asset for margate and the council is going to have to consider the inspector 's words very carefully . "
he said the local plan set out policies to protect thanet 's beaches and countryside , which the inspector acknowledged were the right strategy .

the kent seafront site has been sold to a developer who wants to build shops , flats , a hotel and restaurants .
but a report following a public inquiry last year says dreamland should stay an amusement park with its listed scenic railway roller coaster protected .
" it is better than we could have expected , " said spokesman nick laister .
" we are absolutely delighted .
the inspector seems to have accepted every single one of the points we made at the inquiry .
everybody wants to see a use for dreamland that is an asset for margate colin fitt " he has quite unequivocally stated that dreamland should remain as an amusement park . "
the park , which opened in the 1920s , was open for the 2005 season .
but a planning application was expected to be submitted by the margate town centre regeneration company in 2006 .
alternative plans drawn up by international theme park designer jean-marc toussaint have been adopted by the save dreamland campaign .
as well as the dreamland site , the public inquiry looked at all aspects of thanet council 's local plan for the district 's development until 2011 .
the inspector also rejected the council 's proposal for housing on land near the moses montefiore synagogue in ramsgate .
' broadly pleased ' however , thanet 's development manager colin fitt said he was broadly pleased with the 550 page report .
" we had a public inquiry that lasted for almost six months and it was inevitable that the inspector was going to disagree with the council 's strategy on one or two particular sites , " he said .
" everybody wants to see a use for dreamland that is an asset for margate and the council is going to have to consider the inspector 's words very carefully . "

i have a passion for tolerance .
not just the tolerance for the great sweep of racial , sexual preference and faith , but the small things .
what saddens me is when you hear demands that something - insert almost anything you can imagine - is " banned " .
somehow if only that small thing were to happen , the world would be a better place , children would dance in the streets ...
but what the writers often focus on is the transient and frivolous .
yes , fireworks let off late at night are annoying , but in the great scheme of things they 're not the end of the world .

bleak lives surely it is better to think beyond the small and encourage tolerance .
we need to respect others and consider their needs , but that does n't mean living bleak lives shorn of any risk or fun .

another tactic is to think about why someone is doing what he is doing .

the worse thing to do is take a trivial annoyance personally .

you notice him ; he glances up from his work ; was that a slight smile on his face ?

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- politics show -pipe- south west : tallow tale bbc news / politics show graphics version bbc sport home politics show -pipe- archive -pipe- contact us -pipe- faqs -pipe- interviews -pipe- meet the team -pipe- friday , 18 november 2005 , 09:41 gmt south west : tallow tale scott bingham politics show south west there are fears that new european laws on waste disposal could cost the meat industry millions of pounds and damage the environment .
the uk is just one of just three eu member states to designate rendered animal fat , or tallow , as waste rather than a fuel .
and the industry is warning the move could have huge implications .
meat is big business - and few uk processors are bigger than cornwall 's st merryn meat .
its bodmin plant can handle more than 1700 cattle a week - taking in live animals at one end and producing meat for major supermarkets at the other .
along with the rest of the industry they 've had their fair share of knocks in recent years , but things were looking up .
annual turnover is around £ 300m , but now new european legislation looks set to hit them hard once again .
" the increased costs to our business will be huge , " said st merryn livestock director john dracup .
" for st merryn alone we are talking about £ 1.3m a year and we believe to our industry the increased cost will be in the region of £ 35m , which we can little afford at the moment . "
processors like st merryn meat pay for by-products - essentially the parts of the carcass which are not used as meat - to be taken away and disposed of at rendering plants .
here those by-products are processed to produce two end products - firstly , bone meal , which can be used in anything from fertilisers to animal feed and secondly rendered animal fat , or tallow .
tallow is used in a multitude of products , from food to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals .
up until now it has also been used as a bio-fuel .
" in most cases rendering plants have produced enough tallow that they are able to use it to fuel their steam boilers or thermo oxidisers , " said stephen woodgate , of the uk renderers ' association .
" in recent time we have produced more than we need and we have been able to sell the excess to power stations . "
but that is about to change .
from 1 january 2006 the uk is one of just three of the 25 eu member states set to designate tallow as waste rather than fuel under the waste incineration directive .
renderers say that , as the will be unable to afford the £ 300,000 cost to modify their equipment to meet the requirements of the directive , they will be forced to revert to burning fossil fuels .
" here at this plant that will mean we will be putting 15,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere each year , " says steve woodgate .
" that can not be right " .
a defra spokesman said there is as yet no ban on the burning of tallow from 1 january 2006 .
" the government has neither designated tallow as waste nor banned its use as a fuel .
however , we are aware of the concerns being expressed by the rendering industry .
" their concerns are being taken seriously and we are working hard to find a solution , " he said .
south west mep neil parish called on the government to follow the 22 other eu members who have not designated tallow as waste .
" the situation is nonsensical .
the framing of the directive is wrong and we would be wrong to implement it .
we need to hold off and get this sorted out , " he said .
hopes of a review are high .
but if this goes ahead , any increased financial costs will undoubtedly be shared between the producers and the pockets of the consumer , but with the government under pressure to reduce carbon dioxide emissions the cost to us all could be far greater .

renderers say that , as the will be unable to afford the £ 300,000 cost to modify their equipment to meet the requirements of the directive , they will be forced to revert to burning fossil fuels .
" here at this plant that will mean we will be putting 15,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere each year , " says steve woodgate .
" that can not be right " .
a defra spokesman said there is as yet no ban on the burning of tallow from 1 january 2006 .
" the government has neither designated tallow as waste nor banned its use as a fuel .
however , we are aware of the concerns being expressed by the rendering industry .
" their concerns are being taken seriously and we are working hard to find a solution , " he said .
south west mep neil parish called on the government to follow the 22 other eu members who have not designated tallow as waste .
" the situation is nonsensical .
the framing of the directive is wrong and we would be wrong to implement it .
we need to hold off and get this sorted out , " he said .
hopes of a review are high .
but if this goes ahead , any increased financial costs will undoubtedly be shared between the producers and the pockets of the consumer , but with the government under pressure to reduce carbon dioxide emissions the cost to us all could be far greater .

the uk is just one of just three eu member states to designate rendered animal fat , or tallow , as waste rather than a fuel .
and the industry is warning the move could have huge implications .
meat is big business - and few uk processors are bigger than cornwall 's st merryn meat .
its bodmin plant can handle more than 1700 cattle a week - taking in live animals at one end and producing meat for major supermarkets at the other .
along with the rest of the industry they 've had their fair share of knocks in recent years , but things were looking up .
annual turnover is around £ 300m , but now new european legislation looks set to hit them hard once again .
" the increased costs to our business will be huge , " said st merryn livestock director john dracup .
" for st merryn alone we are talking about £ 1.3m a year and we believe to our industry the increased cost will be in the region of £ 35m , which we can little afford at the moment . "
processors like st merryn meat pay for by-products - essentially the parts of the carcass which are not used as meat - to be taken away and disposed of at rendering plants .
here those by-products are processed to produce two end products - firstly , bone meal , which can be used in anything from fertilisers to animal feed and secondly rendered animal fat , or tallow .
tallow is used in a multitude of products , from food to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals .
up until now it has also been used as a bio-fuel .
" in most cases rendering plants have produced enough tallow that they are able to use it to fuel their steam boilers or thermo oxidisers , " said stephen woodgate , of the uk renderers ' association .
" in recent time we have produced more than we need and we have been able to sell the excess to power stations . "
but that is about to change .

the government has finally decided on the launch date after the packs were made law by the housing act a year ago .
buyers will be provided with a survey , land registry details and answers from both the sellers and local authority to standard questions .
the government says the packs will cost about £ 600 plus vat and will make home buying quicker and cheaper .
the idea of introducing such packs has been discussed in the industry since the early 1990s .
saving money the conveyancing system in england and wales is widely regarded as unnecessarily slow and expensive .
in particular , would-be buyers can spend hundreds of pounds on surveys and other enquiries only to find their money has been wasted because the proposed property sale has fallen through .
yvette cooper , the housing minister , stressed that the aim of the packs was to eradicate this problem : " currently one million pounds a day is wasted on failed transactions as buyers often spend hundreds of pounds on valuations , legal advice and searches on transactions that ultimately break down . "
not only should the packs reduce the total amount of money wasted on abortive transactions , it should cut the number of such transactions as well .
buyers will be able to see a report on the property 's condition right from the start , not several weeks later after paying for their own survey .
home inspectors one feature of the forthcoming system is that the government estimates that up to 7,400 people in the property industry , such as surveyors , building inspectors or estate agents , will have to qualify as home inspectors .
only then will they have the legal authority to compile the surveys , known as home condition reports , which will form the core of the sellers ' packs .
these reports will be " level 2 " or mid-survey reports .
that means they will be fuller than the minimal valuation reports that most people currently rely on when buying a house .
but they wo n't be as detailed as the full surveyors ' reports which currently are paid for by only 3 % of home buyers .
the date for launching the packs was criticised by the council of mortgage lenders -lrb- cml -rrb- , worried that it might produce an artificial rush of house sellers trying to save money by putting their properties on the market before the deadline .
the cml said : " this will coincide with the housing market busy period , and could result in some unwelcome effects during the transition to the new regime . "
