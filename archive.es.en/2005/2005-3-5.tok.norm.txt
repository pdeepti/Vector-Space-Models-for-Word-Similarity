but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .
it is a matter of hit and miss sometimes , but both esa and nasa said that the discovery of xmmu j.2235.3-2557 " might just be the tip of the iceberg .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart adam rotfeld will make a joint trip to the ukrainian capital of kiev on march 21 to send a signal of support to ukraine just months after the country ushered in democracy following popular protests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa lipowicz , left , co-chairwoman of the polish-german team for regional cooperation , german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , and polish foreign minister adam rotfeld , right , jointly shake hands after their meeting in warsaw , poland .
at a press conference during fischer 's one-day trip to warsaw on friday , the two ministers said that they were going to kiev to let the ukrainians know they would n't be left alone and that they intended to help ukraine in building democracy . " we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .
" we are very interested in progress in the country 's democratic and economic development , " said fischer . poland has also been an advocate of quickly opening eu membership talks with ukraine .
the eu has intensified cooperation with kiev , but has not offered to open accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rally in support of viktor yushchenko as part of efforts to strengthen the democratic process in ukraine , fischer and rotfeld proposed a series of measures including providing training for officials in the ukrainian government .
" it 's essential to train specialists in local government who are essential to the proper functioning of civil society , " said rotfeld . the two countries also plan to increase the number of stipends available in their countries for ukrainian students , and creating a " european university " on the polish-ukrainian border . visa scandal casts shadow on ties but , despite germany 's backing of democracy in ukraine , relations between berlin and kiev have suffered recently following revelations of a massive illegal immigrant scandal in the german foreign ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait in front of the german embassy in kiev for a visa .
joschka fischer stands accused of turning a blind eye to massive visa abuse between 2000 and 2002 , particularly at the german embassy in kiev , which resulted in an unusually high flood of foreign nationals , many of them ukrainians , entering germany .
in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .
" we are very interested in progress in the country 's democratic and economic development , " said fischer . poland has also been an advocate of quickly opening eu membership talks with ukraine .
the eu has intensified cooperation with kiev , but has not offered to open accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rally in support of viktor yushchenko as part of efforts to strengthen the democratic process in ukraine , fischer and rotfeld proposed a series of measures including providing training for officials in the ukrainian government .
" it 's essential to train specialists in local government who are essential to the proper functioning of civil society , " said rotfeld . the two countries also plan to increase the number of stipends available in their countries for ukrainian students , and creating a " european university " on the polish-ukrainian border . visa scandal casts shadow on ties but , despite germany 's backing of democracy in ukraine , relations between berlin and kiev have suffered recently following revelations of a massive illegal immigrant scandal in the german foreign ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait in front of the german embassy in kiev for a visa .
joschka fischer stands accused of turning a blind eye to massive visa abuse between 2000 and 2002 , particularly at the german embassy in kiev , which resulted in an unusually high flood of foreign nationals , many of them ukrainians , entering germany .
in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .

ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .
oh , yes .

that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .

" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.03.2005 german researchers discover galaxy cluster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oldest galaxy cluster yet discovered : xmmu j2235.3-2557 scientists will have to alter their theories about the big bang - german astronomers have discovered a cluster of galaxies that suggests the universe evolved into its present form far sooner than was thought . the search for new galaxies must be a tedious and often thankless task for astronomers .
but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .
it is a matter of hit and miss sometimes , but both esa and nasa said that the discovery of xmmu j.2235.3-2557 " might just be the tip of the iceberg .

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 berlin , scandinavian art capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic artists : part of berlin 's vibrant art scene the roughly 6,200 danes , finns , icelanders , norwegians and swedes who 've made berlin their home may not stand out in the three-million-strong city .
but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .
from feb .
24 - march 21 , a series of over 100 events , including films , performances , exhibitions and concerts is showing visitors what the nordic neighbors have been doing since they made berlin their home away from home . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig , the art world 's new mecca all of a sudden , a group of artists that passed through leipzig 's academy of visual arts is the toast of the collecting world .

for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .
oh , yes .
the quiz .
in 1998 , mclaren-mercedes with mika hakkinen and david coulthard beat ferrari with michael schumacher and eddie irvine . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who can break schumacher 's grip on f1 ?
the 2005 formula one season looms large with winter training already underway .
last season was another record breaking campaign for a certain german driver and the question remains , can anyone beat michael schumacher ?
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- schumacher 's surprise injuries land him in pit stop doctors have ordered german racing star ralf schumacher off the racetrack for 12 weeks after discovering broken vertebrae following his spectacular crash 10 days ago in indianapolis .

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted .

when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '

" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 who 's afraid of michael schumacher ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ill will , but fans might like to see schumacher be toppled the race for the formula 1 crown starts on sunday with the australian grand prix , and michael schumacher is expecting a difficult start .
that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .
oh , yes .
the quiz .
in 1998 , mclaren-mercedes with mika hakkinen and david coulthard beat ferrari with michael schumacher and eddie irvine . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who can break schumacher 's grip on f1 ?
the 2005 formula one season looms large with winter training already underway .
last season was another record breaking campaign for a certain german driver and the question remains , can anyone beat michael schumacher ?
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- schumacher 's surprise injuries land him in pit stop doctors have ordered german racing star ralf schumacher off the racetrack for 12 weeks after discovering broken vertebrae following his spectacular crash 10 days ago in indianapolis .

copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .
from feb .
24 - march 21 , a series of over 100 events , including films , performances , exhibitions and concerts is showing visitors what the nordic neighbors have been doing since they made berlin their home away from home . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig , the art world 's new mecca all of a sudden , a group of artists that passed through leipzig 's academy of visual arts is the toast of the collecting world .

that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .

she had been given emergency treatment in a us military hospital in baghdad . " they -lrb- the kidnappers -rrb- never treated me badly but i wish things had gone better last night , " the exhausted journalist told colleagues of left-wing daily il manifesto who greeted her inside the plane .
she was the paper 's correspondent in iraq when she was kidnapped in baghdad a month ago . the 56-year-old veteran middle east reporter was greeted at rome 's ciampino airport by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who boarded the plane as it came to a halt . the body of italian secret service agent nicola calipari , 51 , who was killed throwing his body in front of sgrena to protect her from gunfire as their car neared a us checkpoint at baghdad airport , was due to return later saturday .
a military plane repatriating his body left the iraqi capital as sgrena was arriving in rome .
berlusconi was expected to pay his respects to the arriving agent . sgrena was hit in the shoulder and lung when us troops opened fire on the convoy taking her to baghdad airport , killing calipari .
the us military said the convoy had ignored signals to stop , and that us soldiers had waved their hands and arms , flashed white lights and fired warning shots in a failed attempt to get the vehicle to stop . sgrena was put under sedatives " because she is in a lot of pain , " said her brother who was at the airport to greet her .
" giuliana will undergo surgery for her fractured left collarbone , " said il manifesto chief editor gabriele polo .
" the bullet which possibly killed nicola calipari was removed -lrb- from her shoulder -rrb- last night , " he added . bush apologizes to berlusconi amid anger in italy at the violent end to sgrena 's month-long ordeal , us president george w. bush has promised a full investigation into the incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi us president george w. bush called italian prime minister silvio berlusconi from the us presidential jet air force one late friday " to express his regret about the incident that occurred earlier today , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said in washington . " the president assured prime minister berlusconi that the incident will be fully investigated , " mcclellan said , adding that the two spoke for about five minutes .
sgrena " was fired upon by coalition forces .
apparently there was the loss of one life , an italian citizen , and she was also injured in the incident , " mcclellan said .
" we regret the loss of life , the italian citizen who lost his life , and obviously she is in our thoughts and prayers as well . " berlusconi , a staunch ally of bush , told a press conference in rome late friday there were " disquieting questions " that needed to be answered about the incident .
" several shots hit the car .
one man was mortally wounded by a bullet .
we are petrified and dumbfounded by this fatality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giuliana sgrena berlusconi said an agent had thrown his body in front of sgrena -lrb- photo -rrb- to protect her from the shots but was fatally wounded .
" it is a pity .
this was a joyful moment which made all our fellow citizens happy , which has been transformed into profound pain by the death of a person who behaved so bravely . " anger in rome " like all italians we now expect the united states to explain this painful and tragic incident , " said italian president carlo azeglio ciampi . foreign minister gianfranco fini said he hoped calipari 's death would not trigger anti-american sentiment in italy .
" this was a macabre joke of destiny ; a tragedy decided by fate , " he told daily corriere della sera . sgrena was kidnapped in baghdad february 4 by an iraqi group who called on rome to withdraw its troops from iraq . details of the release were not known saturday . she had been shown pleading for her life in a video released by her kidnappers two weeks after her kidnapping in baghdad .
sobbing and looking thinner , she delivered an impassioned message begging rome to withdraw its troops from iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in milan attend a rally to ask the release of italian journalist of leftist newspaper " il manifesto " giuliana sgrena on feb .

berlusconi 's centre-right government rejected the plea , and on the same day used its majority to ensure the italian senate voted to extend the mission of rome 's 3,000 troops in iraq .
a few days after the video was shown , an estimated half a million people marched in rome to demand her release . sgrena 's newspaper , the rome-based communist daily il manifesto , is a bitter opponent of the us-led invasion of iraq .
the journalist also contributes to german weekly die zeit . meanwhile in france , journalists at the left-wing daily liberation were hopeful that sgrena 's release could spell good news for its own correspondent , florence aubenas , abducted two months ago in baghdad . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french reporters freed in iraq two french journalists held hostage in iraq for the past four months were freed tuesday , officials said , sparking jubilation among relatives who called it " the most beautiful christmas present ever .

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .
from feb .
24 - march 21 , a series of over 100 events , including films , performances , exhibitions and concerts is showing visitors what the nordic neighbors have been doing since they made berlin their home away from home . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig , the art world 's new mecca all of a sudden , a group of artists that passed through leipzig 's academy of visual arts is the toast of the collecting world .

she had been given emergency treatment in a us military hospital in baghdad . " they -lrb- the kidnappers -rrb- never treated me badly but i wish things had gone better last night , " the exhausted journalist told colleagues of left-wing daily il manifesto who greeted her inside the plane .
she was the paper 's correspondent in iraq when she was kidnapped in baghdad a month ago . the 56-year-old veteran middle east reporter was greeted at rome 's ciampino airport by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who boarded the plane as it came to a halt . the body of italian secret service agent nicola calipari , 51 , who was killed throwing his body in front of sgrena to protect her from gunfire as their car neared a us checkpoint at baghdad airport , was due to return later saturday .
a military plane repatriating his body left the iraqi capital as sgrena was arriving in rome .
berlusconi was expected to pay his respects to the arriving agent . sgrena was hit in the shoulder and lung when us troops opened fire on the convoy taking her to baghdad airport , killing calipari .
the us military said the convoy had ignored signals to stop , and that us soldiers had waved their hands and arms , flashed white lights and fired warning shots in a failed attempt to get the vehicle to stop . sgrena was put under sedatives " because she is in a lot of pain , " said her brother who was at the airport to greet her .
" giuliana will undergo surgery for her fractured left collarbone , " said il manifesto chief editor gabriele polo .

" the president assured prime minister berlusconi that the incident will be fully investigated , " mcclellan said , adding that the two spoke for about five minutes .
sgrena " was fired upon by coalition forces .
apparently there was the loss of one life , an italian citizen , and she was also injured in the incident , " mcclellan said .
" we regret the loss of life , the italian citizen who lost his life , and obviously she is in our thoughts and prayers as well . " berlusconi , a staunch ally of bush , told a press conference in rome late friday there were " disquieting questions " that needed to be answered about the incident .

" anger in rome " like all italians we now expect the united states to explain this painful and tragic incident , " said italian president carlo azeglio ciampi . foreign minister gianfranco fini said he hoped calipari 's death would not trigger anti-american sentiment in italy .
" this was a macabre joke of destiny ; a tragedy decided by fate , " he told daily corriere della sera . sgrena was kidnapped in baghdad february 4 by an iraqi group who called on rome to withdraw its troops from iraq . details of the release were not known saturday . she had been shown pleading for her life in a video released by her kidnappers two weeks after her kidnapping in baghdad .

a few days after the video was shown , an estimated half a million people marched in rome to demand her release . sgrena 's newspaper , the rome-based communist daily il manifesto , is a bitter opponent of the us-led invasion of iraq .
the journalist also contributes to german weekly die zeit . meanwhile in france , journalists at the left-wing daily liberation were hopeful that sgrena 's release could spell good news for its own correspondent , florence aubenas , abducted two months ago in baghdad . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french reporters freed in iraq two french journalists held hostage in iraq for the past four months were freed tuesday , officials said , sparking jubilation among relatives who called it " the most beautiful christmas present ever .

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .

she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .
from feb .
24 - march 21 , a series of over 100 events , including films , performances , exhibitions and concerts is showing visitors what the nordic neighbors have been doing since they made berlin their home away from home . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig , the art world 's new mecca all of a sudden , a group of artists that passed through leipzig 's academy of visual arts is the toast of the collecting world .

that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.03.2005 german researchers discover galaxy cluster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oldest galaxy cluster yet discovered : xmmu j2235.3-2557 scientists will have to alter their theories about the big bang - german astronomers have discovered a cluster of galaxies that suggests the universe evolved into its present form far sooner than was thought . the search for new galaxies must be a tedious and often thankless task for astronomers .
but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .
it is a matter of hit and miss sometimes , but both esa and nasa said that the discovery of xmmu j.2235.3-2557 " might just be the tip of the iceberg .

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .
it is a matter of hit and miss sometimes , but both esa and nasa said that the discovery of xmmu j.2235.3-2557 " might just be the tip of the iceberg .

that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .
oh , yes .
the quiz .
in 1998 , mclaren-mercedes with mika hakkinen and david coulthard beat ferrari with michael schumacher and eddie irvine . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who can break schumacher 's grip on f1 ?
the 2005 formula one season looms large with winter training already underway .
last season was another record breaking campaign for a certain german driver and the question remains , can anyone beat michael schumacher ?
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- schumacher 's surprise injuries land him in pit stop doctors have ordered german racing star ralf schumacher off the racetrack for 12 weeks after discovering broken vertebrae following his spectacular crash 10 days ago in indianapolis .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states says the country is " cynically " manipulating a loophole in the npt , and has threatened to take the matter to the security council to seek international sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian clergyman chants slogans during a protest to denounce iran 's pledge to open its nuclear program to unfettered inspections and suspend uranium enrichment .
if washington brings the issue before the security council , " iran will retract all the decisions it has made and the confidence-building measures it has taken , " rowhani said .
he added that iran 's leaders " could be called upon to make new decisions " , but did not provide any details on what that would involve .
" the stability in the region would become fragile and the united states would be the first to suffer , " he said . eu tries carrot and stick approach the eu is seeking a permanent halt to uranium enrichment , a process which can provide both nuclear fuel for civilian power plants and be used in the making of nuclear bombs .
in return for a permanent halt , the eu is offering iran a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels .
but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .
" the goal is research , it 's a peaceful goal , " he said , adding : " we are not seeking to produce plutonium for military use . "
he said the construction would be completed by 2008 . the iaea last year asked iran to refrain from building the reactor amid concerns about the proliferation risk , as the reactor could produce 8-10 kilograms of plutonium per year , enough to make at least one nuclear bomb annually . iran has rejected an offer from the european union to help it get a light-water research reactor in exchange for giving up its heavy-water project . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .

but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 berlin , scandinavian art capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic artists : part of berlin 's vibrant art scene the roughly 6,200 danes , finns , icelanders , norwegians and swedes who 've made berlin their home may not stand out in the three-million-strong city .
but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .
from feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 who 's afraid of michael schumacher ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ill will , but fans might like to see schumacher be toppled the race for the formula 1 crown starts on sunday with the australian grand prix , and michael schumacher is expecting a difficult start .
that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .
oh , yes .
the quiz .
in 1998 , mclaren-mercedes with mika hakkinen and david coulthard beat ferrari with michael schumacher and eddie irvine . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who can break schumacher 's grip on f1 ?

the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .
it is a matter of hit and miss sometimes , but both esa and nasa said that the discovery of xmmu j.2235.3-2557 " might just be the tip of the iceberg .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states says the country is " cynically " manipulating a loophole in the npt , and has threatened to take the matter to the security council to seek international sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian clergyman chants slogans during a protest to denounce iran 's pledge to open its nuclear program to unfettered inspections and suspend uranium enrichment .
if washington brings the issue before the security council , " iran will retract all the decisions it has made and the confidence-building measures it has taken , " rowhani said .
he added that iran 's leaders " could be called upon to make new decisions " , but did not provide any details on what that would involve .
" the stability in the region would become fragile and the united states would be the first to suffer , " he said . eu tries carrot and stick approach the eu is seeking a permanent halt to uranium enrichment , a process which can provide both nuclear fuel for civilian power plants and be used in the making of nuclear bombs .
in return for a permanent halt , the eu is offering iran a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels .
but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .
" the goal is research , it 's a peaceful goal , " he said , adding : " we are not seeking to produce plutonium for military use . "
he said the construction would be completed by 2008 . the iaea last year asked iran to refrain from building the reactor amid concerns about the proliferation risk , as the reactor could produce 8-10 kilograms of plutonium per year , enough to make at least one nuclear bomb annually . iran has rejected an offer from the european union to help it get a light-water research reactor in exchange for giving up its heavy-water project . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.03.2005 pushing for islam in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german schools already offer islamic classes in german germany 's many muslim groups plan to unite under one umbrella in an effort to ensure that islam can be taught in public schools , better integrating children and combating the influence of fundamentalists . " it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .
for a few years , muslims in some states have been trying to mount initiatives of their own but without great success . in bavaria , islamic instruction classes were set up in the 1980s but were only available in the turkish language .
similar efforts were made in schleswig-holstein and the city-states of hamburg and berlin . a promising experiment since august 2003 , muslim associations in lower saxony have come together under a shura -lrb- council -rrb- to work out how to interact with the authorities and structure courses in islam . " the experiment has been promising , " said bernd knopf , a spokesman at the federal office for integration .
but an estimated 4,500 religious instructors will probably be needed . " the problem is that we ca n't massively bring thousands of teachers into the country from one day to the next , " said knopf . some teachers are being trained in turkey under an accord between universities from both countries , but in germany itself the first-ever faculty aimed at completing such a task was only opened last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .
it 's one part of a 20-point strategy for fighting extremism and promoting integration .

24 , 2004 -rrb- the battle for german muslim minds police raids on islamic schools may shake up fundamentalist cells , but officials agree that the right teachers are the best way to root out radical islamic leanings among germany 's muslim youth .
-lrb- july 27 , 2004 -rrb- when faith is more important than school german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population .

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .
for a few years , muslims in some states have been trying to mount initiatives of their own but without great success . in bavaria , islamic instruction classes were set up in the 1980s but were only available in the turkish language .
similar efforts were made in schleswig-holstein and the city-states of hamburg and berlin . a promising experiment since august 2003 , muslim associations in lower saxony have come together under a shura -lrb- council -rrb- to work out how to interact with the authorities and structure courses in islam . " the experiment has been promising , " said bernd knopf , a spokesman at the federal office for integration .
but an estimated 4,500 religious instructors will probably be needed . " the problem is that we ca n't massively bring thousands of teachers into the country from one day to the next , " said knopf . some teachers are being trained in turkey under an accord between universities from both countries , but in germany itself the first-ever faculty aimed at completing such a task was only opened last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states says the country is " cynically " manipulating a loophole in the npt , and has threatened to take the matter to the security council to seek international sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian clergyman chants slogans during a protest to denounce iran 's pledge to open its nuclear program to unfettered inspections and suspend uranium enrichment .
if washington brings the issue before the security council , " iran will retract all the decisions it has made and the confidence-building measures it has taken , " rowhani said .
he added that iran 's leaders " could be called upon to make new decisions " , but did not provide any details on what that would involve .
" the stability in the region would become fragile and the united states would be the first to suffer , " he said . eu tries carrot and stick approach the eu is seeking a permanent halt to uranium enrichment , a process which can provide both nuclear fuel for civilian power plants and be used in the making of nuclear bombs .
in return for a permanent halt , the eu is offering iran a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels .
but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .
" the goal is research , it 's a peaceful goal , " he said , adding : " we are not seeking to produce plutonium for military use . "
he said the construction would be completed by 2008 . the iaea last year asked iran to refrain from building the reactor amid concerns about the proliferation risk , as the reactor could produce 8-10 kilograms of plutonium per year , enough to make at least one nuclear bomb annually . iran has rejected an offer from the european union to help it get a light-water research reactor in exchange for giving up its heavy-water project . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

she had been given emergency treatment in a us military hospital in baghdad . " they -lrb- the kidnappers -rrb- never treated me badly but i wish things had gone better last night , " the exhausted journalist told colleagues of left-wing daily il manifesto who greeted her inside the plane .
she was the paper 's correspondent in iraq when she was kidnapped in baghdad a month ago . the 56-year-old veteran middle east reporter was greeted at rome 's ciampino airport by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who boarded the plane as it came to a halt . the body of italian secret service agent nicola calipari , 51 , who was killed throwing his body in front of sgrena to protect her from gunfire as their car neared a us checkpoint at baghdad airport , was due to return later saturday .
a military plane repatriating his body left the iraqi capital as sgrena was arriving in rome .
berlusconi was expected to pay his respects to the arriving agent . sgrena was hit in the shoulder and lung when us troops opened fire on the convoy taking her to baghdad airport , killing calipari .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart adam rotfeld will make a joint trip to the ukrainian capital of kiev on march 21 to send a signal of support to ukraine just months after the country ushered in democracy following popular protests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa lipowicz , left , co-chairwoman of the polish-german team for regional cooperation , german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , and polish foreign minister adam rotfeld , right , jointly shake hands after their meeting in warsaw , poland .

" we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .

joschka fischer stands accused of turning a blind eye to massive visa abuse between 2000 and 2002 , particularly at the german embassy in kiev , which resulted in an unusually high flood of foreign nationals , many of them ukrainians , entering germany .
in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart adam rotfeld will make a joint trip to the ukrainian capital of kiev on march 21 to send a signal of support to ukraine just months after the country ushered in democracy following popular protests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa lipowicz , left , co-chairwoman of the polish-german team for regional cooperation , german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , and polish foreign minister adam rotfeld , right , jointly shake hands after their meeting in warsaw , poland .
at a press conference during fischer 's one-day trip to warsaw on friday , the two ministers said that they were going to kiev to let the ukrainians know they would n't be left alone and that they intended to help ukraine in building democracy . " we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .
" we are very interested in progress in the country 's democratic and economic development , " said fischer . poland has also been an advocate of quickly opening eu membership talks with ukraine .

joschka fischer stands accused of turning a blind eye to massive visa abuse between 2000 and 2002 , particularly at the german embassy in kiev , which resulted in an unusually high flood of foreign nationals , many of them ukrainians , entering germany .
in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

she had been given emergency treatment in a us military hospital in baghdad . " they -lrb- the kidnappers -rrb- never treated me badly but i wish things had gone better last night , " the exhausted journalist told colleagues of left-wing daily il manifesto who greeted her inside the plane .
she was the paper 's correspondent in iraq when she was kidnapped in baghdad a month ago . the 56-year-old veteran middle east reporter was greeted at rome 's ciampino airport by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who boarded the plane as it came to a halt . the body of italian secret service agent nicola calipari , 51 , who was killed throwing his body in front of sgrena to protect her from gunfire as their car neared a us checkpoint at baghdad airport , was due to return later saturday .
a military plane repatriating his body left the iraqi capital as sgrena was arriving in rome .
berlusconi was expected to pay his respects to the arriving agent . sgrena was hit in the shoulder and lung when us troops opened fire on the convoy taking her to baghdad airport , killing calipari .
the us military said the convoy had ignored signals to stop , and that us soldiers had waved their hands and arms , flashed white lights and fired warning shots in a failed attempt to get the vehicle to stop . sgrena was put under sedatives " because she is in a lot of pain , " said her brother who was at the airport to greet her .
" giuliana will undergo surgery for her fractured left collarbone , " said il manifesto chief editor gabriele polo .
" the bullet which possibly killed nicola calipari was removed -lrb- from her shoulder -rrb- last night , " he added . bush apologizes to berlusconi amid anger in italy at the violent end to sgrena 's month-long ordeal , us president george w. bush has promised a full investigation into the incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi us president george w. bush called italian prime minister silvio berlusconi from the us presidential jet air force one late friday " to express his regret about the incident that occurred earlier today , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said in washington . " the president assured prime minister berlusconi that the incident will be fully investigated , " mcclellan said , adding that the two spoke for about five minutes .
sgrena " was fired upon by coalition forces .
apparently there was the loss of one life , an italian citizen , and she was also injured in the incident , " mcclellan said .
" we regret the loss of life , the italian citizen who lost his life , and obviously she is in our thoughts and prayers as well . " berlusconi , a staunch ally of bush , told a press conference in rome late friday there were " disquieting questions " that needed to be answered about the incident .

this was a joyful moment which made all our fellow citizens happy , which has been transformed into profound pain by the death of a person who behaved so bravely . " anger in rome " like all italians we now expect the united states to explain this painful and tragic incident , " said italian president carlo azeglio ciampi . foreign minister gianfranco fini said he hoped calipari 's death would not trigger anti-american sentiment in italy .
" this was a macabre joke of destiny ; a tragedy decided by fate , " he told daily corriere della sera . sgrena was kidnapped in baghdad february 4 by an iraqi group who called on rome to withdraw its troops from iraq . details of the release were not known saturday . she had been shown pleading for her life in a video released by her kidnappers two weeks after her kidnapping in baghdad .
sobbing and looking thinner , she delivered an impassioned message begging rome to withdraw its troops from iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in milan attend a rally to ask the release of italian journalist of leftist newspaper " il manifesto " giuliana sgrena on feb .

a few days after the video was shown , an estimated half a million people marched in rome to demand her release . sgrena 's newspaper , the rome-based communist daily il manifesto , is a bitter opponent of the us-led invasion of iraq .
the journalist also contributes to german weekly die zeit . meanwhile in france , journalists at the left-wing daily liberation were hopeful that sgrena 's release could spell good news for its own correspondent , florence aubenas , abducted two months ago in baghdad . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french reporters freed in iraq two french journalists held hostage in iraq for the past four months were freed tuesday , officials said , sparking jubilation among relatives who called it " the most beautiful christmas present ever .

at a press conference during fischer 's one-day trip to warsaw on friday , the two ministers said that they were going to kiev to let the ukrainians know they would n't be left alone and that they intended to help ukraine in building democracy . " we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .

joschka fischer stands accused of turning a blind eye to massive visa abuse between 2000 and 2002 , particularly at the german embassy in kiev , which resulted in an unusually high flood of foreign nationals , many of them ukrainians , entering germany .
in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states says the country is " cynically " manipulating a loophole in the npt , and has threatened to take the matter to the security council to seek international sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian clergyman chants slogans during a protest to denounce iran 's pledge to open its nuclear program to unfettered inspections and suspend uranium enrichment .
if washington brings the issue before the security council , " iran will retract all the decisions it has made and the confidence-building measures it has taken , " rowhani said .
he added that iran 's leaders " could be called upon to make new decisions " , but did not provide any details on what that would involve .
" the stability in the region would become fragile and the united states would be the first to suffer , " he said . eu tries carrot and stick approach the eu is seeking a permanent halt to uranium enrichment , a process which can provide both nuclear fuel for civilian power plants and be used in the making of nuclear bombs .
in return for a permanent halt , the eu is offering iran a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart adam rotfeld will make a joint trip to the ukrainian capital of kiev on march 21 to send a signal of support to ukraine just months after the country ushered in democracy following popular protests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa lipowicz , left , co-chairwoman of the polish-german team for regional cooperation , german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , and polish foreign minister adam rotfeld , right , jointly shake hands after their meeting in warsaw , poland .

" we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .

in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .
for a few years , muslims in some states have been trying to mount initiatives of their own but without great success . in bavaria , islamic instruction classes were set up in the 1980s but were only available in the turkish language .
similar efforts were made in schleswig-holstein and the city-states of hamburg and berlin . a promising experiment since august 2003 , muslim associations in lower saxony have come together under a shura -lrb- council -rrb- to work out how to interact with the authorities and structure courses in islam . " the experiment has been promising , " said bernd knopf , a spokesman at the federal office for integration .
but an estimated 4,500 religious instructors will probably be needed . " the problem is that we ca n't massively bring thousands of teachers into the country from one day to the next , " said knopf . some teachers are being trained in turkey under an accord between universities from both countries , but in germany itself the first-ever faculty aimed at completing such a task was only opened last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 berlin , scandinavian art capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic artists : part of berlin 's vibrant art scene the roughly 6,200 danes , finns , icelanders , norwegians and swedes who 've made berlin their home may not stand out in the three-million-strong city .
but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .

it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago .

" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .

" what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin .

that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .
oh , yes .
the quiz .
in 1998 , mclaren-mercedes with mika hakkinen and david coulthard beat ferrari with michael schumacher and eddie irvine . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who can break schumacher 's grip on f1 ?
the 2005 formula one season looms large with winter training already underway .
last season was another record breaking campaign for a certain german driver and the question remains , can anyone beat michael schumacher ?
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- schumacher 's surprise injuries land him in pit stop doctors have ordered german racing star ralf schumacher off the racetrack for 12 weeks after discovering broken vertebrae following his spectacular crash 10 days ago in indianapolis .

but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .

for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .

the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .

that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .
oh , yes .
the quiz .
in 1998 , mclaren-mercedes with mika hakkinen and david coulthard beat ferrari with michael schumacher and eddie irvine . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who can break schumacher 's grip on f1 ?
the 2005 formula one season looms large with winter training already underway .
last season was another record breaking campaign for a certain german driver and the question remains , can anyone beat michael schumacher ?
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- schumacher 's surprise injuries land him in pit stop doctors have ordered german racing star ralf schumacher off the racetrack for 12 weeks after discovering broken vertebrae following his spectacular crash 10 days ago in indianapolis .

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .
it is a matter of hit and miss sometimes , but both esa and nasa said that the discovery of xmmu j.2235.3-2557 " might just be the tip of the iceberg .

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .
it is a matter of hit and miss sometimes , but both esa and nasa said that the discovery of xmmu j.2235.3-2557 " might just be the tip of the iceberg .

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .
for a few years , muslims in some states have been trying to mount initiatives of their own but without great success . in bavaria , islamic instruction classes were set up in the 1980s but were only available in the turkish language .
similar efforts were made in schleswig-holstein and the city-states of hamburg and berlin . a promising experiment since august 2003 , muslim associations in lower saxony have come together under a shura -lrb- council -rrb- to work out how to interact with the authorities and structure courses in islam . " the experiment has been promising , " said bernd knopf , a spokesman at the federal office for integration .
but an estimated 4,500 religious instructors will probably be needed . " the problem is that we ca n't massively bring thousands of teachers into the country from one day to the next , " said knopf . some teachers are being trained in turkey under an accord between universities from both countries , but in germany itself the first-ever faculty aimed at completing such a task was only opened last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart adam rotfeld will make a joint trip to the ukrainian capital of kiev on march 21 to send a signal of support to ukraine just months after the country ushered in democracy following popular protests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa lipowicz , left , co-chairwoman of the polish-german team for regional cooperation , german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , and polish foreign minister adam rotfeld , right , jointly shake hands after their meeting in warsaw , poland .
at a press conference during fischer 's one-day trip to warsaw on friday , the two ministers said that they were going to kiev to let the ukrainians know they would n't be left alone and that they intended to help ukraine in building democracy . " we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .
" we are very interested in progress in the country 's democratic and economic development , " said fischer . poland has also been an advocate of quickly opening eu membership talks with ukraine .

" it 's essential to train specialists in local government who are essential to the proper functioning of civil society , " said rotfeld . the two countries also plan to increase the number of stipends available in their countries for ukrainian students , and creating a " european university " on the polish-ukrainian border . visa scandal casts shadow on ties but , despite germany 's backing of democracy in ukraine , relations between berlin and kiev have suffered recently following revelations of a massive illegal immigrant scandal in the german foreign ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait in front of the german embassy in kiev for a visa .
joschka fischer stands accused of turning a blind eye to massive visa abuse between 2000 and 2002 , particularly at the german embassy in kiev , which resulted in an unusually high flood of foreign nationals , many of them ukrainians , entering germany .
in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states says the country is " cynically " manipulating a loophole in the npt , and has threatened to take the matter to the security council to seek international sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian clergyman chants slogans during a protest to denounce iran 's pledge to open its nuclear program to unfettered inspections and suspend uranium enrichment .
if washington brings the issue before the security council , " iran will retract all the decisions it has made and the confidence-building measures it has taken , " rowhani said .
he added that iran 's leaders " could be called upon to make new decisions " , but did not provide any details on what that would involve .
" the stability in the region would become fragile and the united states would be the first to suffer , " he said . eu tries carrot and stick approach the eu is seeking a permanent halt to uranium enrichment , a process which can provide both nuclear fuel for civilian power plants and be used in the making of nuclear bombs .
in return for a permanent halt , the eu is offering iran a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels .
but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .
" the goal is research , it 's a peaceful goal , " he said , adding : " we are not seeking to produce plutonium for military use . "
he said the construction would be completed by 2008 . the iaea last year asked iran to refrain from building the reactor amid concerns about the proliferation risk , as the reactor could produce 8-10 kilograms of plutonium per year , enough to make at least one nuclear bomb annually . iran has rejected an offer from the european union to help it get a light-water research reactor in exchange for giving up its heavy-water project . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .
" we are very interested in progress in the country 's democratic and economic development , " said fischer . poland has also been an advocate of quickly opening eu membership talks with ukraine .

in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

" we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states says the country is " cynically " manipulating a loophole in the npt , and has threatened to take the matter to the security council to seek international sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian clergyman chants slogans during a protest to denounce iran 's pledge to open its nuclear program to unfettered inspections and suspend uranium enrichment .
if washington brings the issue before the security council , " iran will retract all the decisions it has made and the confidence-building measures it has taken , " rowhani said .
he added that iran 's leaders " could be called upon to make new decisions " , but did not provide any details on what that would involve .
" the stability in the region would become fragile and the united states would be the first to suffer , " he said . eu tries carrot and stick approach the eu is seeking a permanent halt to uranium enrichment , a process which can provide both nuclear fuel for civilian power plants and be used in the making of nuclear bombs .
in return for a permanent halt , the eu is offering iran a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels .
but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states says the country is " cynically " manipulating a loophole in the npt , and has threatened to take the matter to the security council to seek international sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian clergyman chants slogans during a protest to denounce iran 's pledge to open its nuclear program to unfettered inspections and suspend uranium enrichment .
if washington brings the issue before the security council , " iran will retract all the decisions it has made and the confidence-building measures it has taken , " rowhani said .
he added that iran 's leaders " could be called upon to make new decisions " , but did not provide any details on what that would involve .
" the stability in the region would become fragile and the united states would be the first to suffer , " he said . eu tries carrot and stick approach the eu is seeking a permanent halt to uranium enrichment , a process which can provide both nuclear fuel for civilian power plants and be used in the making of nuclear bombs .
in return for a permanent halt , the eu is offering iran a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels .
but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .
" the goal is research , it 's a peaceful goal , " he said , adding : " we are not seeking to produce plutonium for military use . "
he said the construction would be completed by 2008 . the iaea last year asked iran to refrain from building the reactor amid concerns about the proliferation risk , as the reactor could produce 8-10 kilograms of plutonium per year , enough to make at least one nuclear bomb annually . iran has rejected an offer from the european union to help it get a light-water research reactor in exchange for giving up its heavy-water project . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart adam rotfeld will make a joint trip to the ukrainian capital of kiev on march 21 to send a signal of support to ukraine just months after the country ushered in democracy following popular protests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa lipowicz , left , co-chairwoman of the polish-german team for regional cooperation , german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , and polish foreign minister adam rotfeld , right , jointly shake hands after their meeting in warsaw , poland .
at a press conference during fischer 's one-day trip to warsaw on friday , the two ministers said that they were going to kiev to let the ukrainians know they would n't be left alone and that they intended to help ukraine in building democracy . " we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .
" we are very interested in progress in the country 's democratic and economic development , " said fischer . poland has also been an advocate of quickly opening eu membership talks with ukraine .
the eu has intensified cooperation with kiev , but has not offered to open accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rally in support of viktor yushchenko as part of efforts to strengthen the democratic process in ukraine , fischer and rotfeld proposed a series of measures including providing training for officials in the ukrainian government .
" it 's essential to train specialists in local government who are essential to the proper functioning of civil society , " said rotfeld . the two countries also plan to increase the number of stipends available in their countries for ukrainian students , and creating a " european university " on the polish-ukrainian border . visa scandal casts shadow on ties but , despite germany 's backing of democracy in ukraine , relations between berlin and kiev have suffered recently following revelations of a massive illegal immigrant scandal in the german foreign ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait in front of the german embassy in kiev for a visa .
joschka fischer stands accused of turning a blind eye to massive visa abuse between 2000 and 2002 , particularly at the german embassy in kiev , which resulted in an unusually high flood of foreign nationals , many of them ukrainians , entering germany .
in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .
for a few years , muslims in some states have been trying to mount initiatives of their own but without great success . in bavaria , islamic instruction classes were set up in the 1980s but were only available in the turkish language .
similar efforts were made in schleswig-holstein and the city-states of hamburg and berlin . a promising experiment since august 2003 , muslim associations in lower saxony have come together under a shura -lrb- council -rrb- to work out how to interact with the authorities and structure courses in islam . " the experiment has been promising , " said bernd knopf , a spokesman at the federal office for integration .
but an estimated 4,500 religious instructors will probably be needed . " the problem is that we ca n't massively bring thousands of teachers into the country from one day to the next , " said knopf . some teachers are being trained in turkey under an accord between universities from both countries , but in germany itself the first-ever faculty aimed at completing such a task was only opened last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 berlin , scandinavian art capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic artists : part of berlin 's vibrant art scene the roughly 6,200 danes , finns , icelanders , norwegians and swedes who 've made berlin their home may not stand out in the three-million-strong city .
but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .
from feb .

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 berlin , scandinavian art capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic artists : part of berlin 's vibrant art scene the roughly 6,200 danes , finns , icelanders , norwegians and swedes who 've made berlin their home may not stand out in the three-million-strong city .
but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .
from feb .
24 - march 21 , a series of over 100 events , including films , performances , exhibitions and concerts is showing visitors what the nordic neighbors have been doing since they made berlin their home away from home . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig , the art world 's new mecca all of a sudden , a group of artists that passed through leipzig 's academy of visual arts is the toast of the collecting world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 who 's afraid of michael schumacher ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ill will , but fans might like to see schumacher be toppled the race for the formula 1 crown starts on sunday with the australian grand prix , and michael schumacher is expecting a difficult start .
that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .
oh , yes .

that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .
it is a matter of hit and miss sometimes , but both esa and nasa said that the discovery of xmmu j.2235.3-2557 " might just be the tip of the iceberg .

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states says the country is " cynically " manipulating a loophole in the npt , and has threatened to take the matter to the security council to seek international sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian clergyman chants slogans during a protest to denounce iran 's pledge to open its nuclear program to unfettered inspections and suspend uranium enrichment .
if washington brings the issue before the security council , " iran will retract all the decisions it has made and the confidence-building measures it has taken , " rowhani said .
he added that iran 's leaders " could be called upon to make new decisions " , but did not provide any details on what that would involve .
" the stability in the region would become fragile and the united states would be the first to suffer , " he said . eu tries carrot and stick approach the eu is seeking a permanent halt to uranium enrichment , a process which can provide both nuclear fuel for civilian power plants and be used in the making of nuclear bombs .
in return for a permanent halt , the eu is offering iran a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels .
but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .
" the goal is research , it 's a peaceful goal , " he said , adding : " we are not seeking to produce plutonium for military use . "
he said the construction would be completed by 2008 . the iaea last year asked iran to refrain from building the reactor amid concerns about the proliferation risk , as the reactor could produce 8-10 kilograms of plutonium per year , enough to make at least one nuclear bomb annually . iran has rejected an offer from the european union to help it get a light-water research reactor in exchange for giving up its heavy-water project . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

she had been given emergency treatment in a us military hospital in baghdad . " they -lrb- the kidnappers -rrb- never treated me badly but i wish things had gone better last night , " the exhausted journalist told colleagues of left-wing daily il manifesto who greeted her inside the plane .
she was the paper 's correspondent in iraq when she was kidnapped in baghdad a month ago . the 56-year-old veteran middle east reporter was greeted at rome 's ciampino airport by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who boarded the plane as it came to a halt . the body of italian secret service agent nicola calipari , 51 , who was killed throwing his body in front of sgrena to protect her from gunfire as their car neared a us checkpoint at baghdad airport , was due to return later saturday .
a military plane repatriating his body left the iraqi capital as sgrena was arriving in rome .
berlusconi was expected to pay his respects to the arriving agent . sgrena was hit in the shoulder and lung when us troops opened fire on the convoy taking her to baghdad airport , killing calipari .
the us military said the convoy had ignored signals to stop , and that us soldiers had waved their hands and arms , flashed white lights and fired warning shots in a failed attempt to get the vehicle to stop . sgrena was put under sedatives " because she is in a lot of pain , " said her brother who was at the airport to greet her .
" giuliana will undergo surgery for her fractured left collarbone , " said il manifesto chief editor gabriele polo .
" the bullet which possibly killed nicola calipari was removed -lrb- from her shoulder -rrb- last night , " he added . bush apologizes to berlusconi amid anger in italy at the violent end to sgrena 's month-long ordeal , us president george w. bush has promised a full investigation into the incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi us president george w. bush called italian prime minister silvio berlusconi from the us presidential jet air force one late friday " to express his regret about the incident that occurred earlier today , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said in washington . " the president assured prime minister berlusconi that the incident will be fully investigated , " mcclellan said , adding that the two spoke for about five minutes .
sgrena " was fired upon by coalition forces .
apparently there was the loss of one life , an italian citizen , and she was also injured in the incident , " mcclellan said .
" we regret the loss of life , the italian citizen who lost his life , and obviously she is in our thoughts and prayers as well . " berlusconi , a staunch ally of bush , told a press conference in rome late friday there were " disquieting questions " that needed to be answered about the incident .
" several shots hit the car .
one man was mortally wounded by a bullet .
we are petrified and dumbfounded by this fatality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giuliana sgrena berlusconi said an agent had thrown his body in front of sgrena -lrb- photo -rrb- to protect her from the shots but was fatally wounded .
" it is a pity .
this was a joyful moment which made all our fellow citizens happy , which has been transformed into profound pain by the death of a person who behaved so bravely . " anger in rome " like all italians we now expect the united states to explain this painful and tragic incident , " said italian president carlo azeglio ciampi . foreign minister gianfranco fini said he hoped calipari 's death would not trigger anti-american sentiment in italy .
" this was a macabre joke of destiny ; a tragedy decided by fate , " he told daily corriere della sera . sgrena was kidnapped in baghdad february 4 by an iraqi group who called on rome to withdraw its troops from iraq . details of the release were not known saturday . she had been shown pleading for her life in a video released by her kidnappers two weeks after her kidnapping in baghdad .
sobbing and looking thinner , she delivered an impassioned message begging rome to withdraw its troops from iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in milan attend a rally to ask the release of italian journalist of leftist newspaper " il manifesto " giuliana sgrena on feb .

berlusconi 's centre-right government rejected the plea , and on the same day used its majority to ensure the italian senate voted to extend the mission of rome 's 3,000 troops in iraq .
a few days after the video was shown , an estimated half a million people marched in rome to demand her release . sgrena 's newspaper , the rome-based communist daily il manifesto , is a bitter opponent of the us-led invasion of iraq .
the journalist also contributes to german weekly die zeit . meanwhile in france , journalists at the left-wing daily liberation were hopeful that sgrena 's release could spell good news for its own correspondent , florence aubenas , abducted two months ago in baghdad . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french reporters freed in iraq two french journalists held hostage in iraq for the past four months were freed tuesday , officials said , sparking jubilation among relatives who called it " the most beautiful christmas present ever .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart adam rotfeld will make a joint trip to the ukrainian capital of kiev on march 21 to send a signal of support to ukraine just months after the country ushered in democracy following popular protests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa lipowicz , left , co-chairwoman of the polish-german team for regional cooperation , german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , and polish foreign minister adam rotfeld , right , jointly shake hands after their meeting in warsaw , poland .
at a press conference during fischer 's one-day trip to warsaw on friday , the two ministers said that they were going to kiev to let the ukrainians know they would n't be left alone and that they intended to help ukraine in building democracy . " we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .
" we are very interested in progress in the country 's democratic and economic development , " said fischer . poland has also been an advocate of quickly opening eu membership talks with ukraine .
the eu has intensified cooperation with kiev , but has not offered to open accession talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from throughout ukraine rally in support of viktor yushchenko as part of efforts to strengthen the democratic process in ukraine , fischer and rotfeld proposed a series of measures including providing training for officials in the ukrainian government .
" it 's essential to train specialists in local government who are essential to the proper functioning of civil society , " said rotfeld . the two countries also plan to increase the number of stipends available in their countries for ukrainian students , and creating a " european university " on the polish-ukrainian border . visa scandal casts shadow on ties but , despite germany 's backing of democracy in ukraine , relations between berlin and kiev have suffered recently following revelations of a massive illegal immigrant scandal in the german foreign ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait in front of the german embassy in kiev for a visa .
joschka fischer stands accused of turning a blind eye to massive visa abuse between 2000 and 2002 , particularly at the german embassy in kiev , which resulted in an unusually high flood of foreign nationals , many of them ukrainians , entering germany .
in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

she had been given emergency treatment in a us military hospital in baghdad . " they -lrb- the kidnappers -rrb- never treated me badly but i wish things had gone better last night , " the exhausted journalist told colleagues of left-wing daily il manifesto who greeted her inside the plane .
she was the paper 's correspondent in iraq when she was kidnapped in baghdad a month ago . the 56-year-old veteran middle east reporter was greeted at rome 's ciampino airport by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who boarded the plane as it came to a halt . the body of italian secret service agent nicola calipari , 51 , who was killed throwing his body in front of sgrena to protect her from gunfire as their car neared a us checkpoint at baghdad airport , was due to return later saturday .
a military plane repatriating his body left the iraqi capital as sgrena was arriving in rome .
berlusconi was expected to pay his respects to the arriving agent . sgrena was hit in the shoulder and lung when us troops opened fire on the convoy taking her to baghdad airport , killing calipari .
the us military said the convoy had ignored signals to stop , and that us soldiers had waved their hands and arms , flashed white lights and fired warning shots in a failed attempt to get the vehicle to stop . sgrena was put under sedatives " because she is in a lot of pain , " said her brother who was at the airport to greet her .
" giuliana will undergo surgery for her fractured left collarbone , " said il manifesto chief editor gabriele polo .
" the bullet which possibly killed nicola calipari was removed -lrb- from her shoulder -rrb- last night , " he added . bush apologizes to berlusconi amid anger in italy at the violent end to sgrena 's month-long ordeal , us president george w. bush has promised a full investigation into the incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi us president george w. bush called italian prime minister silvio berlusconi from the us presidential jet air force one late friday " to express his regret about the incident that occurred earlier today , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said in washington . " the president assured prime minister berlusconi that the incident will be fully investigated , " mcclellan said , adding that the two spoke for about five minutes .
sgrena " was fired upon by coalition forces .
apparently there was the loss of one life , an italian citizen , and she was also injured in the incident , " mcclellan said .
" we regret the loss of life , the italian citizen who lost his life , and obviously she is in our thoughts and prayers as well . " berlusconi , a staunch ally of bush , told a press conference in rome late friday there were " disquieting questions " that needed to be answered about the incident .
" several shots hit the car .
one man was mortally wounded by a bullet .
we are petrified and dumbfounded by this fatality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giuliana sgrena berlusconi said an agent had thrown his body in front of sgrena -lrb- photo -rrb- to protect her from the shots but was fatally wounded .
" it is a pity .
this was a joyful moment which made all our fellow citizens happy , which has been transformed into profound pain by the death of a person who behaved so bravely . " anger in rome " like all italians we now expect the united states to explain this painful and tragic incident , " said italian president carlo azeglio ciampi . foreign minister gianfranco fini said he hoped calipari 's death would not trigger anti-american sentiment in italy .
" this was a macabre joke of destiny ; a tragedy decided by fate , " he told daily corriere della sera . sgrena was kidnapped in baghdad february 4 by an iraqi group who called on rome to withdraw its troops from iraq . details of the release were not known saturday . she had been shown pleading for her life in a video released by her kidnappers two weeks after her kidnapping in baghdad .
sobbing and looking thinner , she delivered an impassioned message begging rome to withdraw its troops from iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in milan attend a rally to ask the release of italian journalist of leftist newspaper " il manifesto " giuliana sgrena on feb .

a few days after the video was shown , an estimated half a million people marched in rome to demand her release . sgrena 's newspaper , the rome-based communist daily il manifesto , is a bitter opponent of the us-led invasion of iraq .
the journalist also contributes to german weekly die zeit . meanwhile in france , journalists at the left-wing daily liberation were hopeful that sgrena 's release could spell good news for its own correspondent , florence aubenas , abducted two months ago in baghdad . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french reporters freed in iraq two french journalists held hostage in iraq for the past four months were freed tuesday , officials said , sparking jubilation among relatives who called it " the most beautiful christmas present ever .

" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart adam rotfeld will make a joint trip to the ukrainian capital of kiev on march 21 to send a signal of support to ukraine just months after the country ushered in democracy following popular protests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa lipowicz , left , co-chairwoman of the polish-german team for regional cooperation , german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , and polish foreign minister adam rotfeld , right , jointly shake hands after their meeting in warsaw , poland .

" we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .

in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .
for a few years , muslims in some states have been trying to mount initiatives of their own but without great success . in bavaria , islamic instruction classes were set up in the 1980s but were only available in the turkish language .
similar efforts were made in schleswig-holstein and the city-states of hamburg and berlin . a promising experiment since august 2003 , muslim associations in lower saxony have come together under a shura -lrb- council -rrb- to work out how to interact with the authorities and structure courses in islam . " the experiment has been promising , " said bernd knopf , a spokesman at the federal office for integration .
but an estimated 4,500 religious instructors will probably be needed . " the problem is that we ca n't massively bring thousands of teachers into the country from one day to the next , " said knopf . some teachers are being trained in turkey under an accord between universities from both countries , but in germany itself the first-ever faculty aimed at completing such a task was only opened last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 who 's afraid of michael schumacher ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ill will , but fans might like to see schumacher be toppled the race for the formula 1 crown starts on sunday with the australian grand prix , and michael schumacher is expecting a difficult start .
that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .

old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .

that should offer fans a change of pace , but can anyone dethrone the german champ ? firstly , we all know that michael schumacher has won the last five formula 1 titles .
for the past two or three seasons , the question everyone asked was if the german could be stopped , and it 's no different this year .
but a short quiz .
when was the last time that ferrari failed to win the constructor championship ?
ferrari is clearly the top team on the grand prix circuit and it 's getting to be a downright boring affair watching michael schumacher lead from start to finish .
last season he won 13 of 18 races , including 12 of the first 13 .
ferrari won 15 races in total .
it does n't get much duller than that .
on saturday however , schumacher was dealt a tough hand when rain lashed the albert park street circuit just as he was about to do his hot lap to claim a qualifying place at the front of the starting grid . instead all he could do was safely steer his ferrari around the hazardous track , trying to avoid mishap to finish almost 25 seconds down on surprise provisional pole-sitter giancarlo fisichella .
schumi however tried to put a brave face on the event . " obviously , this result will impact greatly on the race .
all the same we will try and bring home some points or even something better . " i do n't think a podium is out of the question , but it will be very difficult . " who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow .
the race is long and all we can do is try our best to remedy this situation . "
old ferrari in first few races to win in formula 1 , you have to have a new car each year .
it 's a sign of progress if nothing else .
ferrari has already unveiled their new f2005 but testing on it is not due to be completed until the spanish grand prix in may .
that means schumacher and teammate rubens barrichello -lrb- two victories last season -rrb- will drive last year 's car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old car will be used for the first few races .
but will it really make a difference - it 's a ferrari " running the old car will move us a little bit backwards compared if we had been able to run the new car , " schumacher told a press conference in melbourne .
but let 's be honest .
schumacher is the best formula 1 driver in history and he could win with a beat up old 1972 opel manta .
and at the ripe old age of 36 , he is a master tactician .
when asked if he had less chance of winning with the 2004 model , he replied with an emphatic ' yes . '
but he left the door open for a possible victory .
" i might still win , " he added .
" that 's what we are here for but our chances are less than if we had a new car because the competition has increased their game . "
should the competition have improved so much that ferrari fell far behind though , technical director ross brown hinted that the f2005 could be ready as soon as the third race in bahrain .
merry-go-round in formula 1 while the nine other teams more or less watched the ferrari red rear wings speed away almost every race , the powers that be have decided to institute some rule changes , e.g. motor changes are penalized , tires must be used in qualifying and during the race .
that should raise the excitement level a bit .
but will it suffice to prevent schumacher from winning his sixth , yes sixth , consecutive title ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya is now driving mclaren-mercedes , the team many see as being a potential threat to ferrari the most important question to ask though is : who , if not the rule changes , can beat michael schumacher ?
there has been a whirlwind of driver changes this year .
only eight of last year 's drivers are going to be with the same team this season .
that means new set-ups , new cars , new challenges .
the challengers some of the best drivers belong to those who switched constructors : juan pablo montoya moved from bmw-williams to mclaren-mercedes .
michael 's brother , ralf , is now with toyota and the expectations are not high .
last year 's surprise team , bar-honda , still have jenson button and takuma sato at the helm , but the new 007 model leaves something to be desired according to experts on the circuit .
another disadvantage - button would have preferred to be with bmw-williams but was forced to stay with bar after a contract dispute was settled against him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher -lrb- right -rrb- may be giving the thumbs-up here , but it may happen less often with his new team , toyota which leaves kimi raikonnen .
just two years ago , the finn chased michael to the last race only to lose the championship by two points .
the first half last year was a disaster for mclaren but now hopefully things are back on track .
ralf schumacher thinks mclaren has the best chances on sunday .
" raikonnen and montoya have the edge and will be the first two over the finishing line , " the toyota driver said .
it certainly might make the season more exciting if michael schumacher does n't win in melbourne because he has won the opening race four out of the last five years .
oh , yes .

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .

but when scientists from the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , germany decided to direct the orbiting satellite xmm-newton into the vast expanses of a nearby galaxy , they were surprised at what they found - a dense formation of galaxies some nine billion light years away .
the surprise is that with current estimates , the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
the discovered cluster of galaxies , catchily named xmmu j.2235.3-2557 , was formed when the universe was just a mere five billion years old .
this comes much earlier than researchers previously believed .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and nasa declared the sphere-like cluster of galaxies to be " the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe . "
" we have underestimated how quickly the early universe matured into its present-day incarnation , " said piero rosati , an astronomer at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- , based in garching .
" the universe has grown up fast . "
eso orbiter made discovery possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light from the cluster travelled over 9 billion light years before xxm-newton took in the rays until now , the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from " proto-clusters " - galactic clusters in the making - that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old .
but it was not possible to determine just how quickly these youthful galactic structures took to be mature galaxies as we know them today .
" we are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs , " said christopher mullis , an astronomer from the university of michigan who participated in the discovery .
he compared it to a kingdom popping up out of nowhere .
the discovery was made possible by trawling through the data retrieved by eso 's orbiter xmm-newton .
in the data , radiation was detected from the x-ray part of the energy spectrum which is invisible to optical telescopes .
the eso scientists then pointed the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile 's atacama desert at the discovery and found optical evidence to support the x-ray emissions .
the observations showed that the galaxies in the cluster are not chaotic and spread out randomly , but smoothly elliptical .
that indicates gravitational forces at work in the cluster .
in addition , the galaxies are filled with stars emitting light in the red part of the spectrum .
this is an unmistakable sign of stellar antiquity .
galaxy cluster xmmu j.2235.3-2557 possesses hundreds or possibly thousands of galaxies that are bound to each other through invisible tendrils of gravitational force .
by comparison , our own milky way galaxy is a relatively " low-density " region of the universe .
for astronomers at the max planck institute for astrophysics in garching , the search for further clusters continues .

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .
for a few years , muslims in some states have been trying to mount initiatives of their own but without great success . in bavaria , islamic instruction classes were set up in the 1980s but were only available in the turkish language .
similar efforts were made in schleswig-holstein and the city-states of hamburg and berlin . a promising experiment since august 2003 , muslim associations in lower saxony have come together under a shura -lrb- council -rrb- to work out how to interact with the authorities and structure courses in islam . " the experiment has been promising , " said bernd knopf , a spokesman at the federal office for integration .
but an estimated 4,500 religious instructors will probably be needed . " the problem is that we ca n't massively bring thousands of teachers into the country from one day to the next , " said knopf . some teachers are being trained in turkey under an accord between universities from both countries , but in germany itself the first-ever faculty aimed at completing such a task was only opened last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .
for a few years , muslims in some states have been trying to mount initiatives of their own but without great success . in bavaria , islamic instruction classes were set up in the 1980s but were only available in the turkish language .
similar efforts were made in schleswig-holstein and the city-states of hamburg and berlin . a promising experiment since august 2003 , muslim associations in lower saxony have come together under a shura -lrb- council -rrb- to work out how to interact with the authorities and structure courses in islam . " the experiment has been promising , " said bernd knopf , a spokesman at the federal office for integration .
but an estimated 4,500 religious instructors will probably be needed . " the problem is that we ca n't massively bring thousands of teachers into the country from one day to the next , " said knopf . some teachers are being trained in turkey under an accord between universities from both countries , but in germany itself the first-ever faculty aimed at completing such a task was only opened last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .

gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.03.2005 berlin , scandinavian art capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic artists : part of berlin 's vibrant art scene the roughly 6,200 danes , finns , icelanders , norwegians and swedes who 've made berlin their home may not stand out in the three-million-strong city .
but in one field there 's no overlooking them : art . when lise nellemann moved to berlin from copenhagen in 1992 , just three years after the fall of the wall , the city seemed to be infused with a sense that anything was possible . " i needed a challenge , " said nelleman , who describes herself as an artist-curator .
she says that her career was going well back home , but that she had become tired of showing her work at the same places over and over again . nelleman was n't alone in opting for a change of scene in berlin . hundreds of scandinavian artists have been drawn to the german capital in recent years , contributing to a lively and international arts community . so , what makes berlin so special to scandinavian artists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annika ström -lrb- sweden -rrb- , " 16 minutes , " video still , 2003 one obvious explanation is the city 's accessibility . the german capital is only 740 kilometers -lrb- 460 miles -rrb- south of copenhagen .
it 's geographically the nearest metropolis to most of scandinavia and twice the size of the largest nordic city , stockholm .
the proximity also helps artists from scandinavia keep tabs on the art scene back home . atle gerhardsen , 40 , who ran a gallery in oslo for five years , closed shop and moved his operations to the german capital several years ago . " you can keep a good eye on your home country from here , " he said .
" you could easily go back and forth .
that 's more difficult if you go to new york . " money makes a difference berlin 's close proximity is n't only practical for visits home , but it 's also an economic factor , allowing artists to quickly and cheaply go back north to raise funds .
the nordic countries have strong traditions of supporting the arts , which come in handy in bankrupt berlin , where the city budget for culture takes a million-euro licking year for year . until this year , nellemann had to rely entirely on funding from the north - as scandinavians call their region - to power sparwasser hq , a project space in berlin 's central mitte district she co-founded in 2000 . berlin 's low prices help to attract the artists , too . " you can find a small apartment , you find a small studio in the center of the city , " gerhardsen said .
" and this is not really possible in london or paris or new york . " indeed , berlin does have comparatively cheap rents . it ranked 20th in the economist intelligence unit 's spring 2004 worldwide cost of living index , while oslo was dubbed the 3rd most expensive city along with paris .
copenhagen placed 5th , london 6th , reykjavik , the icelandic capital , 8th and helsinki , finland , 11th . bildunterschrift : laura horelli -lrb- finland -rrb- , " 7th floor : strausberger platz / mannerheimintie , " 2003 , photographed in berlin and helsinki just like home ? there 's more to berlin 's appeal than just proximity and low rents .
gerhardsen stressed the comfort factor . " berlin has been the main cultural city since way back , " he said .
" it 's natural that after the wall came down and things started to happen , we -lrb- scandinavians -rrb- would start to turn away from other cities .
and germany 's very close culturally for norwegians and swedes and danes - it 's very easy to get comfortable . " and the city 's art scene is unique in other respects , too . " the advantage of berlin as opposed to elsewhere is that you do n't need to have a gallery to have an international career , " said aris fioretos , councilor for culture at the swedish embassy in berlin .
the hip factor " there 's a new kind of art scene that has evolved that is n't based on galleries but on institutions , " he said .
" you have mobile curators .
you do n't need to have a gallery to have a career .
especially since the decision to become the capital about 10 years ago , it 's become a city that 's been constantly negotiating its identity .
in terms of its social subcultures , it 's more open and easy to get access to the city . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ramberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " palast der zweifel " -lrb- palace of doubt -rrb- , a berlin installation , 2005 but fioretos was careful to point out that the appeal for nordic artists is an isolated phenomenon . " what attracts people to berlin is berlin , not germany , " he said .
" germany has no hip factor at all . " when helsinki-born laura horelli , 28 , completed her art degree in frankfurt in 2001 , she , like more than half of her graduating class , moved to berlin . " i was already working with a gallery in berlin and it made sense to go to berlin , " she said . " i always felt i really loved helsinki , but i felt that it did n't make sense -lrb- to go back there -rrb- . " horelli said she thinks berlin is more open than nordic cities . " often in scandinavia , it 's a bit closed and a bit claustrophobic , " she said .
" in berlin , you can be whatever you are and no one cares .
and the art scene is a lot more diverse than in some scandinavian countries . " the open city she was seconded by lars ramberg , 41 , a norwegian artist who moved to berlin seven years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vibeke tandberg -lrb- norway -rrb- , " old man going up and down a staircase , " 2003 " it has a very open structure so you do n't have to feel very alienated in berlin , although you 're not german , " he said .
" people never give you the feeling that you 're a stranger and you 're not supposed to be here - unlike paris , where you hardly become a parisian because it 's so hard to penetrate the local code . " ramberg summed up what many other nordic artists said of berlin . " it 's a community for art and that 's more significant than the prices , " he said .
" berlin , the way we know it now , is a very new city ; it 's 15 years old .
you can easily be a kind of settler without feeling you 've come to a place that 's already settled or sorted . " and , as evidence of the productive influence the german capital has had on its scandinavian art community , the " nord kultur " festival currently showcases nordic artists ' activities in the city .
from feb .
24 - march 21 , a series of over 100 events , including films , performances , exhibitions and concerts is showing visitors what the nordic neighbors have been doing since they made berlin their home away from home . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig , the art world 's new mecca all of a sudden , a group of artists that passed through leipzig 's academy of visual arts is the toast of the collecting world .

" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

" we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .

he said the construction would be completed by 2008 . the iaea last year asked iran to refrain from building the reactor amid concerns about the proliferation risk , as the reactor could produce 8-10 kilograms of plutonium per year , enough to make at least one nuclear bomb annually . iran has rejected an offer from the european union to help it get a light-water research reactor in exchange for giving up its heavy-water project . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .

taking the matter to the security council would be " playing with fire " , hassan rowhani -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country is the second largest oil producer in opec , told reporters .
" the first to suffer will be europe and the united states themselves , this would cause problems for the regional energy market , for the european economy and even more so for the united states , " rowhani said at a conference in tehran on nuclear technology and sustainable development . eu members britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to dismantle nuclear fuel work - which the united states says is part of a covert atomic weapons development - in return for economic and political rewards . tehran has argued that it wants to enrich uranium to generate atomic energy for purely civilian use , and argues such work is authorized by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states says the country is " cynically " manipulating a loophole in the npt , and has threatened to take the matter to the security council to seek international sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian clergyman chants slogans during a protest to denounce iran 's pledge to open its nuclear program to unfettered inspections and suspend uranium enrichment .
if washington brings the issue before the security council , " iran will retract all the decisions it has made and the confidence-building measures it has taken , " rowhani said .
he added that iran 's leaders " could be called upon to make new decisions " , but did not provide any details on what that would involve .
" the stability in the region would become fragile and the united states would be the first to suffer , " he said . eu tries carrot and stick approach the eu is seeking a permanent halt to uranium enrichment , a process which can provide both nuclear fuel for civilian power plants and be used in the making of nuclear bombs .
in return for a permanent halt , the eu is offering iran a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels .
but while iran agreed in november to suspend enrichment , it would not agree to a permanent halt , rowhani , who visited the german and french capitals for talks on the issue at the end of february , said saturday . " we can not have and we will not have negotiations with the europeans if what they want is an end " to uranium enrichment . " we will not continue the talks for one single minute , we have made it very clear to paris and berlin , " he said . during those visits , rowhani told officials that iran had five " other formulas to ease concerns " while still allowing tehran to continue uranium enrichment .
" i hope we will reach an agreement on these formulas because time is short , " he said . " if us pressure does n't prevent it , i think we will manage to reach an agreement with the europeans because they do n't want to deprive the iranian people of their right and will try to act fairly , " rowhani said . the european countries hope the us would lend its support to any deal by lifting its veto on iran 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership among other things . rowhani dismissed however such incentives as being of " little significance " . iran : work on reactor will go on meanwhile , rowhani insisted that the controversial construction of a heavy water reactor in iran was only for research purposes and would not be used to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear energy reactor busher in the south of the country .
" the goal is research , it 's a peaceful goal , " he said , adding : " we are not seeking to produce plutonium for military use . "
he said the construction would be completed by 2008 . the iaea last year asked iran to refrain from building the reactor amid concerns about the proliferation risk , as the reactor could produce 8-10 kilograms of plutonium per year , enough to make at least one nuclear bomb annually . iran has rejected an offer from the european union to help it get a light-water research reactor in exchange for giving up its heavy-water project . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart adam rotfeld will make a joint trip to the ukrainian capital of kiev on march 21 to send a signal of support to ukraine just months after the country ushered in democracy following popular protests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa lipowicz , left , co-chairwoman of the polish-german team for regional cooperation , german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , and polish foreign minister adam rotfeld , right , jointly shake hands after their meeting in warsaw , poland .

" we are afraid that too high expectations could cause disappointments .
it is important that we should let ukraine know that it wo n't be left to its own devices , " rotfeld said .
poland and germany would continue to " consider the best means to support the changes begun by the orange revolution , " rotfeld added . ukraine 's neighbor poland played a key role mediating in the presidential crisis in the former soviet constituent republic late last year that ended with yushchenko confirmed as head of state at the head of his " orange revolution " , a popular democratizing movement . training and student exchange german foreign minister fischer thanked poland for its commitment in resolving the ukrainian political crisis .
" we are very interested in progress in the country 's democratic and economic development , " said fischer . poland has also been an advocate of quickly opening eu membership talks with ukraine .

joschka fischer stands accused of turning a blind eye to massive visa abuse between 2000 and 2002 , particularly at the german embassy in kiev , which resulted in an unusually high flood of foreign nationals , many of them ukrainians , entering germany .
in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes who benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and put pressure on fischer for his role in the affair . on friday , recently elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who is scheduled to visit germany next week and give a speech in parliament , admitted that ties between kiev and berlin would be affected adversely by the visa scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushenko " naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland .
he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . at the same time yushchenko said he hoped that both the eu and germany would refrain from implementing a restrictive visa policy towards his country .
" we 'd be happy if the eu as well as germany could find a human form of visa policies towards ukraine , " he said , adding he intended to take up the matter with german chancellor gerhard schröder during his visit next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

" it is vital to resolve this problem and ensure that islam can be taught in german in schools , " said nadeem elyas , president of one such group , the central council of muslims , after a meeting of muslim groups in hamburg , northern germany last weekend . " if we do n't , the next generation of muslims will grow up without values , and if they do n't get their religious education in schools they risk being influenced by bad interpretations of the quran , " he added . a need for integration chancellor gerhard schröder has been increasingly keen to improve the integration of germany 's muslims , particularly with overwhelmingly muslim turkey preparing to start talks to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist demonstrators in düsseldorf legal moves have also been launched to crack down on fundamentalists in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , in which germany was an unwitting rear-base for some of the suicide hijackers . only last month , two egyptian imams were banned from the country under new legislation aimed at so-called " hate preachers " suspected of trying to spread extremist ideologies . constitutional guarantees religious courses for the estimated 600,000 muslim children living in germany are guaranteed under its constitution , the basic law .
but the law provides only for the beliefs of " religious communities " to be taught in public schools and given the division of the muslim community here , the quran has not been accepted in the classroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to a mosque in gelsenkirchen during an open day last year muslim groups in germany define themselves by the number of mosques under their jurisdiction , rather than by the number of people who are signed up as members , whereas the law only takes membership into account . berlin hesitates with education in germany controlled by the 16 states , the federal government has sought to avoid the issue .
in the most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , the authorities have for the last decade refused to allow islam into the classroom because , they say , the main muslim groups do not represent the entire community . " we plan to create a unified and democratic structure at the federal and state level , " said elyas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman wears a head scarf in germany 's national colors of black , red and gold he said six groups , accounting for around 70 percent of germany 's muslims , would join forces to have their religion taught in public schools . " within a year , we will announce the project at every mosque and organization , " elyas said . some snub the idea however the biggest group in germany , the turco-islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- , representing an estimated 150,000 muslims , appears to be snubbing the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men sit in the tea room at a ditib mosque in berlin the need for momentum is great .
for a few years , muslims in some states have been trying to mount initiatives of their own but without great success . in bavaria , islamic instruction classes were set up in the 1980s but were only available in the turkish language .
similar efforts were made in schleswig-holstein and the city-states of hamburg and berlin . a promising experiment since august 2003 , muslim associations in lower saxony have come together under a shura -lrb- council -rrb- to work out how to interact with the authorities and structure courses in islam . " the experiment has been promising , " said bernd knopf , a spokesman at the federal office for integration .
but an estimated 4,500 religious instructors will probably be needed . " the problem is that we ca n't massively bring thousands of teachers into the country from one day to the next , " said knopf . some teachers are being trained in turkey under an accord between universities from both countries , but in germany itself the first-ever faculty aimed at completing such a task was only opened last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

in between dealing with patients she can watch fishing boats coming in and out of the shetland port of lerwick and seals basking on the rocks .
a far remove from her previous practice in evesham , worcestershire , in the heart of rural england .
for years dr shore had dreamt of joining a practice on one of the scottish islands .
sabbatical and when she became entitled to her year 's sabbatical she leapt at the chance to move north with her husband and young daughter .
the move has given dr shore a chance not only to indulge her passion for walking , but also to learn some new ways of working .
the lifestyle for me is a whole lot more relaxed dr kathryn shore but she admits she nearly did not take up the opportunity .
" i photocopied the advert and kept it in my desk for weeks and almost missed the closing date .
in fact i made my first contact with the practice on the closing date .
" i have always looked at the medical journal job adverts and had thought i would like to live in either the lakes or scotland .
" adrian my husband was quite shocked when i first mentioned it and said it would not really be very practical for him because he is a vicar .
my daughter , rachel , was just seven and so it was going to be a big upheaval .
" then my husband told me just to telephone the practice and see what they said .
" they gave me such a positive response " .
so the family flew to the shetlands to inspect rachel 's new school and adrian confirmed that he would be able to get voluntary work with the nearby church .
now settled in lerwick dr shore said it is sometimes easy to forget that she is so isolated .
because the practice is situated just across the road from the general hospital she said blood tests can be back within minutes .
hospital but she said you realised how far you were from the mainland when you needed to get patients needing urgent appointments with specialists flown to the hospital in aberdeen .
despite the practice having a more diverse patient base , made up of divers and fishermen , the illnesses they suffer from are remarkably similar .
but she said that because many of her patients were temporary visitors from the ferries or fishermen they were often difficult to track down to give results to .
dr shore said that although the balance of illness in the two practices was fairly similar , there did seem to be a larger concentration of patients with chronic illnesses in lerwick as people were reluctant to live on the more remote islands while chronically ill .
" there is a remarkable amount of multiple sclerosis here , which is interesting , i do n't know whether anybody has done any studies into that .
i have n't got any figures , but it is extremely prevalent .
" in lerwick there is a large chronic disease work-load because it is the centre of shetland and as people develop chronic diseases they tend to move towards lerwick .
there is quite a concentration here of care homes . "
dr shore said that the quality of life on the islands was very high and that she would be sorry to leave in april .
she said her working day was shorter , she finishes at 4.15pm , instead of 6-7pm , but added that this might be because she is not a partner at the lerwick practice and so has less administrative responsibilities .
and that she was spending as much time as possible sightseeing .
" here i am just working four days a week so that means i can go out walking .
the lifestyle for me is a whole lot more relaxed .
" i am doing a lot of walking .
i have been to the island of foula , which is a 25 minute plane ride away and that was quite exciting because there is always the risk that if the weather changes you will not be able to come back the same day .
although fortunately we were able to get back .
" i am also going to evening classes and learning the shetland dialect .
" i will be sad to go back i would like to stay longer , i think .
but there is no work here for my husband .
" i think one thing that i will miss when i go back to evesham is being by the sea , because evesham is about as far as you can get from the sea in england . "

humans have always looked at the little beasts - so efficient , so purposeful and yet so different from us - and puzzled over what they have to tell us .
the cultural historian charlotte sleigh , author of ant -lrb- reaktion books 2003 -rrb- says that in every age we have re-interpreted the mysteries of the ant colony to suit our own ideas .
" the victorians were very impressed with the ants , and they were keen to learn from the ants and behave more like them , " she wrote .
" they particularly liked the fact that the ants worked so very hard , and also the fact that they helped one another ; they exercised what the victorians called ' mutual aid ' . "
" when our present technology-driven society considers the ant , the aim is not to find moral guidance or to admire a perfect political system , but to gather clues that will help us to solve technical problems " having told us to consider the ant , solomon points out that the ant " having no guide , overseer or ruler , provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest " .
this is the perfect model for society as seen by the 18th century philosopher adam smith -lrb- a big influence on the monetarist economics of " thatcherism " -rrb- .
the decentralised organisation of the ant-hill suits his idea that the economy needs no government intervention because the market is self-regulating .
it is also a blueprint for the ideal communist society as envisaged by marx .
the association of ants and the " communist menace " was seized on by hollywood at the height of the cold war .
sleigh particularly likes " a wonderful - no terrible - b-movie called empire of the ants in which joan collins , as an estate agent , gets it from giant ants - three perfect ingredients as far as i 'm concerned . "
the question that continues to fascinate myrmecologists -lrb- ant experts -rrb- is how ants manage to achieve such complicated results - elaborate nests , efficient food-supply , waste-disposal and so on - without having anyone in charge .
small but not so dumb when our present technology-driven society considers the ant , the aim is not to find moral guidance or to admire a perfect political system , but to gather clues that will help us to solve technical problems .
in the intelligent autonomous systems laboratory at the university of the west of england , dr chris melhuish presides over a fleet of " u-bots " .
a u-bot is a foot-high robot which glides around an arena on castors , carrying a u-shaped scoop in front of it .
it is a very stupid robot , because it carries only three instructions : if nothing is happening , keep moving .
if you hit a large obstacle , take a turn and keep moving .
if you 've got a little something in your scoop , and you hit another little something , drop what you 've got , take a turn and keep moving .
following only those instructions , dr melhuish 's robots , given enough time , can gather together a randomly distributed collection of frisbees and assemble them in a pile in the centre of their arena .
to the untrained eye they look purposeful and intelligent - just like ants .
why would anyone want to design stupid robots that can do clever things ?
dr melhuish explains : " if we want to build very small robots , there will be problems in getting computation on board , and sensing and communication .
" being small is going to be a problem .
so how can you get a whole bunch of dumb small things doing something smart ?
" and that 's why these techniques , borrowed from the ants , can be exploited to make very small robots .
it would be nice to think that we could use nano-robots to carry out repair work inside the human body , but it 's early days . "
ant-based communication systems are already in use in the fast-growing world of telephone and online digital networks .
amazingly , an ant can work out the quickest way from a to b more efficiently than a human boffin with a computer .
it bases its behaviour on pheromone trails laid down by its nest-mates .
in the fast lane so now human communications networks are often based on " virtual pheromone trails " .
myrmecologist professor nigel franks , of the university of bristol , has introduced the phrase " collective intelligence " to describe ant behaviour .
he keeps ant colonies in little plastic boxes , and he paints his ants different colours -lrb- using a brush the size of a human eyelash -rrb- so he can watch what each one does .
" army ant colonies are huge , so they have real traffic-flow problems , but it seems that evolution has programmed them with exactly the right rules of motorist behaviour so that they automatically form lanes .
" what 's really gorgeous about this is that the ants that are unburdened , that are running out to the swarm-front to find new prey-items , can run more quickly because they 're not carrying anything , and they form two express lanes on either side of the main trail , whereas all the ants coming back with food take a central lane . "
what might really worry us is the most recent discovery made in professor franks ' ant lab .
it seems that ants are not just dumb miracles of evolution - they can learn from experience .
when you destroy their nest and make them migrate to a new one , they manage it very efficiently , as you would expect .
if you repeat the exercise next day , they achieve the same thing - but this time they do it even faster .
now that 's scary .
ants are featured on bbc radio 4 in animal magic , a week-long series exploring the sometimes bizarre relationships between human beings and some of the most neglected and despised creatures on the planet .
the series starts on monday 7 march .
the programmes are broadcast at 1545 gmt each day .

the ants are on the march " go to the ant , thou sluggard , " king solomon advised in the book of proverbs chapter six , " consider her ways and be wise " .
humans have always looked at the little beasts - so efficient , so purposeful and yet so different from us - and puzzled over what they have to tell us .
the cultural historian charlotte sleigh , author of ant -lrb- reaktion books 2003 -rrb- says that in every age we have re-interpreted the mysteries of the ant colony to suit our own ideas .
" the victorians were very impressed with the ants , and they were keen to learn from the ants and behave more like them , " she wrote .
" they particularly liked the fact that the ants worked so very hard , and also the fact that they helped one another ; they exercised what the victorians called ' mutual aid ' . "
when our present technology-driven society considers the ant , the aim is not to find moral guidance or to admire a perfect political system , but to gather clues that will help us to solve technical problems having told us to consider the ant , solomon points out that the ant " having no guide , overseer or ruler , provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest " .
this is the perfect model for society as seen by the 18th century philosopher adam smith -lrb- a big influence on the monetarist economics of " thatcherism " -rrb- .
the decentralised organisation of the ant-hill suits his idea that the economy needs no government intervention because the market is self-regulating .
it is also a blueprint for the ideal communist society as envisaged by marx .
the association of ants and the " communist menace " was seized on by hollywood at the height of the cold war .
sleigh particularly likes " a wonderful - no terrible - b-movie called empire of the ants in which joan collins , as an estate agent , gets it from giant ants - three perfect ingredients as far as i 'm concerned . "
the question that continues to fascinate myrmecologists -lrb- ant experts -rrb- is how ants manage to achieve such complicated results - elaborate nests , efficient food-supply , waste-disposal and so on - without having anyone in charge .
small but not so dumb when our present technology-driven society considers the ant , the aim is not to find moral guidance or to admire a perfect political system , but to gather clues that will help us to solve technical problems .
in the intelligent autonomous systems laboratory at the university of the west of england , dr chris melhuish presides over a fleet of " u-bots " .
a u-bot is a foot-high robot which glides around an arena on castors , carrying a u-shaped scoop in front of it .
it is a very stupid robot , because it carries only three instructions : if nothing is happening , keep moving .
if you hit a large obstacle , take a turn and keep moving .
if you 've got a little something in your scoop , and you hit another little something , drop what you 've got , take a turn and keep moving .
following only those instructions , dr melhuish 's robots , given enough time , can gather together a randomly distributed collection of frisbees and assemble them in a pile in the centre of their arena .
to the untrained eye they look purposeful and intelligent - just like ants .
u-bots follow very simple rules why would anyone want to design stupid robots that can do clever things ?
dr melhuish explains : " if we want to build very small robots , there will be problems in getting computation on board , and sensing and communication .
" being small is going to be a problem .
so how can you get a whole bunch of dumb small things doing something smart ?
" and that 's why these techniques , borrowed from the ants , can be exploited to make very small robots .
it would be nice to think that we could use nano-robots to carry out repair work inside the human body , but it 's early days . "
ant-based communication systems are already in use in the fast-growing world of telephone and online digital networks .
amazingly , an ant can work out the quickest way from a to b more efficiently than a human boffin with a computer .
it bases its behaviour on pheromone trails laid down by its nest-mates .
in the fast lane so now human communications networks are often based on " virtual pheromone trails " .
myrmecologist professor nigel franks , of the university of bristol , has introduced the phrase " collective intelligence " to describe ant behaviour .
he keeps ant colonies in little plastic boxes , and he paints his ants different colours -lrb- using a brush the size of a human eyelash -rrb- so he can watch what each one does .
" army ant colonies are huge , so they have real traffic-flow problems , but it seems that evolution has programmed them with exactly the right rules of motorist behaviour so that they automatically form lanes .
" what 's really gorgeous about this is that the ants that are unburdened , that are running out to the swarm-front to find new prey-items , can run more quickly because they 're not carrying anything , and they form two express lanes on either side of the main trail , whereas all the ants coming back with food take a central lane . "
what might really worry us is the most recent discovery made in professor franks ' ant lab .
it seems that ants are not just dumb miracles of evolution - they can learn from experience .
