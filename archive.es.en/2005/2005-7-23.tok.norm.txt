following the attacks in london , some are vowing to crack down harder . for many investigators , they are the water that germinates a seed of discontent into full-grown hate for the western world . at the very latest since the sept .
11 attacks in america , european imams have been on police authorities ' watch list .
investigators are quick to crack down on those who are found to preach anti-semitism and praise terrorist attacks in their friday sermons .
several have been deported from european countries , such as italy , france and great britain , and many governments have tightened their laws regarding imams following the train bombings in madrid in 2004 and the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh last fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " jama masjid mosque " in london but now there 's talk of cracking down even harder , at least in great britain , which sports some of the continent 's most rigid anti-terror laws .
the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .
in 2004 , the government attempted to deport five imams .
a new clause to current french immigration laws allows for deportation if a foreigner is judged to have incited discrimination , hatred or violence against a person or group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy earlier this year the interior ministry set up regional intelligence offices in order to monitor support for islamic extremism .
following the london attacks on july 7 , interior minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said he is prepared to strip imams who preach violence of their french nationality . following the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh allegedly by a muslim extremist with dutch nationality last fall , the dutch government promised to come down hard on imams .
hard-line iimmigration minister rita verdonk got parliament to ban foreign imams from 2008 on .
in order to have some control over what is being taught , the government introduced state-sponsored training courses for imams .
but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2005 how corrupt is german business ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a logo associated with quality is now tarnished by corruption corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt . a sports reporter is awaiting trial while the executives of two major companies resigned as a result of suspicion of bribery .
the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .

" according to current information , german tourists were among those hurt , " schröder said in a statement , without giving a precise number . schröder condemned the attacks , which he said " showed disdain for human life " and which had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike . the horrible attacks of recent weeks demand even more intensive international cooperation , in order to dismantle terrorist networks that are even more cruel , " the german chancellor said . the al qaeda organisation in the levant and egypt said it carried out the multiple bombings in an internet statement buts its authenticity could not be verified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel after the blast at least three bomb blasts rocked the town in quick succession shortly after 1:00 am -lrb- 2200 gmt friday -rrb- .

police said at least 30 were killed at the hotel , most of them egyptian staff .
at least 83 people were killed and 200 injured . interior minister habib al-adly , in sharm el-sheikh to head up the rescue operation , said anti-terrorist units who had been rushed to the scene already had some leads which appeared to show a connection with october bombings that killed 34 people further north in the sinai peninsula . bildunterschrift : egyptian policmen patrol outside a cafe in the old market " we have indications that could lead security services to those responsible for these terrorist operations , " he told the official mena news agency .
" these elements suggest that the bombings may be linked to those that took place in taba . " bombs follow fresh london terror scare the attacks dealt a fresh blow to the tourism industry so crucial to egypt 's economy , which was still recovering from the fallout of last year 's bombings . there have also been several attacks in tourist areas in cairo in recent months , as egypt prepares for its first multi-candidate presidential election in september . panicked tourists poured out of the many night spots dotting the naama bay stretch of the resort known to egyptians as " the city of peace , " where president hosni mubarak frequently hosts world leaders and middle east summits .

what 's the point of all this .
they wo n't go to heaven .
no religion can accept such a thing , " said carol , a young briton who works as a barmaid in a pub . saturday 's attacks followed a new terror scare on london 's transport system on friday after a series of bombings on july 7 that killed at least 54 people plus four suicide bombers . at least one israeli was among the wounded in egypt but the foreign ministry said there were no immediate plans to order the evacuation of the 10,000 nationals believed to be vacationing in the sinai at the peak of the summer holiday season . receptionists at several hotels said many guests had warned they would cut their holidays short and small groups of haggard tourists could be seen dragging their luggage among the debris to board buses leaving the resort . bildunterschrift : the scene at the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh another bomb went off on a car park a few hundred metres -lrb- yards -rrb- away from the ghazala hotel , smashing shop fronts .

it was huge .
there were still lots of people at terraces and shops were still open , " said ashraf , who owns a nearby restaurant popular with russian tourists .
" i ca n't tell how many people were killed but it was carnage .
the panic was immediate and i saw a man die of a heart attack following the blasts . " the attacks came on the 53rd anniversary of the 1952 revolution that saw the overthrow of the monarchy as egyptians enjoyed an extended holiday weekend . eu voices horror at attacks un secretary general kofi annan reacted with " sorrow and anger , " , while us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who was in the region , condemned the " senseless " attacks . the european commission on saturday voiced horror at the " cowardly " suicide car bombings in egypt 's tourist-packed red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .

" i express our heartfelt sympathy and total solidarity with the victims of these cowardly acts and their families , and with president mubarak and the egyptian people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.07.2005 dealing with europe 's hate-preachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police across europe monitor friday prayers european countries have different ways of dealing with imams who preach hate .
following the attacks in london , some are vowing to crack down harder . for many investigators , they are the water that germinates a seed of discontent into full-grown hate for the western world . at the very latest since the sept .
11 attacks in america , european imams have been on police authorities ' watch list .
investigators are quick to crack down on those who are found to preach anti-semitism and praise terrorist attacks in their friday sermons .
several have been deported from european countries , such as italy , france and great britain , and many governments have tightened their laws regarding imams following the train bombings in madrid in 2004 and the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh last fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " jama masjid mosque " in london but now there 's talk of cracking down even harder , at least in great britain , which sports some of the continent 's most rigid anti-terror laws .
the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .
in 2004 , the government attempted to deport five imams .
a new clause to current french immigration laws allows for deportation if a foreigner is judged to have incited discrimination , hatred or violence against a person or group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy earlier this year the interior ministry set up regional intelligence offices in order to monitor support for islamic extremism .
following the london attacks on july 7 , interior minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said he is prepared to strip imams who preach violence of their french nationality . following the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh allegedly by a muslim extremist with dutch nationality last fall , the dutch government promised to come down hard on imams .
hard-line iimmigration minister rita verdonk got parliament to ban foreign imams from 2008 on .
in order to have some control over what is being taught , the government introduced state-sponsored training courses for imams .
but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam . " dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holland prompts soul-searching in germany as is the case in other parts of europe , the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh has prompted some serious soul-searching in germany , where politicians of every stripe are mulling integration .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .

over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .

following the attacks in london , some are vowing to crack down harder . for many investigators , they are the water that germinates a seed of discontent into full-grown hate for the western world . at the very latest since the sept .
11 attacks in america , european imams have been on police authorities ' watch list .
investigators are quick to crack down on those who are found to preach anti-semitism and praise terrorist attacks in their friday sermons .
several have been deported from european countries , such as italy , france and great britain , and many governments have tightened their laws regarding imams following the train bombings in madrid in 2004 and the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh last fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " jama masjid mosque " in london but now there 's talk of cracking down even harder , at least in great britain , which sports some of the continent 's most rigid anti-terror laws .
the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .
in 2004 , the government attempted to deport five imams .
a new clause to current french immigration laws allows for deportation if a foreigner is judged to have incited discrimination , hatred or violence against a person or group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy earlier this year the interior ministry set up regional intelligence offices in order to monitor support for islamic extremism .
following the london attacks on july 7 , interior minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said he is prepared to strip imams who preach violence of their french nationality . following the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh allegedly by a muslim extremist with dutch nationality last fall , the dutch government promised to come down hard on imams .
hard-line iimmigration minister rita verdonk got parliament to ban foreign imams from 2008 on .
in order to have some control over what is being taught , the government introduced state-sponsored training courses for imams .
but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2005 how corrupt is german business ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a logo associated with quality is now tarnished by corruption corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt . a sports reporter is awaiting trial while the executives of two major companies resigned as a result of suspicion of bribery .
the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .
but due to early elections this fall , this may have trouble getting off the ground . monika lohmüller -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .

" according to current information , german tourists were among those hurt , " schröder said in a statement , without giving a precise number . schröder condemned the attacks , which he said " showed disdain for human life " and which had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike . the horrible attacks of recent weeks demand even more intensive international cooperation , in order to dismantle terrorist networks that are even more cruel , " the german chancellor said . the al qaeda organisation in the levant and egypt said it carried out the multiple bombings in an internet statement buts its authenticity could not be verified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel after the blast at least three bomb blasts rocked the town in quick succession shortly after 1:00 am -lrb- 2200 gmt friday -rrb- .
in the most devastating of the strikes , a suicide bomber rammed his car into the ghazala garden hotel in the glitzy naama bay tourist strip . " a suicide car bomber forced the barrier at the entrance of the hotel .
a member of the security staff tried to stop him but he sped towards the reception and there was a huge explosion , " a hotel employee told afp . an afp reporter said the force of the blast sent debris flying more than 100 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from the hotel , which was threatening to collapse .
police said at least 30 were killed at the hotel , most of them egyptian staff .
at least 83 people were killed and 200 injured . interior minister habib al-adly , in sharm el-sheikh to head up the rescue operation , said anti-terrorist units who had been rushed to the scene already had some leads which appeared to show a connection with october bombings that killed 34 people further north in the sinai peninsula . bildunterschrift : egyptian policmen patrol outside a cafe in the old market " we have indications that could lead security services to those responsible for these terrorist operations , " he told the official mena news agency .
" these elements suggest that the bombings may be linked to those that took place in taba . " bombs follow fresh london terror scare the attacks dealt a fresh blow to the tourism industry so crucial to egypt 's economy , which was still recovering from the fallout of last year 's bombings . there have also been several attacks in tourist areas in cairo in recent months , as egypt prepares for its first multi-candidate presidential election in september . panicked tourists poured out of the many night spots dotting the naama bay stretch of the resort known to egyptians as " the city of peace , " where president hosni mubarak frequently hosts world leaders and middle east summits . " they -lrb- the bombers -rrb- are mad .
what 's the point of all this .
they wo n't go to heaven .
no religion can accept such a thing , " said carol , a young briton who works as a barmaid in a pub . saturday 's attacks followed a new terror scare on london 's transport system on friday after a series of bombings on july 7 that killed at least 54 people plus four suicide bombers . at least one israeli was among the wounded in egypt but the foreign ministry said there were no immediate plans to order the evacuation of the 10,000 nationals believed to be vacationing in the sinai at the peak of the summer holiday season . receptionists at several hotels said many guests had warned they would cut their holidays short and small groups of haggard tourists could be seen dragging their luggage among the debris to board buses leaving the resort . bildunterschrift : the scene at the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh another bomb went off on a car park a few hundred metres -lrb- yards -rrb- away from the ghazala hotel , smashing shop fronts .
a third bomb ripped through a busy market area , killing an undetermined number of people , some of them foreigners . " the blast took place at the edge of the souk .
it was huge .
there were still lots of people at terraces and shops were still open , " said ashraf , who owns a nearby restaurant popular with russian tourists .
" i ca n't tell how many people were killed but it was carnage .
the panic was immediate and i saw a man die of a heart attack following the blasts . " the attacks came on the 53rd anniversary of the 1952 revolution that saw the overthrow of the monarchy as egyptians enjoyed an extended holiday weekend . eu voices horror at attacks un secretary general kofi annan reacted with " sorrow and anger , " , while us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who was in the region , condemned the " senseless " attacks . the european commission on saturday voiced horror at the " cowardly " suicide car bombings in egypt 's tourist-packed red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .

" i express our heartfelt sympathy and total solidarity with the victims of these cowardly acts and their families , and with president mubarak and the egyptian people . " barroso reiterated that the commission , the european union 's executive arm , " unreservedly condemns terrorist violence , which destroys innocent lives and can not be justified in any circumstances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2005 how corrupt is german business ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a logo associated with quality is now tarnished by corruption corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt . a sports reporter is awaiting trial while the executives of two major companies resigned as a result of suspicion of bribery .
the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .
but due to early elections this fall , this may have trouble getting off the ground . monika lohmüller -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .

over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .

over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .

police ruled out a terrorist attack . the single-engined plane hit the grassy ground between the two structures and burst into flames shortly after 8:30 pm -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- , around 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from schröder 's chancellery and 300 meters from the parliament building .
no one was injured . the cause of the crash was not immediately known , but indications suggested that the pilot committed suicide .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart körting rushed to the crash site shortly after news of the incident broke , but ruled out a terrorist act . " there is no indication at this time that this could be a terrorist act , " he said , adding that the crash could be an accident or a suicide . a nosedive a police officer said the plane probably took off from an airfield in brandenburg state which surrounds berlin . witnesses said the single-engine plane flew over the parliament 's futuristic glass cupola before nosediving to the ground and going up in flames . alfred kosel , a 52-year-old tourist , described the aircraft as " a small propeller plane , similar to a world war i biplane ; it was also painted like those planes . i did n't hear the engine misfiring , nothing which would suggest engine trouble , " he said . suicide due to family problems ? the weekly focus magazine reported saturday that the crash was probably a dramatic suicide , reporting that the pilot was a refuse collector suspected of murdering his wife who has been missing for several days . the pilot was named as volker klawiter , 39 , who lived in the neighboring brandenburg district . by the time firefighters arrived at the scene the plane was already entirely destroyed by fire.police sealed off the area and the body was taken to a morgue for examination and formal identification . incident sparks security debate the incident , which led to much anxiety in the area around the parliament building in berlin on friday evening , has triggered a hot security debate in the german capital . overflights of the capital by small planes are authorized but an investigation will be carried out to determine how the aircraft could get close to sensitive buildings such as the parliament and the chancellery . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein urged a " urgent ban on overflights all year long " at " politically sensitive places " in germany .
brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm called the incident " a unbelievable security gap " and said that airspace monitoring had to be adapted to make sure that no flying object could slip through . but berlin 's körting was sceptical .
he said that " absolute security " could only be guaranteed if one slapped a ban on flying in a radius of about 100-200 kilometers around berlin , adding that such a ban would mean that all airports in berlin would have to be closed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security debate erupts in germany a debate has erupted in germany about the political consequences of the london bombings .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .

however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .

however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.07.2005 dealing with europe 's hate-preachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police across europe monitor friday prayers european countries have different ways of dealing with imams who preach hate .
following the attacks in london , some are vowing to crack down harder . for many investigators , they are the water that germinates a seed of discontent into full-grown hate for the western world . at the very latest since the sept .
11 attacks in america , european imams have been on police authorities ' watch list .
investigators are quick to crack down on those who are found to preach anti-semitism and praise terrorist attacks in their friday sermons .
several have been deported from european countries , such as italy , france and great britain , and many governments have tightened their laws regarding imams following the train bombings in madrid in 2004 and the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh last fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " jama masjid mosque " in london but now there 's talk of cracking down even harder , at least in great britain , which sports some of the continent 's most rigid anti-terror laws .
the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .
in 2004 , the government attempted to deport five imams .
a new clause to current french immigration laws allows for deportation if a foreigner is judged to have incited discrimination , hatred or violence against a person or group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy earlier this year the interior ministry set up regional intelligence offices in order to monitor support for islamic extremism .
following the london attacks on july 7 , interior minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said he is prepared to strip imams who preach violence of their french nationality . following the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh allegedly by a muslim extremist with dutch nationality last fall , the dutch government promised to come down hard on imams .
hard-line iimmigration minister rita verdonk got parliament to ban foreign imams from 2008 on .
in order to have some control over what is being taught , the government introduced state-sponsored training courses for imams .
but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam .

following the attacks in london , some are vowing to crack down harder . for many investigators , they are the water that germinates a seed of discontent into full-grown hate for the western world . at the very latest since the sept .
11 attacks in america , european imams have been on police authorities ' watch list .
investigators are quick to crack down on those who are found to preach anti-semitism and praise terrorist attacks in their friday sermons .
several have been deported from european countries , such as italy , france and great britain , and many governments have tightened their laws regarding imams following the train bombings in madrid in 2004 and the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh last fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " jama masjid mosque " in london but now there 's talk of cracking down even harder , at least in great britain , which sports some of the continent 's most rigid anti-terror laws .
the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .
in 2004 , the government attempted to deport five imams .
a new clause to current french immigration laws allows for deportation if a foreigner is judged to have incited discrimination , hatred or violence against a person or group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy earlier this year the interior ministry set up regional intelligence offices in order to monitor support for islamic extremism .
following the london attacks on july 7 , interior minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said he is prepared to strip imams who preach violence of their french nationality . following the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh allegedly by a muslim extremist with dutch nationality last fall , the dutch government promised to come down hard on imams .
hard-line iimmigration minister rita verdonk got parliament to ban foreign imams from 2008 on .
in order to have some control over what is being taught , the government introduced state-sponsored training courses for imams .
but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam . " dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holland prompts soul-searching in germany as is the case in other parts of europe , the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh has prompted some serious soul-searching in germany , where politicians of every stripe are mulling integration .

but , it 's worse if you 're a celebrity and then not have the adoring crowds to cheer you on . that 's exactly what happened to joseph or joe jackson , father of popstar icon michael jackson , who had to contend with cutting the cake minus the usual glitz at the estrel hotel in berlin 's immigrant-dominated neukölln neighborhood on friday evening .
among his brood of nine , only one , jermaine , showed up .
the others , including michael , janet and latoya , stayed away . the absence of michael seemed to have also turned off the fans - instead of the expected 1,000 , just a few hundred appeared .
many of them wore t-shirts reading " michael is innocent . " many also seemed disappointed by the evening 's events .
while the jacksons and a few dozen invited celebrities feasted on a four course menu by candlelight , the fans behind the barricades had to pay for their hotdogs themselves . even expected celebrities like mike tyson and liz taylor were nowhere to be seen .
instead , a few german singers and ex-boxers wandered around on the red carpet . birthday boy joe however thanked the german fans for their support during michael 's trying trial in california where he was acquitted of child sex abuse charges .
son jermaine added : " thank-you for all your love and prayers . " the rest of the evening was taken over by crooning look-alikes of tina turner , tom jones and others provided by the hotel 's own show . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael jackson to move to berlin not only is michael jackson expected at his father 's birthday bash in berlin this weekend , the pop star is also rumored to be starting a new life in the german capital , complete with a copy of his neverland ranch .
-lrb- july 20 , 2005 -rrb- jackson clan to boogie in berlin berliners can dust off their dancing shoes - it 's really happening .
after much speculation , the family of exonerated pop star michael jackson will hold a reunion in the german capital .

but , it 's worse if you 're a celebrity and then not have the adoring crowds to cheer you on . that 's exactly what happened to joseph or joe jackson , father of popstar icon michael jackson , who had to contend with cutting the cake minus the usual glitz at the estrel hotel in berlin 's immigrant-dominated neukölln neighborhood on friday evening .
among his brood of nine , only one , jermaine , showed up .
the others , including michael , janet and latoya , stayed away . the absence of michael seemed to have also turned off the fans - instead of the expected 1,000 , just a few hundred appeared .
many of them wore t-shirts reading " michael is innocent . " many also seemed disappointed by the evening 's events .
while the jacksons and a few dozen invited celebrities feasted on a four course menu by candlelight , the fans behind the barricades had to pay for their hotdogs themselves . even expected celebrities like mike tyson and liz taylor were nowhere to be seen .
instead , a few german singers and ex-boxers wandered around on the red carpet . birthday boy joe however thanked the german fans for their support during michael 's trying trial in california where he was acquitted of child sex abuse charges .
son jermaine added : " thank-you for all your love and prayers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2005 the winding ways of an unequal rivalry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich and armstrong : the texan always had the upper hand if everything goes as expected , lance armstrong will celebrate his seventh consecutive tour de france victory on sunday .
over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .

but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam .

but , it 's worse if you 're a celebrity and then not have the adoring crowds to cheer you on . that 's exactly what happened to joseph or joe jackson , father of popstar icon michael jackson , who had to contend with cutting the cake minus the usual glitz at the estrel hotel in berlin 's immigrant-dominated neukölln neighborhood on friday evening .
among his brood of nine , only one , jermaine , showed up .
the others , including michael , janet and latoya , stayed away . the absence of michael seemed to have also turned off the fans - instead of the expected 1,000 , just a few hundred appeared .
many of them wore t-shirts reading " michael is innocent . " many also seemed disappointed by the evening 's events .
while the jacksons and a few dozen invited celebrities feasted on a four course menu by candlelight , the fans behind the barricades had to pay for their hotdogs themselves . even expected celebrities like mike tyson and liz taylor were nowhere to be seen .
instead , a few german singers and ex-boxers wandered around on the red carpet . birthday boy joe however thanked the german fans for their support during michael 's trying trial in california where he was acquitted of child sex abuse charges .
son jermaine added : " thank-you for all your love and prayers .

police ruled out a terrorist attack . the single-engined plane hit the grassy ground between the two structures and burst into flames shortly after 8:30 pm -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- , around 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from schröder 's chancellery and 300 meters from the parliament building .
no one was injured . the cause of the crash was not immediately known , but indications suggested that the pilot committed suicide .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart körting rushed to the crash site shortly after news of the incident broke , but ruled out a terrorist act . " there is no indication at this time that this could be a terrorist act , " he said , adding that the crash could be an accident or a suicide . a nosedive a police officer said the plane probably took off from an airfield in brandenburg state which surrounds berlin . witnesses said the single-engine plane flew over the parliament 's futuristic glass cupola before nosediving to the ground and going up in flames . alfred kosel , a 52-year-old tourist , described the aircraft as " a small propeller plane , similar to a world war i biplane ; it was also painted like those planes . i did n't hear the engine misfiring , nothing which would suggest engine trouble , " he said . suicide due to family problems ? the weekly focus magazine reported saturday that the crash was probably a dramatic suicide , reporting that the pilot was a refuse collector suspected of murdering his wife who has been missing for several days . the pilot was named as volker klawiter , 39 , who lived in the neighboring brandenburg district . by the time firefighters arrived at the scene the plane was already entirely destroyed by fire.police sealed off the area and the body was taken to a morgue for examination and formal identification . incident sparks security debate the incident , which led to much anxiety in the area around the parliament building in berlin on friday evening , has triggered a hot security debate in the german capital . overflights of the capital by small planes are authorized but an investigation will be carried out to determine how the aircraft could get close to sensitive buildings such as the parliament and the chancellery . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein urged a " urgent ban on overflights all year long " at " politically sensitive places " in germany .
brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm called the incident " a unbelievable security gap " and said that airspace monitoring had to be adapted to make sure that no flying object could slip through . but berlin 's körting was sceptical .
he said that " absolute security " could only be guaranteed if one slapped a ban on flying in a radius of about 100-200 kilometers around berlin , adding that such a ban would mean that all airports in berlin would have to be closed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security debate erupts in germany a debate has erupted in germany about the political consequences of the london bombings .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .

however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .

police ruled out a terrorist attack . the single-engined plane hit the grassy ground between the two structures and burst into flames shortly after 8:30 pm -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- , around 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from schröder 's chancellery and 300 meters from the parliament building .
no one was injured . the cause of the crash was not immediately known , but indications suggested that the pilot committed suicide .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart körting rushed to the crash site shortly after news of the incident broke , but ruled out a terrorist act . " there is no indication at this time that this could be a terrorist act , " he said , adding that the crash could be an accident or a suicide . a nosedive a police officer said the plane probably took off from an airfield in brandenburg state which surrounds berlin . witnesses said the single-engine plane flew over the parliament 's futuristic glass cupola before nosediving to the ground and going up in flames . alfred kosel , a 52-year-old tourist , described the aircraft as " a small propeller plane , similar to a world war i biplane ; it was also painted like those planes . i did n't hear the engine misfiring , nothing which would suggest engine trouble , " he said . suicide due to family problems ? the weekly focus magazine reported saturday that the crash was probably a dramatic suicide , reporting that the pilot was a refuse collector suspected of murdering his wife who has been missing for several days . the pilot was named as volker klawiter , 39 , who lived in the neighboring brandenburg district . by the time firefighters arrived at the scene the plane was already entirely destroyed by fire.police sealed off the area and the body was taken to a morgue for examination and formal identification . incident sparks security debate the incident , which led to much anxiety in the area around the parliament building in berlin on friday evening , has triggered a hot security debate in the german capital . overflights of the capital by small planes are authorized but an investigation will be carried out to determine how the aircraft could get close to sensitive buildings such as the parliament and the chancellery . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein urged a " urgent ban on overflights all year long " at " politically sensitive places " in germany .
brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm called the incident " a unbelievable security gap " and said that airspace monitoring had to be adapted to make sure that no flying object could slip through . but berlin 's körting was sceptical .
he said that " absolute security " could only be guaranteed if one slapped a ban on flying in a radius of about 100-200 kilometers around berlin , adding that such a ban would mean that all airports in berlin would have to be closed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security debate erupts in germany a debate has erupted in germany about the political consequences of the london bombings .

police ruled out a terrorist attack . the single-engined plane hit the grassy ground between the two structures and burst into flames shortly after 8:30 pm -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- , around 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from schröder 's chancellery and 300 meters from the parliament building .
no one was injured . the cause of the crash was not immediately known , but indications suggested that the pilot committed suicide .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart körting rushed to the crash site shortly after news of the incident broke , but ruled out a terrorist act . " there is no indication at this time that this could be a terrorist act , " he said , adding that the crash could be an accident or a suicide . a nosedive a police officer said the plane probably took off from an airfield in brandenburg state which surrounds berlin . witnesses said the single-engine plane flew over the parliament 's futuristic glass cupola before nosediving to the ground and going up in flames . alfred kosel , a 52-year-old tourist , described the aircraft as " a small propeller plane , similar to a world war i biplane ; it was also painted like those planes . i did n't hear the engine misfiring , nothing which would suggest engine trouble , " he said . suicide due to family problems ? the weekly focus magazine reported saturday that the crash was probably a dramatic suicide , reporting that the pilot was a refuse collector suspected of murdering his wife who has been missing for several days . the pilot was named as volker klawiter , 39 , who lived in the neighboring brandenburg district . by the time firefighters arrived at the scene the plane was already entirely destroyed by fire.police sealed off the area and the body was taken to a morgue for examination and formal identification . incident sparks security debate the incident , which led to much anxiety in the area around the parliament building in berlin on friday evening , has triggered a hot security debate in the german capital . overflights of the capital by small planes are authorized but an investigation will be carried out to determine how the aircraft could get close to sensitive buildings such as the parliament and the chancellery . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein urged a " urgent ban on overflights all year long " at " politically sensitive places " in germany .
brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm called the incident " a unbelievable security gap " and said that airspace monitoring had to be adapted to make sure that no flying object could slip through . but berlin 's körting was sceptical .
he said that " absolute security " could only be guaranteed if one slapped a ban on flying in a radius of about 100-200 kilometers around berlin , adding that such a ban would mean that all airports in berlin would have to be closed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security debate erupts in germany a debate has erupted in germany about the political consequences of the london bombings .

over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .

after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .

that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .

i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .

but , it 's worse if you 're a celebrity and then not have the adoring crowds to cheer you on . that 's exactly what happened to joseph or joe jackson , father of popstar icon michael jackson , who had to contend with cutting the cake minus the usual glitz at the estrel hotel in berlin 's immigrant-dominated neukölln neighborhood on friday evening .
among his brood of nine , only one , jermaine , showed up .
the others , including michael , janet and latoya , stayed away . the absence of michael seemed to have also turned off the fans - instead of the expected 1,000 , just a few hundred appeared .
many of them wore t-shirts reading " michael is innocent . " many also seemed disappointed by the evening 's events .
while the jacksons and a few dozen invited celebrities feasted on a four course menu by candlelight , the fans behind the barricades had to pay for their hotdogs themselves . even expected celebrities like mike tyson and liz taylor were nowhere to be seen .
instead , a few german singers and ex-boxers wandered around on the red carpet . birthday boy joe however thanked the german fans for their support during michael 's trying trial in california where he was acquitted of child sex abuse charges .
son jermaine added : " thank-you for all your love and prayers .

" i can confirm a second man has been arrested , it was yesterday -lrb- friday -rrb- night , " a spokesman for london 's metropolitan police told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london the arrest took place in the same area of south london , stockwell , as a first suspect was apprehended earlier friday and a third man was shot dead by police in front of terrified onlookers . british newspapers saturday published grainy security camera stills showing four wanted men at or near the sites of thursday 's seemingly botched suicide attacks , as police urged the public to come forward with information . " find them " " find them , " screamed the huge-type headline in the tabloid daily mirror saturday . " the four most wanted , " said the independent , like every newspaper carrying pictures of the casually-dressed men in subway station tunnels or on a bus , one with a rucksack believed to have held his bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four suspected suicide bomber seen in this cctv image made available in london by the metropolitan police .
police , who were already gathering forensic evidence from the rucksacks and bombs that failed to explode , said they had received more than 400 calls following their appeal for help from the public . nerves were on edge in the british capital saturday .
mile end underground station in east london was briefly evacuated and closed after an unspecified alert , police said after they received information . on thursday , exactly a fortnight after four british muslim men killed themselves and 52 others in a co-ordinated series of blasts on three london subway trains and a bus , the new attackers attempted a repeat attack .
their detonators appeared to work but the explosive mix in their rucksacks failed to go off .
no-one was injured and the bombers fled the scenes . on friday morning , police cornered a man of ethnic asian origin inside a subway train at stockwell after a frantic chase .
screaming at onlookers to get out of the way , they pinned him down in a carriage and shot him at point-blank range . police refused to say whether the dead man had been carrying any explosives at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police shot and killed a man at a stockwell station on friday , soon after the stockwell shooting , police arrested a man under anti-terrorism laws after an armed raid on a nearby apartment block , and another was arrested around midnight .
both men were being held in a high security police station in central london in connection with the investigation into the attempted attacks on london 's transport network , police said . the first man was being held under a section of britain 's 2001 anti-terrorism law relating to the " commission , instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism " , a police spokeswoman told afp . british police in dilemma according to saturday 's edition of the sun newspaper , one of the detained men is one of the suspected bombers , whose device partially exploded thursday lunchtime on a number 26 bus in east london .

saturday 's newspapers noted the " deadly dilemma " now faced by british police in tackling suspects who might be carrying a suicide bomb . britons , who have only become accustomed to seeing their police armed in recent years , appeared to be torn between a sense of necessity and disquiet about the shooting by police .
some papers likened the police tactics to those used by israeli security forces in dealing with suicide bombers . london mayor ken livingstone said a " shoot-to-kill policy " was necessary for those suspected of carrying a bomb , and he had strong support from some quarters .
the daily express newspaper headlined : " shoot all bombers " . but the muslim council of britain demanded police explain their actions and said muslims feared reprisal attacks .
friday 's shooting at stockwell will be automatically investigated by the independent police complaints commission . the four men named by police as the july 7 suicide bombers were all muslim britons , three of pakistani origin .
the fourth was a muslim convert born in jamaica . a survey of british muslims in saturday 's daily telegraph newspaper found that only six percent thought the july 7 attacks were justified . however , when asked whether they had sympathy with the " feelings and motives " of the bombers , 13 percent said they had a lot of sympathy and a further 11 percent had a little . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london police kill suspect , arrest two others london police shot and killed a suspected suicide bomber on a northern line underground train station on friday and arrested two others in connection with thursday 's explosions .

but , it 's worse if you 're a celebrity and then not have the adoring crowds to cheer you on . that 's exactly what happened to joseph or joe jackson , father of popstar icon michael jackson , who had to contend with cutting the cake minus the usual glitz at the estrel hotel in berlin 's immigrant-dominated neukölln neighborhood on friday evening .
among his brood of nine , only one , jermaine , showed up .
the others , including michael , janet and latoya , stayed away . the absence of michael seemed to have also turned off the fans - instead of the expected 1,000 , just a few hundred appeared .
many of them wore t-shirts reading " michael is innocent . " many also seemed disappointed by the evening 's events .
while the jacksons and a few dozen invited celebrities feasted on a four course menu by candlelight , the fans behind the barricades had to pay for their hotdogs themselves . even expected celebrities like mike tyson and liz taylor were nowhere to be seen .
instead , a few german singers and ex-boxers wandered around on the red carpet . birthday boy joe however thanked the german fans for their support during michael 's trying trial in california where he was acquitted of child sex abuse charges .
son jermaine added : " thank-you for all your love and prayers .

police , who were already gathering forensic evidence from the rucksacks and bombs that failed to explode , said they had received more than 400 calls following their appeal for help from the public . nerves were on edge in the british capital saturday .
mile end underground station in east london was briefly evacuated and closed after an unspecified alert , police said after they received information . on thursday , exactly a fortnight after four british muslim men killed themselves and 52 others in a co-ordinated series of blasts on three london subway trains and a bus , the new attackers attempted a repeat attack .
their detonators appeared to work but the explosive mix in their rucksacks failed to go off .
no-one was injured and the bombers fled the scenes . on friday morning , police cornered a man of ethnic asian origin inside a subway train at stockwell after a frantic chase .
screaming at onlookers to get out of the way , they pinned him down in a carriage and shot him at point-blank range . police refused to say whether the dead man had been carrying any explosives at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police shot and killed a man at a stockwell station on friday , soon after the stockwell shooting , police arrested a man under anti-terrorism laws after an armed raid on a nearby apartment block , and another was arrested around midnight .
both men were being held in a high security police station in central london in connection with the investigation into the attempted attacks on london 's transport network , police said . the first man was being held under a section of britain 's 2001 anti-terrorism law relating to the " commission , instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism " , a police spokeswoman told afp . british police in dilemma according to saturday 's edition of the sun newspaper , one of the detained men is one of the suspected bombers , whose device partially exploded thursday lunchtime on a number 26 bus in east london .

saturday 's newspapers noted the " deadly dilemma " now faced by british police in tackling suspects who might be carrying a suicide bomb . britons , who have only become accustomed to seeing their police armed in recent years , appeared to be torn between a sense of necessity and disquiet about the shooting by police .
some papers likened the police tactics to those used by israeli security forces in dealing with suicide bombers . london mayor ken livingstone said a " shoot-to-kill policy " was necessary for those suspected of carrying a bomb , and he had strong support from some quarters .
the daily express newspaper headlined : " shoot all bombers " . but the muslim council of britain demanded police explain their actions and said muslims feared reprisal attacks .
friday 's shooting at stockwell will be automatically investigated by the independent police complaints commission . the four men named by police as the july 7 suicide bombers were all muslim britons , three of pakistani origin .
the fourth was a muslim convert born in jamaica . a survey of british muslims in saturday 's daily telegraph newspaper found that only six percent thought the july 7 attacks were justified . however , when asked whether they had sympathy with the " feelings and motives " of the bombers , 13 percent said they had a lot of sympathy and a further 11 percent had a little . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london police kill suspect , arrest two others london police shot and killed a suspected suicide bomber on a northern line underground train station on friday and arrested two others in connection with thursday 's explosions .

mile end underground station in east london was briefly evacuated and closed after an unspecified alert , police said after they received information . on thursday , exactly a fortnight after four british muslim men killed themselves and 52 others in a co-ordinated series of blasts on three london subway trains and a bus , the new attackers attempted a repeat attack .
their detonators appeared to work but the explosive mix in their rucksacks failed to go off .
no-one was injured and the bombers fled the scenes . on friday morning , police cornered a man of ethnic asian origin inside a subway train at stockwell after a frantic chase .
screaming at onlookers to get out of the way , they pinned him down in a carriage and shot him at point-blank range . police refused to say whether the dead man had been carrying any explosives at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police shot and killed a man at a stockwell station on friday , soon after the stockwell shooting , police arrested a man under anti-terrorism laws after an armed raid on a nearby apartment block , and another was arrested around midnight .
both men were being held in a high security police station in central london in connection with the investigation into the attempted attacks on london 's transport network , police said . the first man was being held under a section of britain 's 2001 anti-terrorism law relating to the " commission , instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism " , a police spokeswoman told afp . british police in dilemma according to saturday 's edition of the sun newspaper , one of the detained men is one of the suspected bombers , whose device partially exploded thursday lunchtime on a number 26 bus in east london . " one down ... three to go , " was the headline on the tabloid 's front page , above a picture of the arrested man being driven away wearing a paper suit to protect potential evidence on his clothes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters read the morning headlines onboard the underground after thursday 's bomb attacks plunged the tube networks into chaos in london .
saturday 's newspapers noted the " deadly dilemma " now faced by british police in tackling suspects who might be carrying a suicide bomb . britons , who have only become accustomed to seeing their police armed in recent years , appeared to be torn between a sense of necessity and disquiet about the shooting by police .
some papers likened the police tactics to those used by israeli security forces in dealing with suicide bombers . london mayor ken livingstone said a " shoot-to-kill policy " was necessary for those suspected of carrying a bomb , and he had strong support from some quarters .
the daily express newspaper headlined : " shoot all bombers " . but the muslim council of britain demanded police explain their actions and said muslims feared reprisal attacks .
friday 's shooting at stockwell will be automatically investigated by the independent police complaints commission . the four men named by police as the july 7 suicide bombers were all muslim britons , three of pakistani origin .
the fourth was a muslim convert born in jamaica . a survey of british muslims in saturday 's daily telegraph newspaper found that only six percent thought the july 7 attacks were justified . however , when asked whether they had sympathy with the " feelings and motives " of the bombers , 13 percent said they had a lot of sympathy and a further 11 percent had a little . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london police kill suspect , arrest two others london police shot and killed a suspected suicide bomber on a northern line underground train station on friday and arrested two others in connection with thursday 's explosions .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .

problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .

the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .

however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2005 how corrupt is german business ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a logo associated with quality is now tarnished by corruption corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt . a sports reporter is awaiting trial while the executives of two major companies resigned as a result of suspicion of bribery .
the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .
but due to early elections this fall , this may have trouble getting off the ground . monika lohmüller -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .
the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 .
-lrb- july 19 , 2005 -rrb- vw scandal puts pressure on works council the growing bribery scandal at volkswagen has led critics to challenge the system of co-determination in labor relations .
it was long considered the springboard for west germany 's postwar economic miracle .

" i can confirm a second man has been arrested , it was yesterday -lrb- friday -rrb- night , " a spokesman for london 's metropolitan police told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london the arrest took place in the same area of south london , stockwell , as a first suspect was apprehended earlier friday and a third man was shot dead by police in front of terrified onlookers . british newspapers saturday published grainy security camera stills showing four wanted men at or near the sites of thursday 's seemingly botched suicide attacks , as police urged the public to come forward with information . " find them " " find them , " screamed the huge-type headline in the tabloid daily mirror saturday . " the four most wanted , " said the independent , like every newspaper carrying pictures of the casually-dressed men in subway station tunnels or on a bus , one with a rucksack believed to have held his bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four suspected suicide bomber seen in this cctv image made available in london by the metropolitan police .
police , who were already gathering forensic evidence from the rucksacks and bombs that failed to explode , said they had received more than 400 calls following their appeal for help from the public . nerves were on edge in the british capital saturday .
mile end underground station in east london was briefly evacuated and closed after an unspecified alert , police said after they received information . on thursday , exactly a fortnight after four british muslim men killed themselves and 52 others in a co-ordinated series of blasts on three london subway trains and a bus , the new attackers attempted a repeat attack .
their detonators appeared to work but the explosive mix in their rucksacks failed to go off .
no-one was injured and the bombers fled the scenes . on friday morning , police cornered a man of ethnic asian origin inside a subway train at stockwell after a frantic chase .
screaming at onlookers to get out of the way , they pinned him down in a carriage and shot him at point-blank range . police refused to say whether the dead man had been carrying any explosives at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police shot and killed a man at a stockwell station on friday , soon after the stockwell shooting , police arrested a man under anti-terrorism laws after an armed raid on a nearby apartment block , and another was arrested around midnight .
both men were being held in a high security police station in central london in connection with the investigation into the attempted attacks on london 's transport network , police said . the first man was being held under a section of britain 's 2001 anti-terrorism law relating to the " commission , instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism " , a police spokeswoman told afp . british police in dilemma according to saturday 's edition of the sun newspaper , one of the detained men is one of the suspected bombers , whose device partially exploded thursday lunchtime on a number 26 bus in east london . " one down ... three to go , " was the headline on the tabloid 's front page , above a picture of the arrested man being driven away wearing a paper suit to protect potential evidence on his clothes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters read the morning headlines onboard the underground after thursday 's bomb attacks plunged the tube networks into chaos in london .
saturday 's newspapers noted the " deadly dilemma " now faced by british police in tackling suspects who might be carrying a suicide bomb . britons , who have only become accustomed to seeing their police armed in recent years , appeared to be torn between a sense of necessity and disquiet about the shooting by police .
some papers likened the police tactics to those used by israeli security forces in dealing with suicide bombers . london mayor ken livingstone said a " shoot-to-kill policy " was necessary for those suspected of carrying a bomb , and he had strong support from some quarters .
the daily express newspaper headlined : " shoot all bombers " . but the muslim council of britain demanded police explain their actions and said muslims feared reprisal attacks .
friday 's shooting at stockwell will be automatically investigated by the independent police complaints commission . the four men named by police as the july 7 suicide bombers were all muslim britons , three of pakistani origin .
the fourth was a muslim convert born in jamaica . a survey of british muslims in saturday 's daily telegraph newspaper found that only six percent thought the july 7 attacks were justified . however , when asked whether they had sympathy with the " feelings and motives " of the bombers , 13 percent said they had a lot of sympathy and a further 11 percent had a little . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london police kill suspect , arrest two others london police shot and killed a suspected suicide bomber on a northern line underground train station on friday and arrested two others in connection with thursday 's explosions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2005 how corrupt is german business ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a logo associated with quality is now tarnished by corruption corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt . a sports reporter is awaiting trial while the executives of two major companies resigned as a result of suspicion of bribery .
the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .
but due to early elections this fall , this may have trouble getting off the ground . monika lohmüller -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .
the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 .

police ruled out a terrorist attack . the single-engined plane hit the grassy ground between the two structures and burst into flames shortly after 8:30 pm -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- , around 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from schröder 's chancellery and 300 meters from the parliament building .
no one was injured . the cause of the crash was not immediately known , but indications suggested that the pilot committed suicide .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart körting rushed to the crash site shortly after news of the incident broke , but ruled out a terrorist act . " there is no indication at this time that this could be a terrorist act , " he said , adding that the crash could be an accident or a suicide . a nosedive a police officer said the plane probably took off from an airfield in brandenburg state which surrounds berlin . witnesses said the single-engine plane flew over the parliament 's futuristic glass cupola before nosediving to the ground and going up in flames . alfred kosel , a 52-year-old tourist , described the aircraft as " a small propeller plane , similar to a world war i biplane ; it was also painted like those planes . i did n't hear the engine misfiring , nothing which would suggest engine trouble , " he said . suicide due to family problems ? the weekly focus magazine reported saturday that the crash was probably a dramatic suicide , reporting that the pilot was a refuse collector suspected of murdering his wife who has been missing for several days . the pilot was named as volker klawiter , 39 , who lived in the neighboring brandenburg district . by the time firefighters arrived at the scene the plane was already entirely destroyed by fire.police sealed off the area and the body was taken to a morgue for examination and formal identification . incident sparks security debate the incident , which led to much anxiety in the area around the parliament building in berlin on friday evening , has triggered a hot security debate in the german capital . overflights of the capital by small planes are authorized but an investigation will be carried out to determine how the aircraft could get close to sensitive buildings such as the parliament and the chancellery . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein urged a " urgent ban on overflights all year long " at " politically sensitive places " in germany .
brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm called the incident " a unbelievable security gap " and said that airspace monitoring had to be adapted to make sure that no flying object could slip through . but berlin 's körting was sceptical .
he said that " absolute security " could only be guaranteed if one slapped a ban on flying in a radius of about 100-200 kilometers around berlin , adding that such a ban would mean that all airports in berlin would have to be closed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security debate erupts in germany a debate has erupted in germany about the political consequences of the london bombings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2005 the winding ways of an unequal rivalry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich and armstrong : the texan always had the upper hand if everything goes as expected , lance armstrong will celebrate his seventh consecutive tour de france victory on sunday .
over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .

following the attacks in london , some are vowing to crack down harder . for many investigators , they are the water that germinates a seed of discontent into full-grown hate for the western world . at the very latest since the sept .
11 attacks in america , european imams have been on police authorities ' watch list .
investigators are quick to crack down on those who are found to preach anti-semitism and praise terrorist attacks in their friday sermons .
several have been deported from european countries , such as italy , france and great britain , and many governments have tightened their laws regarding imams following the train bombings in madrid in 2004 and the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh last fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " jama masjid mosque " in london but now there 's talk of cracking down even harder , at least in great britain , which sports some of the continent 's most rigid anti-terror laws .
the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .
in 2004 , the government attempted to deport five imams .
a new clause to current french immigration laws allows for deportation if a foreigner is judged to have incited discrimination , hatred or violence against a person or group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy earlier this year the interior ministry set up regional intelligence offices in order to monitor support for islamic extremism .
following the london attacks on july 7 , interior minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said he is prepared to strip imams who preach violence of their french nationality . following the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh allegedly by a muslim extremist with dutch nationality last fall , the dutch government promised to come down hard on imams .
hard-line iimmigration minister rita verdonk got parliament to ban foreign imams from 2008 on .
in order to have some control over what is being taught , the government introduced state-sponsored training courses for imams .
but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .

" according to current information , german tourists were among those hurt , " schröder said in a statement , without giving a precise number . schröder condemned the attacks , which he said " showed disdain for human life " and which had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike . the horrible attacks of recent weeks demand even more intensive international cooperation , in order to dismantle terrorist networks that are even more cruel , " the german chancellor said . the al qaeda organisation in the levant and egypt said it carried out the multiple bombings in an internet statement buts its authenticity could not be verified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel after the blast at least three bomb blasts rocked the town in quick succession shortly after 1:00 am -lrb- 2200 gmt friday -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.07.2005 dealing with europe 's hate-preachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police across europe monitor friday prayers european countries have different ways of dealing with imams who preach hate .
following the attacks in london , some are vowing to crack down harder . for many investigators , they are the water that germinates a seed of discontent into full-grown hate for the western world . at the very latest since the sept .
11 attacks in america , european imams have been on police authorities ' watch list .
investigators are quick to crack down on those who are found to preach anti-semitism and praise terrorist attacks in their friday sermons .
several have been deported from european countries , such as italy , france and great britain , and many governments have tightened their laws regarding imams following the train bombings in madrid in 2004 and the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh last fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " jama masjid mosque " in london but now there 's talk of cracking down even harder , at least in great britain , which sports some of the continent 's most rigid anti-terror laws .
the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .
in 2004 , the government attempted to deport five imams .
a new clause to current french immigration laws allows for deportation if a foreigner is judged to have incited discrimination , hatred or violence against a person or group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy earlier this year the interior ministry set up regional intelligence offices in order to monitor support for islamic extremism .
following the london attacks on july 7 , interior minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said he is prepared to strip imams who preach violence of their french nationality . following the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh allegedly by a muslim extremist with dutch nationality last fall , the dutch government promised to come down hard on imams .
hard-line iimmigration minister rita verdonk got parliament to ban foreign imams from 2008 on .
in order to have some control over what is being taught , the government introduced state-sponsored training courses for imams .
but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam . " dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holland prompts soul-searching in germany as is the case in other parts of europe , the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh has prompted some serious soul-searching in germany , where politicians of every stripe are mulling integration .
-lrb- nov .
16 , 2004 -rrb- tough times for muslims in europe a report by human-rights watchdogs confirms something many europeans may have noticed on their own : life has gotten harder for muslims in europe since the terror attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
-lrb- march 14 , 2005 -rrb- greater surveillance of german muslims ?
conservative german politicians thursday called for increased surveillance of germany 's muslim community following the revelations that the london terrorist attacks last week were likely carried out by british muslims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2005 how corrupt is german business ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a logo associated with quality is now tarnished by corruption corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt . a sports reporter is awaiting trial while the executives of two major companies resigned as a result of suspicion of bribery .
the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2005 the winding ways of an unequal rivalry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich and armstrong : the texan always had the upper hand if everything goes as expected , lance armstrong will celebrate his seventh consecutive tour de france victory on sunday .
over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .

over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .

following the attacks in london , some are vowing to crack down harder . for many investigators , they are the water that germinates a seed of discontent into full-grown hate for the western world . at the very latest since the sept .
11 attacks in america , european imams have been on police authorities ' watch list .
investigators are quick to crack down on those who are found to preach anti-semitism and praise terrorist attacks in their friday sermons .
several have been deported from european countries , such as italy , france and great britain , and many governments have tightened their laws regarding imams following the train bombings in madrid in 2004 and the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh last fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " jama masjid mosque " in london but now there 's talk of cracking down even harder , at least in great britain , which sports some of the continent 's most rigid anti-terror laws .
the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .
in 2004 , the government attempted to deport five imams .
a new clause to current french immigration laws allows for deportation if a foreigner is judged to have incited discrimination , hatred or violence against a person or group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy earlier this year the interior ministry set up regional intelligence offices in order to monitor support for islamic extremism .
following the london attacks on july 7 , interior minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said he is prepared to strip imams who preach violence of their french nationality . following the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh allegedly by a muslim extremist with dutch nationality last fall , the dutch government promised to come down hard on imams .
hard-line iimmigration minister rita verdonk got parliament to ban foreign imams from 2008 on .
in order to have some control over what is being taught , the government introduced state-sponsored training courses for imams .
but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam .

police ruled out a terrorist attack . the single-engined plane hit the grassy ground between the two structures and burst into flames shortly after 8:30 pm -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- , around 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from schröder 's chancellery and 300 meters from the parliament building .
no one was injured . the cause of the crash was not immediately known , but indications suggested that the pilot committed suicide .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart körting rushed to the crash site shortly after news of the incident broke , but ruled out a terrorist act . " there is no indication at this time that this could be a terrorist act , " he said , adding that the crash could be an accident or a suicide . a nosedive a police officer said the plane probably took off from an airfield in brandenburg state which surrounds berlin . witnesses said the single-engine plane flew over the parliament 's futuristic glass cupola before nosediving to the ground and going up in flames . alfred kosel , a 52-year-old tourist , described the aircraft as " a small propeller plane , similar to a world war i biplane ; it was also painted like those planes . i did n't hear the engine misfiring , nothing which would suggest engine trouble , " he said . suicide due to family problems ? the weekly focus magazine reported saturday that the crash was probably a dramatic suicide , reporting that the pilot was a refuse collector suspected of murdering his wife who has been missing for several days . the pilot was named as volker klawiter , 39 , who lived in the neighboring brandenburg district . by the time firefighters arrived at the scene the plane was already entirely destroyed by fire.police sealed off the area and the body was taken to a morgue for examination and formal identification . incident sparks security debate the incident , which led to much anxiety in the area around the parliament building in berlin on friday evening , has triggered a hot security debate in the german capital . overflights of the capital by small planes are authorized but an investigation will be carried out to determine how the aircraft could get close to sensitive buildings such as the parliament and the chancellery . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein urged a " urgent ban on overflights all year long " at " politically sensitive places " in germany .
brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm called the incident " a unbelievable security gap " and said that airspace monitoring had to be adapted to make sure that no flying object could slip through . but berlin 's körting was sceptical .
he said that " absolute security " could only be guaranteed if one slapped a ban on flying in a radius of about 100-200 kilometers around berlin , adding that such a ban would mean that all airports in berlin would have to be closed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security debate erupts in germany a debate has erupted in germany about the political consequences of the london bombings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2005 how corrupt is german business ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a logo associated with quality is now tarnished by corruption corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt . a sports reporter is awaiting trial while the executives of two major companies resigned as a result of suspicion of bribery .
the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .
but due to early elections this fall , this may have trouble getting off the ground . monika lohmüller -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .
the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 .

it was long considered the springboard for west germany 's postwar economic miracle .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws .

but , it 's worse if you 're a celebrity and then not have the adoring crowds to cheer you on . that 's exactly what happened to joseph or joe jackson , father of popstar icon michael jackson , who had to contend with cutting the cake minus the usual glitz at the estrel hotel in berlin 's immigrant-dominated neukölln neighborhood on friday evening .
among his brood of nine , only one , jermaine , showed up .
the others , including michael , janet and latoya , stayed away . the absence of michael seemed to have also turned off the fans - instead of the expected 1,000 , just a few hundred appeared .
many of them wore t-shirts reading " michael is innocent . " many also seemed disappointed by the evening 's events .
while the jacksons and a few dozen invited celebrities feasted on a four course menu by candlelight , the fans behind the barricades had to pay for their hotdogs themselves . even expected celebrities like mike tyson and liz taylor were nowhere to be seen .
instead , a few german singers and ex-boxers wandered around on the red carpet . birthday boy joe however thanked the german fans for their support during michael 's trying trial in california where he was acquitted of child sex abuse charges .
son jermaine added : " thank-you for all your love and prayers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2005 the winding ways of an unequal rivalry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich and armstrong : the texan always had the upper hand if everything goes as expected , lance armstrong will celebrate his seventh consecutive tour de france victory on sunday .
over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich .
-lrb- july 25 , 2004 -rrb- tour de france is a financial tour de force the tour de france attracts over 15 million spectators to the streets with a further billion happy to watch at home .
no wonder it 's become one of the sporting world 's biggest businesses .

the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2005 the winding ways of an unequal rivalry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich and armstrong : the texan always had the upper hand if everything goes as expected , lance armstrong will celebrate his seventh consecutive tour de france victory on sunday .
over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .

but , it 's worse if you 're a celebrity and then not have the adoring crowds to cheer you on . that 's exactly what happened to joseph or joe jackson , father of popstar icon michael jackson , who had to contend with cutting the cake minus the usual glitz at the estrel hotel in berlin 's immigrant-dominated neukölln neighborhood on friday evening .
among his brood of nine , only one , jermaine , showed up .
the others , including michael , janet and latoya , stayed away . the absence of michael seemed to have also turned off the fans - instead of the expected 1,000 , just a few hundred appeared .
many of them wore t-shirts reading " michael is innocent . " many also seemed disappointed by the evening 's events .
while the jacksons and a few dozen invited celebrities feasted on a four course menu by candlelight , the fans behind the barricades had to pay for their hotdogs themselves . even expected celebrities like mike tyson and liz taylor were nowhere to be seen .
instead , a few german singers and ex-boxers wandered around on the red carpet . birthday boy joe however thanked the german fans for their support during michael 's trying trial in california where he was acquitted of child sex abuse charges .

over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2005 how corrupt is german business ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a logo associated with quality is now tarnished by corruption corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt . a sports reporter is awaiting trial while the executives of two major companies resigned as a result of suspicion of bribery .
the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .
but due to early elections this fall , this may have trouble getting off the ground . monika lohmüller -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .
the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 .
-lrb- july 19 , 2005 -rrb- vw scandal puts pressure on works council the growing bribery scandal at volkswagen has led critics to challenge the system of co-determination in labor relations .
it was long considered the springboard for west germany 's postwar economic miracle .

" according to current information , german tourists were among those hurt , " schröder said in a statement , without giving a precise number . schröder condemned the attacks , which he said " showed disdain for human life " and which had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike . the horrible attacks of recent weeks demand even more intensive international cooperation , in order to dismantle terrorist networks that are even more cruel , " the german chancellor said . the al qaeda organisation in the levant and egypt said it carried out the multiple bombings in an internet statement buts its authenticity could not be verified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel after the blast at least three bomb blasts rocked the town in quick succession shortly after 1:00 am -lrb- 2200 gmt friday -rrb- .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .
but due to early elections this fall , this may have trouble getting off the ground . monika lohmüller -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .
the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 .
-lrb- july 19 , 2005 -rrb- vw scandal puts pressure on works council the growing bribery scandal at volkswagen has led critics to challenge the system of co-determination in labor relations .
it was long considered the springboard for west germany 's postwar economic miracle .
-lrb- july 7 , 2005 -rrb- the german problem with corruption a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .
experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws .

" according to current information , german tourists were among those hurt , " schröder said in a statement , without giving a precise number . schröder condemned the attacks , which he said " showed disdain for human life " and which had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike . the horrible attacks of recent weeks demand even more intensive international cooperation , in order to dismantle terrorist networks that are even more cruel , " the german chancellor said . the al qaeda organisation in the levant and egypt said it carried out the multiple bombings in an internet statement buts its authenticity could not be verified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel after the blast at least three bomb blasts rocked the town in quick succession shortly after 1:00 am -lrb- 2200 gmt friday -rrb- .

it was huge .
there were still lots of people at terraces and shops were still open , " said ashraf , who owns a nearby restaurant popular with russian tourists .
" i ca n't tell how many people were killed but it was carnage .
the panic was immediate and i saw a man die of a heart attack following the blasts . " the attacks came on the 53rd anniversary of the 1952 revolution that saw the overthrow of the monarchy as egyptians enjoyed an extended holiday weekend . eu voices horror at attacks un secretary general kofi annan reacted with " sorrow and anger , " , while us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who was in the region , condemned the " senseless " attacks . the european commission on saturday voiced horror at the " cowardly " suicide car bombings in egypt 's tourist-packed red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .

the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment .

police ruled out a terrorist attack . the single-engined plane hit the grassy ground between the two structures and burst into flames shortly after 8:30 pm -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- , around 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from schröder 's chancellery and 300 meters from the parliament building .
no one was injured . the cause of the crash was not immediately known , but indications suggested that the pilot committed suicide .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart körting rushed to the crash site shortly after news of the incident broke , but ruled out a terrorist act . " there is no indication at this time that this could be a terrorist act , " he said , adding that the crash could be an accident or a suicide . a nosedive a police officer said the plane probably took off from an airfield in brandenburg state which surrounds berlin . witnesses said the single-engine plane flew over the parliament 's futuristic glass cupola before nosediving to the ground and going up in flames . alfred kosel , a 52-year-old tourist , described the aircraft as " a small propeller plane , similar to a world war i biplane ; it was also painted like those planes . i did n't hear the engine misfiring , nothing which would suggest engine trouble , " he said . suicide due to family problems ? the weekly focus magazine reported saturday that the crash was probably a dramatic suicide , reporting that the pilot was a refuse collector suspected of murdering his wife who has been missing for several days . the pilot was named as volker klawiter , 39 , who lived in the neighboring brandenburg district . by the time firefighters arrived at the scene the plane was already entirely destroyed by fire.police sealed off the area and the body was taken to a morgue for examination and formal identification . incident sparks security debate the incident , which led to much anxiety in the area around the parliament building in berlin on friday evening , has triggered a hot security debate in the german capital . overflights of the capital by small planes are authorized but an investigation will be carried out to determine how the aircraft could get close to sensitive buildings such as the parliament and the chancellery . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein urged a " urgent ban on overflights all year long " at " politically sensitive places " in germany .
brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm called the incident " a unbelievable security gap " and said that airspace monitoring had to be adapted to make sure that no flying object could slip through . but berlin 's körting was sceptical .
he said that " absolute security " could only be guaranteed if one slapped a ban on flying in a radius of about 100-200 kilometers around berlin , adding that such a ban would mean that all airports in berlin would have to be closed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security debate erupts in germany a debate has erupted in germany about the political consequences of the london bombings .

" i can confirm a second man has been arrested , it was yesterday -lrb- friday -rrb- night , " a spokesman for london 's metropolitan police told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london the arrest took place in the same area of south london , stockwell , as a first suspect was apprehended earlier friday and a third man was shot dead by police in front of terrified onlookers . british newspapers saturday published grainy security camera stills showing four wanted men at or near the sites of thursday 's seemingly botched suicide attacks , as police urged the public to come forward with information . " find them " " find them , " screamed the huge-type headline in the tabloid daily mirror saturday . " the four most wanted , " said the independent , like every newspaper carrying pictures of the casually-dressed men in subway station tunnels or on a bus , one with a rucksack believed to have held his bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four suspected suicide bomber seen in this cctv image made available in london by the metropolitan police .
police , who were already gathering forensic evidence from the rucksacks and bombs that failed to explode , said they had received more than 400 calls following their appeal for help from the public . nerves were on edge in the british capital saturday .
mile end underground station in east london was briefly evacuated and closed after an unspecified alert , police said after they received information . on thursday , exactly a fortnight after four british muslim men killed themselves and 52 others in a co-ordinated series of blasts on three london subway trains and a bus , the new attackers attempted a repeat attack .
their detonators appeared to work but the explosive mix in their rucksacks failed to go off .
no-one was injured and the bombers fled the scenes . on friday morning , police cornered a man of ethnic asian origin inside a subway train at stockwell after a frantic chase .
screaming at onlookers to get out of the way , they pinned him down in a carriage and shot him at point-blank range . police refused to say whether the dead man had been carrying any explosives at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police shot and killed a man at a stockwell station on friday , soon after the stockwell shooting , police arrested a man under anti-terrorism laws after an armed raid on a nearby apartment block , and another was arrested around midnight .
both men were being held in a high security police station in central london in connection with the investigation into the attempted attacks on london 's transport network , police said . the first man was being held under a section of britain 's 2001 anti-terrorism law relating to the " commission , instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism " , a police spokeswoman told afp . british police in dilemma according to saturday 's edition of the sun newspaper , one of the detained men is one of the suspected bombers , whose device partially exploded thursday lunchtime on a number 26 bus in east london . " one down ... three to go , " was the headline on the tabloid 's front page , above a picture of the arrested man being driven away wearing a paper suit to protect potential evidence on his clothes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters read the morning headlines onboard the underground after thursday 's bomb attacks plunged the tube networks into chaos in london .
saturday 's newspapers noted the " deadly dilemma " now faced by british police in tackling suspects who might be carrying a suicide bomb . britons , who have only become accustomed to seeing their police armed in recent years , appeared to be torn between a sense of necessity and disquiet about the shooting by police .
some papers likened the police tactics to those used by israeli security forces in dealing with suicide bombers . london mayor ken livingstone said a " shoot-to-kill policy " was necessary for those suspected of carrying a bomb , and he had strong support from some quarters .
the daily express newspaper headlined : " shoot all bombers " . but the muslim council of britain demanded police explain their actions and said muslims feared reprisal attacks .
friday 's shooting at stockwell will be automatically investigated by the independent police complaints commission . the four men named by police as the july 7 suicide bombers were all muslim britons , three of pakistani origin .
the fourth was a muslim convert born in jamaica . a survey of british muslims in saturday 's daily telegraph newspaper found that only six percent thought the july 7 attacks were justified . however , when asked whether they had sympathy with the " feelings and motives " of the bombers , 13 percent said they had a lot of sympathy and a further 11 percent had a little . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london police kill suspect , arrest two others london police shot and killed a suspected suicide bomber on a northern line underground train station on friday and arrested two others in connection with thursday 's explosions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2005 how corrupt is german business ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a logo associated with quality is now tarnished by corruption corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt . a sports reporter is awaiting trial while the executives of two major companies resigned as a result of suspicion of bribery .
the events of the past two weeks give the impression that a dark wave of corruption has washed over once pure-as-snow germany .
but that is not backed up by statistics .
in fact , germany is pretty clean compared to other nations .
the latest corruption index published by berlin-based transparency international puts germany in the top 20 in its ranking of least corrupt countries . still , corruption is n't just a financial , managerial or image problem for companies engulfed by scandals , it also hurts the economy , experts say . " when we can reach the level of finland -lrb- ranked as the least corrupt country -rrb- , that then means that we are ensuring that contracts go to the most qualified companies and not to those who give the best bribes , and that those projects are worthy ones , not just created to line someone 's pockets , " said johann graf lambsdorff , a economics professor in passau who compiles the annual corruption index for transparency international .
" reaching this level also means about six percent higher income for the average employee . " more corporate scandals recently two more corporate scandals made headlines .
this week , munich prosecutors confirmed that a top manager at chipmaker infineon took more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 304,000 -rrb- in kickbacks for motor sports contracts , and the company 's management allegedly knew about it since 2004 .
that came on the heels of a bribery and corruption scandal at carmaker volkswagen which has cost three high-level executives and the head of the company 's works council their jobs .
the allegations include contract kickbacks and payments to work council members for luxury trips and even prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former infineon coo andreas von zitzewitz is is accused of bribery still , many are taking it as a good sign that the latest scandals are out in the public even as others worry that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg .
lambsdorff says that the recent scandals at volkswagen and infineon show that german companies need to do more to fight corruption . " the point is that there needs to be very clear rules of conduct set down , " he said .
" there also needs to be a designated person to whom employees can turn to in order to report violations other than a supervisor who might be involved . " corruption fight needs to be targeted after major corporate scandals in the us , most notably that of energy company enron in 2001 , american companies began to create stronger internal controls and many created a chief security officer to oversee the function .
german firms , however , have n't yet made the fight against corruption a strategic goal , says thorsten mehles , a former police officer who heads a private company that advises large companies on such matters . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly needs to address these issues , say experts .
last year , two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club , tsv 1860 munich and the nation 's railway company deutsche bahn , made unwanted headlines for bribery and contract irregularities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international , right , and hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international germany , left , say more must be done to combat corruption and the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , said that the latest developments were unsurprising .
but he added that the exposure of cases like the 1860 munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .
" we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " conflict of interest another problem is that most of the boards that supervise companies are often made up of people who were once executives of the company .
as a result , experts say there is no way to separate management and supervisory functions . the result can be seen in the cases of volkswagen and infineon , where individuals are charged with attempting to enrich themselves .
that is to be expected when corruption is part of corporate politics , especially when there are public contracts to be had , says lambsdorff . " it is not right when a few individuals from a company are jailed and the company still receives lucrative contracts , " he said .
" instead , there needs to be a black list to which such corrupt companies are added .
then when they receive a contract , as punishment , they need to refund 10 percent of it as punishment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants a blacklist that punishes companies accused of corruption german economic minister wolfgang clement has already considered a " black list , " an anti-corruption register .
but due to early elections this fall , this may have trouble getting off the ground . monika lohmüller -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .
the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 .

over that span , his biggest foe has been jan ullrich . for cycling enthusiasts , the image of lance armstrong and jan ullrich at the base of alpe d 'huez in 2001 is probably branded in their memories .
the duel on the tenth stage had risen to a climactic pitch .
armstrong feigned fatigue on the first two climbs .
and then on the final ascent , armstrong threw a glance over his shoulder at ullrich and then took off , leaving the team telekom -lrb- later t-mobile -rrb- rider to get a good view of his back wheel - and then nothing as armstrong rambled up the mountain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's crash was one of the highlights of the 2003 tour de france .
he would recover from the spill and win the tour armstrong took that stage an absolutely amazing two minutes ahead of ullrich , sealing the fate of the german cyclist in 2001 , and in fact , for the next four years .
lance armstrong could quite conceivably go down as the greatest rider in the history of the sport with his seven straight victories .
and jan ullrich was on three of those occasions the bridesmaid , second place .
this year , the german cyclist has jumped to third .
promising start for rostock-born ullrich jan ullrich was born on december 2 , 1973 in rostock , germany .
trained in the east german sports training tradition , he showed great promise as a bike rider .
the great successes came early .
in 1996 , he finished second to teammate bjarne riis at the tour , and many speculated openly that he could have beaten his captain .
as a junior member on the squad , though , team leaders ordered the team to fight for riis and ullrich demurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich winning the 1997 tour de france the next year , the favor was returned and jan ullrich won his first , and only , tour de france , becoming the first , and only , german to win the cycling world 's most prestigious race .
after one victory , there was talk of ullrich becoming a tour de force on the tour .
but that would n't come to be .
in the coming years , armstrong would receive the accolades and the early tours in the new millennium would be dominated by the rivalry between armstrong and ullrich .
the armstrong years in 2000 and 2001 , ullrich would have to look up to the american on the winner 's podium .
the texan had won three in a row .
ullrich would no longer be the legend , but rather lance armstrong .
problems with his weight , what many people described as a lack of dedication to training and incidents with alcohol and ecstasy off the bike dogged ullrich in 2002 .
many thought his career was over .
a case of much potential that never blossomed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his year with team bianchi brought ullrich back into the bike racing spotlight his contract with german team telekom cancelled , he got back up on his wheeled-horse and signed a deal with the little-known team bianchi for 2003 .
that year , he surprised the field .
armstrong was struggling to win his record-tying fifth tour .
ullrich was back in the headlines .
but he fell short again , coming in second place and watching armstrong make history .
return to t-mobile in 2004 , ullrich returned to t-mobile .
it was a bittersweet move after being ostracized by the team in 2002 .
the hopes of germany rested on the 1997 winner but surprisingly his teammate andreas klöden finished third , one spot ahead of ullrich .
the winner , well , we know who that was .
2005 , lance armstrong 's final year to race in france on the tour was the final chance for ullrich to extract a bit of revenge .
yet the fighting spirit mandatory to beat that ferocious tiger named lance armstrong was missing .
or was just never there .
" jan wo n't ever win again , " was the harsh assessment from former teammate riis .
" he ca n't push himself hard enough anymore .
he does n't try anything new . "
many people , fans , journalists and experts wondered why he could n't respond to the attacks of armstrong on the mountains .
but it might be better to ask why should jan ullrich be the only one to respond ?
no one could .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong during one of his ceremonious rides on the final stage through paris there has n't been a rider like lance armstrong in the history of professional cycling .
and may well never be .
so finishing second three times to the best is not the worst accomplishment .
and those close to the sport agree the criticism is unfair .
" he 's got everything that we all like - he 's a human being with weaknesses like us all .
i 'd be happy to have him on my team , " hans holczer , head of the gerolsteiner team told reuters .
when the tour de france ends on sunday , armstrong will exit the stage . maybe just maybe , then 32-year old ullrich can win his second tour de france . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong makes history in paris , german accompanies him lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .

" i can confirm a second man has been arrested , it was yesterday -lrb- friday -rrb- night , " a spokesman for london 's metropolitan police told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand outside stockwell station , in london the arrest took place in the same area of south london , stockwell , as a first suspect was apprehended earlier friday and a third man was shot dead by police in front of terrified onlookers . british newspapers saturday published grainy security camera stills showing four wanted men at or near the sites of thursday 's seemingly botched suicide attacks , as police urged the public to come forward with information . " find them " " find them , " screamed the huge-type headline in the tabloid daily mirror saturday . " the four most wanted , " said the independent , like every newspaper carrying pictures of the casually-dressed men in subway station tunnels or on a bus , one with a rucksack believed to have held his bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four suspected suicide bomber seen in this cctv image made available in london by the metropolitan police .
police , who were already gathering forensic evidence from the rucksacks and bombs that failed to explode , said they had received more than 400 calls following their appeal for help from the public . nerves were on edge in the british capital saturday .
mile end underground station in east london was briefly evacuated and closed after an unspecified alert , police said after they received information . on thursday , exactly a fortnight after four british muslim men killed themselves and 52 others in a co-ordinated series of blasts on three london subway trains and a bus , the new attackers attempted a repeat attack .
their detonators appeared to work but the explosive mix in their rucksacks failed to go off .
no-one was injured and the bombers fled the scenes . on friday morning , police cornered a man of ethnic asian origin inside a subway train at stockwell after a frantic chase .
screaming at onlookers to get out of the way , they pinned him down in a carriage and shot him at point-blank range . police refused to say whether the dead man had been carrying any explosives at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police shot and killed a man at a stockwell station on friday , soon after the stockwell shooting , police arrested a man under anti-terrorism laws after an armed raid on a nearby apartment block , and another was arrested around midnight .
both men were being held in a high security police station in central london in connection with the investigation into the attempted attacks on london 's transport network , police said . the first man was being held under a section of britain 's 2001 anti-terrorism law relating to the " commission , instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism " , a police spokeswoman told afp . british police in dilemma according to saturday 's edition of the sun newspaper , one of the detained men is one of the suspected bombers , whose device partially exploded thursday lunchtime on a number 26 bus in east london .

saturday 's newspapers noted the " deadly dilemma " now faced by british police in tackling suspects who might be carrying a suicide bomb . britons , who have only become accustomed to seeing their police armed in recent years , appeared to be torn between a sense of necessity and disquiet about the shooting by police .
some papers likened the police tactics to those used by israeli security forces in dealing with suicide bombers . london mayor ken livingstone said a " shoot-to-kill policy " was necessary for those suspected of carrying a bomb , and he had strong support from some quarters .
the daily express newspaper headlined : " shoot all bombers " . but the muslim council of britain demanded police explain their actions and said muslims feared reprisal attacks .
friday 's shooting at stockwell will be automatically investigated by the independent police complaints commission . the four men named by police as the july 7 suicide bombers were all muslim britons , three of pakistani origin .
the fourth was a muslim convert born in jamaica . a survey of british muslims in saturday 's daily telegraph newspaper found that only six percent thought the july 7 attacks were justified . however , when asked whether they had sympathy with the " feelings and motives " of the bombers , 13 percent said they had a lot of sympathy and a further 11 percent had a little . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london police kill suspect , arrest two others london police shot and killed a suspected suicide bomber on a northern line underground train station on friday and arrested two others in connection with thursday 's explosions .

police ruled out a terrorist attack . the single-engined plane hit the grassy ground between the two structures and burst into flames shortly after 8:30 pm -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- , around 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from schröder 's chancellery and 300 meters from the parliament building .
no one was injured . the cause of the crash was not immediately known , but indications suggested that the pilot committed suicide .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart körting rushed to the crash site shortly after news of the incident broke , but ruled out a terrorist act . " there is no indication at this time that this could be a terrorist act , " he said , adding that the crash could be an accident or a suicide . a nosedive a police officer said the plane probably took off from an airfield in brandenburg state which surrounds berlin . witnesses said the single-engine plane flew over the parliament 's futuristic glass cupola before nosediving to the ground and going up in flames . alfred kosel , a 52-year-old tourist , described the aircraft as " a small propeller plane , similar to a world war i biplane ; it was also painted like those planes . i did n't hear the engine misfiring , nothing which would suggest engine trouble , " he said . suicide due to family problems ? the weekly focus magazine reported saturday that the crash was probably a dramatic suicide , reporting that the pilot was a refuse collector suspected of murdering his wife who has been missing for several days . the pilot was named as volker klawiter , 39 , who lived in the neighboring brandenburg district . by the time firefighters arrived at the scene the plane was already entirely destroyed by fire.police sealed off the area and the body was taken to a morgue for examination and formal identification . incident sparks security debate the incident , which led to much anxiety in the area around the parliament building in berlin on friday evening , has triggered a hot security debate in the german capital . overflights of the capital by small planes are authorized but an investigation will be carried out to determine how the aircraft could get close to sensitive buildings such as the parliament and the chancellery . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein urged a " urgent ban on overflights all year long " at " politically sensitive places " in germany .
brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm called the incident " a unbelievable security gap " and said that airspace monitoring had to be adapted to make sure that no flying object could slip through . but berlin 's körting was sceptical .
he said that " absolute security " could only be guaranteed if one slapped a ban on flying in a radius of about 100-200 kilometers around berlin , adding that such a ban would mean that all airports in berlin would have to be closed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security debate erupts in germany a debate has erupted in germany about the political consequences of the london bombings .

following the attacks in london , some are vowing to crack down harder . for many investigators , they are the water that germinates a seed of discontent into full-grown hate for the western world . at the very latest since the sept .
11 attacks in america , european imams have been on police authorities ' watch list .
investigators are quick to crack down on those who are found to preach anti-semitism and praise terrorist attacks in their friday sermons .
several have been deported from european countries , such as italy , france and great britain , and many governments have tightened their laws regarding imams following the train bombings in madrid in 2004 and the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh last fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " jama masjid mosque " in london but now there 's talk of cracking down even harder , at least in great britain , which sports some of the continent 's most rigid anti-terror laws .
the government of tony blair has had the right since 2003 to remove british nationality from dual-nationality foreigners deemed to represent a threat to the country .
this law was applied in the case of the radical preacher abu hamza al-masri . now they are considering strengthening anti-terrorist laws to make " indirect incitement " to terrorism an offense . france tough on imams something akin to this is already in place in france , where the strict separation of church and states makes it easier for authorities to crack down on imams .
in 2004 , the government attempted to deport five imams .
a new clause to current french immigration laws allows for deportation if a foreigner is judged to have incited discrimination , hatred or violence against a person or group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy earlier this year the interior ministry set up regional intelligence offices in order to monitor support for islamic extremism .
following the london attacks on july 7 , interior minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said he is prepared to strip imams who preach violence of their french nationality . following the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh allegedly by a muslim extremist with dutch nationality last fall , the dutch government promised to come down hard on imams .
hard-line iimmigration minister rita verdonk got parliament to ban foreign imams from 2008 on .
in order to have some control over what is being taught , the government introduced state-sponsored training courses for imams .
but only a few have so far signed up . in belgium the interior ministry has set up a network of information-gathering on radical islam , with 58 anti-terrorist experts reinforcing police in the main cities . austria , where five percent of the population are muslim , recently toughened its legislation by making possible the expulsion of imams whose sermons are " a danger to public security . " germany has deportation problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theal-nur mosque in berlin a law which came into effect on january 1 in germany should in theory make it easier to expel " spiritual inciters to disorder " but the procedures are proving cumbersome .
recently the constitutional court blocked the deportation of an imam who described germans as " useless , stinking atheists . " spain , which was hit by islamist terrorism in march 2004 , has no specific legislation to track imams who preach violence .
there is still no official register of imams or muslim places of worship . however , last week the interior minister appeared to signal future toughening of the law when he said that spain " can not tolerate sermons which help fertilize terrorism . " " jewel of islam " sitting in norway italy , which is exposed to the risk of islamist terrorism because of its military presence in iraq , does not have specific laws either .
the interior minister can ask for the expulsion of an imam , but this can be appealed before the courts . several other countries , especially in northern europe , have also chosen not to institute changes to their legislation , preferring to treat each case under existing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar norway , for example , has for two years been seeking the legal means to expel mullah krekar , an iraqi kurd who founded the extremist group ansar al-islam and has been described by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden as a " jewel of islam . " dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holland prompts soul-searching in germany as is the case in other parts of europe , the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh has prompted some serious soul-searching in germany , where politicians of every stripe are mulling integration .

the resort is popular with british holidaymakers and the foreign office says britons are among the casualties .
british eyewitnesses have described the carnage and confusion of the immediate aftermath of the attacks .
fabio basone , in naama bay hard rock cafe there was shrapnel everywhere .
the front of the hotel had been completely blown away , a couple of bodies were lying down on the front of the road - i 've no idea if they were alive or if they were severely injured .
i 've never been so scared in the whole of my life samantha hardcastle britons caught in egypt blasts but the scene there was just absolutely devastating .
people were just trying to run in any direction they could , to get out of the situation , but no-one quite sure where to go .
we were met by an onslaught of people running up the road .
then we were met by screaming people running up the road the other way .
i thought i might be safer out of london but it just goes to show anywhere can be a target .
samantha hardcastle , naama bay hotel there were two massive explosions that we felt - three or four minutes apart .
the first one went off and it shook the hotel we were in , and it was evident from the minute we heard the bang that it was a bomb - it was n't just a car backfiring .
then as we went into the hotel to grab our children , another explosion went off .
there 's obviously lots of smoke in the sky , and that seems to have settled down now .
it was in old sharm , which is a few miles from where we are .
but the shockwaves that came through were just horrendous .
there 's just an eerie sense of calm at the moment .
i 've never been so scared in the whole of my life .
pc charlie ives , who left london days after july 7 blasts my wife and i and two friends were in a street cafe about 50 metres from where the explosions happened .
two explosions within the space of four minutes .
it was getting difficult to see so we tried to get to a beach nearby to calm down .
it was mass hysteria really .
but a lot of people were gathering at a car park next to the beach and i was mindful that the attackers might have a planted a car bomb there .
i told people to go back to the safety of their hotel rooms .
you just hope that was the best thing to do .
i 've seen lots of -lrb- bad -rrb- things , as most met police officers really have .
but to be 50 metres away from two huge explosions , words really do fail me .
richard bonneville , working in local hotel it was something like ten past one and so i was sleeping .
i thought we had an earthquake - because our hotel is maybe about 100 metres from the bomb in the old sharm .
then after about 15 minutes i learned that it was a bomb .
i hear that one hotel in naama bay has been completely destroyed .
this is an hotel of 175 rooms , so i guess there are a lot of people dead - a lot .

speaking on bbc radio ulster 's inside politics , mr ervine also revealed that the uvf has stopped debating whether it will follow the ira into a new mode .
he said the uvf had been consulting on its future but has put the debate about going into a new peaceful mode on hold .
the east belfast assembly member said the organisation was intent on " dealing with " the lvf .
two lives have been claimed in the dispute between the paramilitary ulster volunteer force and loyalist volunteer force groupings .
mr ervine said the uvf suspected the lvf was being controlled by the intelligence services which are " deliberately agitating " within unionism .
he also condemned the independent monitoring commission which has recommended sanctions against his party for failing to stop the violence .
the pup leader dismissed the imc as a " sick joke " .
northern ireland secretary peter hain has said he intended to withhold the pup 's assembly allowances for another year because of its links to the uvf and red hand commando .
