you might hear germans talk of going " shoppen " at their local " discounter , " enjoying a little " flirten " at a party for " singles , " or attending a " meeting " with the " management " at work . this mish-mash of deutsch and english is referred to by germans as " denglish , " and while many people think it 's cool , the small town of mühlhausen in thuringia think it ought to be verbote n . at the end of october , the town became a card-carrying member of the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- , a self-appointed watchdog intent on keeping german unsullied by outside influences . starti n g at home but before the city can declare itself cleansed of denglish , it has a lot of work to do , starting with the city 's official web site .
press spokeswoman angelika bergmann , whose job it is to maintain the site , admitted there is room for improvement .
the " home " button should be renamed " startseite , " for example .
bergmann is still looking for a good german alternative for the site 's " newsletter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the signs at this sandwich bar , you would n't know it was located in germany outside city hall , officials are hoping to wean mühlhausen residents off commonly used english words such as " city , " " shuttlebus , " and " recycling , " in favor of their german equivalents . bergmann is counting on the cooperation of shopkeepers in particular , to rid the city of one of her pet peeves - posters in shop windows that read " sale " instead of " schlussverkauf . " " where there are german words for the english term , they should be used , " said bergmann , whose aim is to make communication simpler and more effective for the people of mühlhausen . to that end , denglish is n't the only linguistic element that is getting an overhaul - the brand of complicated bureaucratic german favored by civil servants will also be " translated " into german that the average person can understand . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish dw-world has compiled some stories on denglish .
as one german perfume store 's " english " slogan put it until recently -lrb- when it was replaced by a german one -rrb- : " come in and find out ! "
europe battles english invasion fast becoming europe 's lingua franca , english has invaded other national languages .
the trend has some on the continent worried that languages might in the future take second place even within their countries of origin .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- opinion : desperately ditching denglish after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue .
-lrb- nov .
15 , 2004 -rrb- feedback is denglish acceptable in your view , or should it be banned ?

" " unique role of the us " us diplomats said the agreement essentially endorses the status quo . the accord " preserved the unique role of the us government in ensuring the reliability and stability of the internet , " top us negotiator david gross said wednesday . " it took no action with regard to existing institutions including icann .
it created no new international organizations , " added gross , the us coordinator for international communications and information policy . the deal also foresees the creation of an internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- for an initial five-year term to hold talks on all internet issues , including problems such as spam , cyber crime and computer viruses . the igf , which greece has offered to host , will also be allowed to " build on the existing structures of internet governance " but has no concrete powers . un under secretary general for communications shashi tharoor said an agreement on internet governance was " crucial " to continue to build on freedom of expression on the global process .

only the menu and the slight accent to the singing suggest that this is not a pub somewhere in the heart of england .
this is düsseldorf , the crowd is predominantly german and everyone is pumped by the fact that oasis is in town . shouting over another refrain , a number of the assembled choir of would-be vocalists try and explain what it is about the band that the germans love . " liam gallagher .
all anyone could want in life , " said one girl . " shoes , haircuts and guitars , " said her male companion . but what is it really about oasis , a band brimming with traditional working class machismo and the potential for violence and mayhem made famous by the likes of the who and led zeppelin , which appeals to the germans ? thomas venker , editor-in-chief at german music monthly magazine intro said he thinks it 's just that volatility that attracts german fans . " markus kavka -lrb- mtv germany presenter -rrb- once said that , for him , oasis made him feel like it was okay to be both a man and an indie boy , " venker said .
" it was okay to listen to those student sounds and also drink beer and talk about football .
oasis brought that attitude to germany and many people tuned into that . " breaki n g the pop mo n oto n y " oasis brought us serious music about human emotions , " said one fan queuing for the band 's phillipshalle gig .
" they crashed the bravo hits party and trampled on all that commercial and fake rubbish germans had been fed by music channels for so long . " bildunterschrift : germany is a regular stop on the oasis european tour schedule . oasis is just one of many british bands that continue to enjoy commercial and critical success in germany despite the emergence of a strong german music scene over the last two years . but a tradition of well-received musical acts from the uk actually stretches back decades . " a lot of british bands in the sixties had big followings in germany , " andy bell , bass player with oasis , told dw-world .
" some were massive in germany way before they were popular back home .
many even released stuff on german labels that did n't come out in england . " beatlema n ia bega n i n germa n y " the popularity of british bands in germany has a lot to do with the beatles , i think , " said gem archer , the band 's rhythm guitarist .
" everyone back in britain thought they were german . " the legacy of the beatles ' time in germany and the affection the germans continue to have for the fab four can still be seen in the list of records the band still holds in the german charts including most number one singles and most number one albums . but surely a merseybeat four-piece with a talent for catchy pop songs can not be solely credited for breaching cultural barriers and instilling a love of music from a country with such a different mentality and identity from that of the germans . heal wartime scars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german music fans continue to embrace british music .
" after the war , germans were looking for a new start , " said cultural theorist eckhard schumacher from the university of munich .
" for german youth , music from britain was foreign and new ; something very different from the culture of their parents ' past which everyone wanted to move on from .
it was also a way to connect with another country 's youth and undermine the idea of being enemies … and popular music has always been about connecting people . " popular culture author anne schönberg said the connection formed in the immediate post-war years is still strong .
" much is made of the differences between the british and the germans but very little is said of their similarities .
culturally , they are both very expressive and creative societies .
the germans have a respect for that . " germa n s more accepti n g tha n the british however , she said , the exchange is almost a one-way street . " the germans have taken on more of britain 's popular culture than the other way round , " she said .
" german youth see british music as a dominant and exciting force , presented in a language that most have an understanding of .
the opposite can be said of british youth . " this is reflected in the current music charts where five of the top 10 german singles and nine of the top 20 albums are from uk acts .
no german artists appear in either chart in britain .

computer games enthusiasts could be among those doing the moaning . the coalition has grand plans for the future of germany 's youngsters , who they say should grow up in a society without violence .
that naturally means looking at ways of reducing child neglect and abuse , but the government wants to take its vision of harmony several steps further and has proposed the abolition of games which simulate brutal killings . games like " counterstrike " have in been on the hit list of titles to be removed from gaming shop shelves ever since a pupil at a school in the german town of erfurt ran amok , shooting 16 people before turning his weapon on himself . it 's a long , slow burning issue .
as with films , computer and video games are already certificated based on the age group to which they are suited , but that is not enough for the new lawmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kid 's stuff ?
andreas scheuer , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union , who is in charge of youth protection , told the online version of der spiegel magazine that violent killing games " have no place in germany 's bedrooms . " he said that parents should take responsibility for the games their children play , but that the government should do its bit to help less media-competent adults by introducing a " complete ban . " i n dustry oppositio n but with access to pretty much any software little more than a mouse-click away , it is hard to imagine exactly how such a ban should , or could be enforced .
and nobody is talking about that just now . understandably , the industry is opposed to the abolition of some of its best-sellers . olaf wolters , manager of the german interactive entertainment software association told spiegel that they wanted to work in close connection with the incoming government , adding that there was some unfortunate vocabulary in the coalition pact . " as far as we are concerned , there are no such things as killer games , but adult games , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty .

targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .
" the building of bridges between peoples and communities is never done , " matsuura said .
" we may physically restore a destroyed bridge but the real task is not over then .
the real task is to build a lasting peace .
let the old bridge at mostar become a symbol everywhere of that enduring challenge . " helle jeppesen -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne cathedral to be spared blight by skyscrapers unesco said friday it was likely to remove cologne cathedral from its list of world heritage in danger because a construction project that would have obscured views of the building looks set to be scaled down or shelved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2005 future foreign minister says germany to stay out of iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is promising steady continuity in future foreign policy germany 's incoming foreign minister steinmeier has ruled out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly on iraq .
but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy .

that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .
experts say the system is faster and more efficient , thus reducing the number of false alarms .

" at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .
that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .
experts say the system is faster and more efficient , thus reducing the number of false alarms . " in seven or eight minutes we can process the data in order to be able to say with certainty whether a tsunami has erupted , " jörn lauterjung , head of the project told news agency dpa . " dangerous , seismological zone " one of the challenges facing scientists aboard the research vessel " sonne " is to determine where exactly the buoys should be released . accurate information about the makeup of the ocean bed is hard to get and over the past weeks , researchers have been trying to assess it onboard their ship , and feeding the findings to computer graphics program . the result has been graphic images of gigantic , jagged underwater mountain ranges with staggeringly different heights , spanning thousands of meters where the eurasian and indo australian plates meet and make up the notorious sunda straits . bildunterschrift : an image from the potsdam-based research center shows the sumatra quake that 's exactly where a massive build-up of energy is believed to have taken place , which first sparked an earthquake near the northern tip of sumatra , in turn triggering the tsunami last december . " the sunda straits is one of the most dangerous seismological zones of the world , " lauterjung said . that 's the reason the scientists have decided to concentrate on the region .
in particular , they plan to follow the course of the straits southwards where experts fear pent-up energy on overlapping plates still has n't been released - something , they say , could have deadly consequences . scientists plan to work up north to banda aceh after the sunda straits .
but the project is not expected to be completely finished and functioning until 2008 . it 's hoped that will provide enough time to train indonesian experts in the new system . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indonesia imports german tsunami warning model indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2005 future foreign minister says germany to stay out of iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is promising steady continuity in future foreign policy germany 's incoming foreign minister steinmeier has ruled out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly on iraq .
but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .
a privileged partnership is not described as a goal . " dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say merkel will bring change in style , not policy for us germany finally has a coalition deal , paving the way for angela merkel to become chancellor .
experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes .
-lrb- nov.13 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's new face abroad frank-walter steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor schröder , is set to be germany 's new foreign minister .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .
a privileged partnership is not described as a goal .

the deal cleared the way for the summit to focus on the digital divide between rich and poor nations . however , it left intact the united states ' single-handed control over the private body known as the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- that oversees the key technical and administrative roots of the internet . the eleventh-hour agreement sidestepped a brewing row between the us and the rest of the world , which officials warned could have seen the internet torn into competing or disconnected networks .
us control of the domain-name system that guides online traffic had become a sticking point for the european union as well as several countries such as iran and brazil , who argued that it should be managed by the united nations or some other global body . to mollify those bodies pushing for more international control , diplomats agreed to set up multilateral talks , including an open-ended process " towards enhanced cooperation -lrb- by -rrb- relevant international organizations " on oversight and public policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , speaks during the summit 's opening session the new process will be triggered by un secretary general kofi annan in the first quarter of 2006 , according to the final draft , but it set no target for an outcome . the eu said in a statement that the agreement would lead to " further internationalization of internet governance , and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end . " " unique role of the us " us diplomats said the agreement essentially endorses the status quo . the accord " preserved the unique role of the us government in ensuring the reliability and stability of the internet , " top us negotiator david gross said wednesday . " it took no action with regard to existing institutions including icann .
it created no new international organizations , " added gross , the us coordinator for international communications and information policy . the deal also foresees the creation of an internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- for an initial five-year term to hold talks on all internet issues , including problems such as spam , cyber crime and computer viruses . the igf , which greece has offered to host , will also be allowed to " build on the existing structures of internet governance " but has no concrete powers . un under secretary general for communications shashi tharoor said an agreement on internet governance was " crucial " to continue to build on freedom of expression on the global process . " we need more voices in the process and we need more voices on the net , " tharoor told journalists . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us at loggerheads over internet control the us and europe are headed for a showdown at a worldwide internet summit in tunisia this week .

" we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said .

you might hear germans talk of going " shoppen " at their local " discounter , " enjoying a little " flirten " at a party for " singles , " or attending a " meeting " with the " management " at work . this mish-mash of deutsch and english is referred to by germans as " denglish , " and while many people think it 's cool , the small town of mühlhausen in thuringia think it ought to be verbote n . at the end of october , the town became a card-carrying member of the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- , a self-appointed watchdog intent on keeping german unsullied by outside influences . starti n g at home but before the city can declare itself cleansed of denglish , it has a lot of work to do , starting with the city 's official web site .
press spokeswoman angelika bergmann , whose job it is to maintain the site , admitted there is room for improvement .
the " home " button should be renamed " startseite , " for example .
bergmann is still looking for a good german alternative for the site 's " newsletter .

" " where there are german words for the english term , they should be used , " said bergmann , whose aim is to make communication simpler and more effective for the people of mühlhausen . to that end , denglish is n't the only linguistic element that is getting an overhaul - the brand of complicated bureaucratic german favored by civil servants will also be " translated " into german that the average person can understand . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish dw-world has compiled some stories on denglish .

" at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .

the deal cleared the way for the summit to focus on the digital divide between rich and poor nations . however , it left intact the united states ' single-handed control over the private body known as the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- that oversees the key technical and administrative roots of the internet . the eleventh-hour agreement sidestepped a brewing row between the us and the rest of the world , which officials warned could have seen the internet torn into competing or disconnected networks .
us control of the domain-name system that guides online traffic had become a sticking point for the european union as well as several countries such as iran and brazil , who argued that it should be managed by the united nations or some other global body . to mollify those bodies pushing for more international control , diplomats agreed to set up multilateral talks , including an open-ended process " towards enhanced cooperation -lrb- by -rrb- relevant international organizations " on oversight and public policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , speaks during the summit 's opening session the new process will be triggered by un secretary general kofi annan in the first quarter of 2006 , according to the final draft , but it set no target for an outcome . the eu said in a statement that the agreement would lead to " further internationalization of internet governance , and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end . " " unique role of the us " us diplomats said the agreement essentially endorses the status quo . the accord " preserved the unique role of the us government in ensuring the reliability and stability of the internet , " top us negotiator david gross said wednesday . " it took no action with regard to existing institutions including icann .
it created no new international organizations , " added gross , the us coordinator for international communications and information policy . the deal also foresees the creation of an internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- for an initial five-year term to hold talks on all internet issues , including problems such as spam , cyber crime and computer viruses . the igf , which greece has offered to host , will also be allowed to " build on the existing structures of internet governance " but has no concrete powers . un under secretary general for communications shashi tharoor said an agreement on internet governance was " crucial " to continue to build on freedom of expression on the global process . " we need more voices in the process and we need more voices on the net , " tharoor told journalists . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us at loggerheads over internet control the us and europe are headed for a showdown at a worldwide internet summit in tunisia this week .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .

" at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .
that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .
experts say the system is faster and more efficient , thus reducing the number of false alarms . " in seven or eight minutes we can process the data in order to be able to say with certainty whether a tsunami has erupted , " jörn lauterjung , head of the project told news agency dpa . " dangerous , seismological zone " one of the challenges facing scientists aboard the research vessel " sonne " is to determine where exactly the buoys should be released . accurate information about the makeup of the ocean bed is hard to get and over the past weeks , researchers have been trying to assess it onboard their ship , and feeding the findings to computer graphics program . the result has been graphic images of gigantic , jagged underwater mountain ranges with staggeringly different heights , spanning thousands of meters where the eurasian and indo australian plates meet and make up the notorious sunda straits . bildunterschrift : an image from the potsdam-based research center shows the sumatra quake that 's exactly where a massive build-up of energy is believed to have taken place , which first sparked an earthquake near the northern tip of sumatra , in turn triggering the tsunami last december . " the sunda straits is one of the most dangerous seismological zones of the world , " lauterjung said . that 's the reason the scientists have decided to concentrate on the region .
in particular , they plan to follow the course of the straits southwards where experts fear pent-up energy on overlapping plates still has n't been released - something , they say , could have deadly consequences . scientists plan to work up north to banda aceh after the sunda straits .
but the project is not expected to be completely finished and functioning until 2008 . it 's hoped that will provide enough time to train indonesian experts in the new system . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indonesia imports german tsunami warning model indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2005 future foreign minister says germany to stay out of iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is promising steady continuity in future foreign policy germany 's incoming foreign minister steinmeier has ruled out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly on iraq .
but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .
a privileged partnership is not described as a goal .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .
" the building of bridges between peoples and communities is never done , " matsuura said .
" we may physically restore a destroyed bridge but the real task is not over then .
the real task is to build a lasting peace .
let the old bridge at mostar become a symbol everywhere of that enduring challenge . " helle jeppesen -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne cathedral to be spared blight by skyscrapers unesco said friday it was likely to remove cologne cathedral from its list of world heritage in danger because a construction project that would have obscured views of the building looks set to be scaled down or shelved .

the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .

natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .
" the building of bridges between peoples and communities is never done , " matsuura said .
" we may physically restore a destroyed bridge but the real task is not over then .
the real task is to build a lasting peace .
let the old bridge at mostar become a symbol everywhere of that enduring challenge .

you might hear germans talk of going " shoppen " at their local " discounter , " enjoying a little " flirten " at a party for " singles , " or attending a " meeting " with the " management " at work . this mish-mash of deutsch and english is referred to by germans as " denglish , " and while many people think it 's cool , the small town of mühlhausen in thuringia think it ought to be verbote n . at the end of october , the town became a card-carrying member of the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- , a self-appointed watchdog intent on keeping german unsullied by outside influences . starti n g at home but before the city can declare itself cleansed of denglish , it has a lot of work to do , starting with the city 's official web site .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .
" the building of bridges between peoples and communities is never done , " matsuura said .
" we may physically restore a destroyed bridge but the real task is not over then .
the real task is to build a lasting peace .

still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said .

computer games enthusiasts could be among those doing the moaning . the coalition has grand plans for the future of germany 's youngsters , who they say should grow up in a society without violence .
that naturally means looking at ways of reducing child neglect and abuse , but the government wants to take its vision of harmony several steps further and has proposed the abolition of games which simulate brutal killings . games like " counterstrike " have in been on the hit list of titles to be removed from gaming shop shelves ever since a pupil at a school in the german town of erfurt ran amok , shooting 16 people before turning his weapon on himself . it 's a long , slow burning issue .
as with films , computer and video games are already certificated based on the age group to which they are suited , but that is not enough for the new lawmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kid 's stuff ?
andreas scheuer , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union , who is in charge of youth protection , told the online version of der spiegel magazine that violent killing games " have no place in germany 's bedrooms . " he said that parents should take responsibility for the games their children play , but that the government should do its bit to help less media-competent adults by introducing a " complete ban . " i n dustry oppositio n but with access to pretty much any software little more than a mouse-click away , it is hard to imagine exactly how such a ban should , or could be enforced .
and nobody is talking about that just now . understandably , the industry is opposed to the abolition of some of its best-sellers . olaf wolters , manager of the german interactive entertainment software association told spiegel that they wanted to work in close connection with the incoming government , adding that there was some unfortunate vocabulary in the coalition pact . " as far as we are concerned , there are no such things as killer games , but adult games , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german organizations take stock of tsunami relief an endeavor that needs time and money message at un disaster meeting : be prepared germany -pipe- 16.11.2005 german tsunami early warning system takes shape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : determining where to drop the buoys is n't easy almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia . amid the endless blue of the indian ocean and to the clicking of media cameras , german and indonesian scientists aboard the research vessel " sonne " -lrb- sun -rrb- , this week released the first of a host of bright yellow buoys off the coast of indonesia . " at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .
that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .
experts say the system is faster and more efficient , thus reducing the number of false alarms . " in seven or eight minutes we can process the data in order to be able to say with certainty whether a tsunami has erupted , " jörn lauterjung , head of the project told news agency dpa . " dangerous , seismological zone " one of the challenges facing scientists aboard the research vessel " sonne " is to determine where exactly the buoys should be released . accurate information about the makeup of the ocean bed is hard to get and over the past weeks , researchers have been trying to assess it onboard their ship , and feeding the findings to computer graphics program . the result has been graphic images of gigantic , jagged underwater mountain ranges with staggeringly different heights , spanning thousands of meters where the eurasian and indo australian plates meet and make up the notorious sunda straits . bildunterschrift : an image from the potsdam-based research center shows the sumatra quake that 's exactly where a massive build-up of energy is believed to have taken place , which first sparked an earthquake near the northern tip of sumatra , in turn triggering the tsunami last december . " the sunda straits is one of the most dangerous seismological zones of the world , " lauterjung said . that 's the reason the scientists have decided to concentrate on the region .
in particular , they plan to follow the course of the straits southwards where experts fear pent-up energy on overlapping plates still has n't been released - something , they say , could have deadly consequences . scientists plan to work up north to banda aceh after the sunda straits .
but the project is not expected to be completely finished and functioning until 2008 . it 's hoped that will provide enough time to train indonesian experts in the new system . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indonesia imports german tsunami warning model indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific .

" at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .
that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .
experts say the system is faster and more efficient , thus reducing the number of false alarms . " in seven or eight minutes we can process the data in order to be able to say with certainty whether a tsunami has erupted , " jörn lauterjung , head of the project told news agency dpa . " dangerous , seismological zone " one of the challenges facing scientists aboard the research vessel " sonne " is to determine where exactly the buoys should be released . accurate information about the makeup of the ocean bed is hard to get and over the past weeks , researchers have been trying to assess it onboard their ship , and feeding the findings to computer graphics program . the result has been graphic images of gigantic , jagged underwater mountain ranges with staggeringly different heights , spanning thousands of meters where the eurasian and indo australian plates meet and make up the notorious sunda straits . bildunterschrift : an image from the potsdam-based research center shows the sumatra quake that 's exactly where a massive build-up of energy is believed to have taken place , which first sparked an earthquake near the northern tip of sumatra , in turn triggering the tsunami last december . " the sunda straits is one of the most dangerous seismological zones of the world , " lauterjung said . that 's the reason the scientists have decided to concentrate on the region .
in particular , they plan to follow the course of the straits southwards where experts fear pent-up energy on overlapping plates still has n't been released - something , they say , could have deadly consequences . scientists plan to work up north to banda aceh after the sunda straits .
but the project is not expected to be completely finished and functioning until 2008 . it 's hoped that will provide enough time to train indonesian experts in the new system . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indonesia imports german tsunami warning model indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific .

" at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .
that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .

you might hear germans talk of going " shoppen " at their local " discounter , " enjoying a little " flirten " at a party for " singles , " or attending a " meeting " with the " management " at work . this mish-mash of deutsch and english is referred to by germans as " denglish , " and while many people think it 's cool , the small town of mühlhausen in thuringia think it ought to be verbote n . at the end of october , the town became a card-carrying member of the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- , a self-appointed watchdog intent on keeping german unsullied by outside influences . starti n g at home but before the city can declare itself cleansed of denglish , it has a lot of work to do , starting with the city 's official web site .
press spokeswoman angelika bergmann , whose job it is to maintain the site , admitted there is room for improvement .
the " home " button should be renamed " startseite , " for example .
bergmann is still looking for a good german alternative for the site 's " newsletter .

" " where there are german words for the english term , they should be used , " said bergmann , whose aim is to make communication simpler and more effective for the people of mühlhausen . to that end , denglish is n't the only linguistic element that is getting an overhaul - the brand of complicated bureaucratic german favored by civil servants will also be " translated " into german that the average person can understand . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish dw-world has compiled some stories on denglish .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german organizations take stock of tsunami relief an endeavor that needs time and money message at un disaster meeting : be prepared germany -pipe- 16.11.2005 german tsunami early warning system takes shape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : determining where to drop the buoys is n't easy almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia . amid the endless blue of the indian ocean and to the clicking of media cameras , german and indonesian scientists aboard the research vessel " sonne " -lrb- sun -rrb- , this week released the first of a host of bright yellow buoys off the coast of indonesia . " at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .
that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .
experts say the system is faster and more efficient , thus reducing the number of false alarms . " in seven or eight minutes we can process the data in order to be able to say with certainty whether a tsunami has erupted , " jörn lauterjung , head of the project told news agency dpa . " dangerous , seismological zone " one of the challenges facing scientists aboard the research vessel " sonne " is to determine where exactly the buoys should be released . accurate information about the makeup of the ocean bed is hard to get and over the past weeks , researchers have been trying to assess it onboard their ship , and feeding the findings to computer graphics program . the result has been graphic images of gigantic , jagged underwater mountain ranges with staggeringly different heights , spanning thousands of meters where the eurasian and indo australian plates meet and make up the notorious sunda straits . bildunterschrift : an image from the potsdam-based research center shows the sumatra quake that 's exactly where a massive build-up of energy is believed to have taken place , which first sparked an earthquake near the northern tip of sumatra , in turn triggering the tsunami last december . " the sunda straits is one of the most dangerous seismological zones of the world , " lauterjung said . that 's the reason the scientists have decided to concentrate on the region .
in particular , they plan to follow the course of the straits southwards where experts fear pent-up energy on overlapping plates still has n't been released - something , they say , could have deadly consequences . scientists plan to work up north to banda aceh after the sunda straits .
but the project is not expected to be completely finished and functioning until 2008 . it 's hoped that will provide enough time to train indonesian experts in the new system . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indonesia imports german tsunami warning model indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific .

" at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .
that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .
experts say the system is faster and more efficient , thus reducing the number of false alarms . " in seven or eight minutes we can process the data in order to be able to say with certainty whether a tsunami has erupted , " jörn lauterjung , head of the project told news agency dpa . " dangerous , seismological zone " one of the challenges facing scientists aboard the research vessel " sonne " is to determine where exactly the buoys should be released . accurate information about the makeup of the ocean bed is hard to get and over the past weeks , researchers have been trying to assess it onboard their ship , and feeding the findings to computer graphics program . the result has been graphic images of gigantic , jagged underwater mountain ranges with staggeringly different heights , spanning thousands of meters where the eurasian and indo australian plates meet and make up the notorious sunda straits . bildunterschrift : an image from the potsdam-based research center shows the sumatra quake that 's exactly where a massive build-up of energy is believed to have taken place , which first sparked an earthquake near the northern tip of sumatra , in turn triggering the tsunami last december . " the sunda straits is one of the most dangerous seismological zones of the world , " lauterjung said . that 's the reason the scientists have decided to concentrate on the region .
in particular , they plan to follow the course of the straits southwards where experts fear pent-up energy on overlapping plates still has n't been released - something , they say , could have deadly consequences . scientists plan to work up north to banda aceh after the sunda straits .
but the project is not expected to be completely finished and functioning until 2008 . it 's hoped that will provide enough time to train indonesian experts in the new system . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indonesia imports german tsunami warning model indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .
a privileged partnership is not described as a goal .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .
a privileged partnership is not described as a goal .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .
" the building of bridges between peoples and communities is never done , " matsuura said .
" we may physically restore a destroyed bridge but the real task is not over then .
the real task is to build a lasting peace .
let the old bridge at mostar become a symbol everywhere of that enduring challenge . " helle jeppesen -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne cathedral to be spared blight by skyscrapers unesco said friday it was likely to remove cologne cathedral from its list of world heritage in danger because a construction project that would have obscured views of the building looks set to be scaled down or shelved .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .
" the building of bridges between peoples and communities is never done , " matsuura said .
" we may physically restore a destroyed bridge but the real task is not over then .
the real task is to build a lasting peace .
let the old bridge at mostar become a symbol everywhere of that enduring challenge . " helle jeppesen -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne cathedral to be spared blight by skyscrapers unesco said friday it was likely to remove cologne cathedral from its list of world heritage in danger because a construction project that would have obscured views of the building looks set to be scaled down or shelved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2005 future foreign minister says germany to stay out of iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is promising steady continuity in future foreign policy germany 's incoming foreign minister steinmeier has ruled out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly on iraq .
but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .
a privileged partnership is not described as a goal .

" at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .
that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .
experts say the system is faster and more efficient , thus reducing the number of false alarms .

the " home " button should be renamed " startseite , " for example .
bergmann is still looking for a good german alternative for the site 's " newsletter .

" " where there are german words for the english term , they should be used , " said bergmann , whose aim is to make communication simpler and more effective for the people of mühlhausen . to that end , denglish is n't the only linguistic element that is getting an overhaul - the brand of complicated bureaucratic german favored by civil servants will also be " translated " into german that the average person can understand . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish dw-world has compiled some stories on denglish .

the deal cleared the way for the summit to focus on the digital divide between rich and poor nations . however , it left intact the united states ' single-handed control over the private body known as the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- that oversees the key technical and administrative roots of the internet . the eleventh-hour agreement sidestepped a brewing row between the us and the rest of the world , which officials warned could have seen the internet torn into competing or disconnected networks .
us control of the domain-name system that guides online traffic had become a sticking point for the european union as well as several countries such as iran and brazil , who argued that it should be managed by the united nations or some other global body . to mollify those bodies pushing for more international control , diplomats agreed to set up multilateral talks , including an open-ended process " towards enhanced cooperation -lrb- by -rrb- relevant international organizations " on oversight and public policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , speaks during the summit 's opening session the new process will be triggered by un secretary general kofi annan in the first quarter of 2006 , according to the final draft , but it set no target for an outcome . the eu said in a statement that the agreement would lead to " further internationalization of internet governance , and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end . " " unique role of the us " us diplomats said the agreement essentially endorses the status quo . the accord " preserved the unique role of the us government in ensuring the reliability and stability of the internet , " top us negotiator david gross said wednesday . " it took no action with regard to existing institutions including icann .
it created no new international organizations , " added gross , the us coordinator for international communications and information policy . the deal also foresees the creation of an internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- for an initial five-year term to hold talks on all internet issues , including problems such as spam , cyber crime and computer viruses . the igf , which greece has offered to host , will also be allowed to " build on the existing structures of internet governance " but has no concrete powers . un under secretary general for communications shashi tharoor said an agreement on internet governance was " crucial " to continue to build on freedom of expression on the global process .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2005 future foreign minister says germany to stay out of iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is promising steady continuity in future foreign policy germany 's incoming foreign minister steinmeier has ruled out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly on iraq .
but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .
a privileged partnership is not described as a goal .

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes .

computer games enthusiasts could be among those doing the moaning . the coalition has grand plans for the future of germany 's youngsters , who they say should grow up in a society without violence .
that naturally means looking at ways of reducing child neglect and abuse , but the government wants to take its vision of harmony several steps further and has proposed the abolition of games which simulate brutal killings . games like " counterstrike " have in been on the hit list of titles to be removed from gaming shop shelves ever since a pupil at a school in the german town of erfurt ran amok , shooting 16 people before turning his weapon on himself . it 's a long , slow burning issue .
as with films , computer and video games are already certificated based on the age group to which they are suited , but that is not enough for the new lawmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kid 's stuff ?
andreas scheuer , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union , who is in charge of youth protection , told the online version of der spiegel magazine that violent killing games " have no place in germany 's bedrooms . " he said that parents should take responsibility for the games their children play , but that the government should do its bit to help less media-competent adults by introducing a " complete ban . " i n dustry oppositio n but with access to pretty much any software little more than a mouse-click away , it is hard to imagine exactly how such a ban should , or could be enforced .
and nobody is talking about that just now . understandably , the industry is opposed to the abolition of some of its best-sellers . olaf wolters , manager of the german interactive entertainment software association told spiegel that they wanted to work in close connection with the incoming government , adding that there was some unfortunate vocabulary in the coalition pact . " as far as we are concerned , there are no such things as killer games , but adult games , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

" at 4:30 pm , under sunny skies and ideal weather conditions , one of the two gitews -lsb- german-indonesian tsunami early warning system -rsb- buoys was released at the entrance to the sunda strait , " wrote ernst flüh , a geophysicist who works at the leibniz institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel and who is one of the scientists aboard the research vessel , in a web log for deutsche welle . part of a german-financed flagship tsunami early warning system , the high-tech project which cost some 45 million euros -lrb- $ 52 million -rrb- is headed by the potsdam-based geo research center along with half a dozen other german research institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tsunami wrought horrific devastation the buoy released as a test project on tuesday is meant to find a final anchoring place this week and will be followed by a second one by the end of the month - in time for the first anniversary of the tsunami catastrophe on dec 26 last year , which killed some 220,000 people around the indian ocean . fast and efficient the high-tech yellow buoys , which weigh about three tons each and cost 300,000 euros apiece , are designed to avert the large-scale disaster wreaked by last year 's tsunami by alarming thousands of people of imminent killer waves in future . that would be achieved through interplay between about 10 of the special gps buoys , pressure sensors embedded on the ocean floor and measuring devices for earthquakes and water levels on land .
that information would in turn be fed to observation stations on the coast , which could then gauge the danger level . the system is believed to be superior to the existing us model in the pacific , as it is able to identify more accurately the tsunami waves that are often triggered by earthquakes .
experts say the system is faster and more efficient , thus reducing the number of false alarms . " in seven or eight minutes we can process the data in order to be able to say with certainty whether a tsunami has erupted , " jörn lauterjung , head of the project told news agency dpa . " dangerous , seismological zone " one of the challenges facing scientists aboard the research vessel " sonne " is to determine where exactly the buoys should be released . accurate information about the makeup of the ocean bed is hard to get and over the past weeks , researchers have been trying to assess it onboard their ship , and feeding the findings to computer graphics program . the result has been graphic images of gigantic , jagged underwater mountain ranges with staggeringly different heights , spanning thousands of meters where the eurasian and indo australian plates meet and make up the notorious sunda straits . bildunterschrift : an image from the potsdam-based research center shows the sumatra quake that 's exactly where a massive build-up of energy is believed to have taken place , which first sparked an earthquake near the northern tip of sumatra , in turn triggering the tsunami last december . " the sunda straits is one of the most dangerous seismological zones of the world , " lauterjung said . that 's the reason the scientists have decided to concentrate on the region .
in particular , they plan to follow the course of the straits southwards where experts fear pent-up energy on overlapping plates still has n't been released - something , they say , could have deadly consequences . scientists plan to work up north to banda aceh after the sunda straits .
but the project is not expected to be completely finished and functioning until 2008 . it 's hoped that will provide enough time to train indonesian experts in the new system . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indonesia imports german tsunami warning model indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific .

the deal cleared the way for the summit to focus on the digital divide between rich and poor nations . however , it left intact the united states ' single-handed control over the private body known as the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- that oversees the key technical and administrative roots of the internet . the eleventh-hour agreement sidestepped a brewing row between the us and the rest of the world , which officials warned could have seen the internet torn into competing or disconnected networks .
us control of the domain-name system that guides online traffic had become a sticking point for the european union as well as several countries such as iran and brazil , who argued that it should be managed by the united nations or some other global body . to mollify those bodies pushing for more international control , diplomats agreed to set up multilateral talks , including an open-ended process " towards enhanced cooperation -lrb- by -rrb- relevant international organizations " on oversight and public policy issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan , speaks during the summit 's opening session the new process will be triggered by un secretary general kofi annan in the first quarter of 2006 , according to the final draft , but it set no target for an outcome . the eu said in a statement that the agreement would lead to " further internationalization of internet governance , and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end . " " unique role of the us " us diplomats said the agreement essentially endorses the status quo . the accord " preserved the unique role of the us government in ensuring the reliability and stability of the internet , " top us negotiator david gross said wednesday . " it took no action with regard to existing institutions including icann .
it created no new international organizations , " added gross , the us coordinator for international communications and information policy . the deal also foresees the creation of an internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- for an initial five-year term to hold talks on all internet issues , including problems such as spam , cyber crime and computer viruses . the igf , which greece has offered to host , will also be allowed to " build on the existing structures of internet governance " but has no concrete powers . un under secretary general for communications shashi tharoor said an agreement on internet governance was " crucial " to continue to build on freedom of expression on the global process .

" i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership .

but he 's said better relations with poland will be a top priority . frank-walter steinmeier , who will join a power-sharing government under conservative leader angela merkel due to take office this month , said on wednesday that there would be no major change of course in germany 's policy towards iraq . " i believe there wo n't be any fundamental change , " steinmeier said in an interview with public television broadcaster ard , adding that he did n't have the impression that washington would make demands on the future german government such as sending german soldiers to iraq . the 49-year-old steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , said that the bush administration was savvy enough to realize that germany was already fulfilling its responsibility towards rebuilding iraq by contributing to training iraqi security forces . earlier this week , the us was reported to have requested germany to expand its activities in iraq .
but , a representative of the us state department in berlin stressed that it did n't include sending german soldiers to iraq . schröder 's government vehemently refused to participate in the us-led war in iraq two and a half years ago , sparking unprecedented tensions and sending transatlantic relations plummeting to an all-time low . on wednesday , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us , which have eased considerably in recent months .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship and european integration would be the two pillars of german foreign policy . emphasis on poland as far as the latter goes , steinmeier has indicated that poland will be top priority .
steinmeier told the in-house newspaper of his social democratic party , vorwärts this week that he had phoned his designated polish counterpart stefan meller immediately after the latter was appointed . " we agreed that there have been tensions on both sides , " he said .
" the problems have not been resolved but we intend to do that soon .
that is why one of my first trips will be to warsaw . " relations between berlin and warsaw have been strained over plans by a german group to build a center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from poland after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of their country . there has also been friction over demands for the polish government to restore property to german families who were driven out during the war . warsaw is also displeased with russo-german plans to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states which would miss out on lucrative deals . steady continuity with key allies steinmeier has also promised continuity in relations with all key allies . " the foundations of our foreign policy will remain : close partnership with france , reconciling with our eastern neighbors - above all with poland - and deepening the transatlantic friendship . " he acknowledged that the conservatives had criticized outgoing chancellor schröder 's friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin during the campaign for the september election , but said it would have no impact on future policy . " there is nothing in the coalition agreement -lrb- with the conservatives -rrb- about that criticism , " he said . " to the contrary , the idea of a strategic partnership -lrb- with russia -rrb- is explicitly mentioned in the agreement . " on turkey , steinmeier said he was pleased the conservatives had been unable to force through their " gruff rejection " of ankara 's eu bid or the mention of a " privileged partnership " that would stop short of full eu membership . " the coalition partners commit themselves -lrb- in the pact -rrb- to open-ended accession negotiations with turkey with the goal of eu membership .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .
" the building of bridges between peoples and communities is never done , " matsuura said .
" we may physically restore a destroyed bridge but the real task is not over then .
the real task is to build a lasting peace .
let the old bridge at mostar become a symbol everywhere of that enduring challenge . " helle jeppesen -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne cathedral to be spared blight by skyscrapers unesco said friday it was likely to remove cologne cathedral from its list of world heritage in danger because a construction project that would have obscured views of the building looks set to be scaled down or shelved .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .

that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .
" the building of bridges between peoples and communities is never done , " matsuura said .
" we may physically restore a destroyed bridge but the real task is not over then .
the real task is to build a lasting peace .
let the old bridge at mostar become a symbol everywhere of that enduring challenge . " helle jeppesen -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne cathedral to be spared blight by skyscrapers unesco said friday it was likely to remove cologne cathedral from its list of world heritage in danger because a construction project that would have obscured views of the building looks set to be scaled down or shelved .

computer games enthusiasts could be among those doing the moaning . the coalition has grand plans for the future of germany 's youngsters , who they say should grow up in a society without violence .
that naturally means looking at ways of reducing child neglect and abuse , but the government wants to take its vision of harmony several steps further and has proposed the abolition of games which simulate brutal killings . games like " counterstrike " have in been on the hit list of titles to be removed from gaming shop shelves ever since a pupil at a school in the german town of erfurt ran amok , shooting 16 people before turning his weapon on himself . it 's a long , slow burning issue .
as with films , computer and video games are already certificated based on the age group to which they are suited , but that is not enough for the new lawmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kid 's stuff ?
andreas scheuer , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union , who is in charge of youth protection , told the online version of der spiegel magazine that violent killing games " have no place in germany 's bedrooms . " he said that parents should take responsibility for the games their children play , but that the government should do its bit to help less media-competent adults by introducing a " complete ban . " i n dustry oppositio n but with access to pretty much any software little more than a mouse-click away , it is hard to imagine exactly how such a ban should , or could be enforced .
and nobody is talking about that just now . understandably , the industry is opposed to the abolition of some of its best-sellers . olaf wolters , manager of the german interactive entertainment software association told spiegel that they wanted to work in close connection with the incoming government , adding that there was some unfortunate vocabulary in the coalition pact . " as far as we are concerned , there are no such things as killer games , but adult games , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

16 , 1945 , the un educational , scientific and cultural organization was founded to employ culture as a weapon against future wars . wars are underway and human dignity is threatened by poverty , underdevelopment , terror and slavery in many places , as german president horst köhler stressed at the unesco general assembly to celebrate the organization 's 60th anniversary in paris .
still , the way people think has changed , köhler said . " we have worldwide organizations such as unesco that stand for the protection of human dignity and that strengthen the foundations for the co-existence of different cultures , " köhler said . " and we have a global public that takes an interest in the fates of individuals and cultures that suffer from violence , wrongs , intolerance and poverty . " cultural values are the foundation for unesco 's work .
" since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed , " the preamble of its constitution reads .
the organization has a history of initiating global literacy campaigns that dates back to 1948 .
then , it demanded that its member states introduce mandatory primary school attendance for all children .
now , the organization is in the midst of its decade-long campaign , " education for all , " which , since 2003 , has aimed to increase literacy worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys and girls should have equal access to education in 2000 , unesco 's member states set eight education objectives they intended to realize worldwide by 2015 .
they included providing access to free and good-quality primary schooling for all boys and girls , reducing the ranks of the illiterate by half and ensuring that men and women would enjoy equal rights to education .
targeting illiteracy a unesco monitoring report on global education levels published in london last week showed that , in many countries , primary school education is the main sticking point and that immense efforts are necessary to lower the number of illiterate adults .
but the problem of illiteracy ca n't be ignored until the primary school initiatives start bearing fruit , said nicholas burnett , director of the monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has managed to increase literacy vastly " this approach is problematic , because it ignores the 771 million adults in the world who can not read or write .
that 's one-fifth of the world 's adult population , " burnett said .
" implicitly that says we do n't care about one-fifth of the world 's adult population , so that is , to us , an unacceptable approach . " but burnett said there had been progress , too .
china is one of the success stories .
the number of illiterate people there dropped by almost 100 million in recent years . building bridges between peoples among the public , however , unesco 's best-known institution is the list of world heritage sites .
when the organization threatened to take cologne 's cathedral off the list because property developers were planning to erect skyscrapers that would have obscured views of the building , germans were appalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne cathedral " if the cathedral is struck from the world heritage list - which i personally can hardly imagine - it will be a big disgrace for the city of cologne , but also for germany , " said the city 's director of development and planning , bernd streitberger . buildings such as the cologne cathedral or india 's taj mahal are n't the only sort of sites on the list of more than 700 locations .
natural phenomena , such as the great barrier reef , are also protected as world heritage sites . the old bridge of mostar in bosnia-herzogovina had already been put on the list when it was destroyed during the 1992-1995 bosnian war .
it was rebuilt and reopened in 2004 in a ceremony presided over by unesco general-director koichiro matsuura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old bridge at mostar matsuura described the bridge as a symbol for bridges built between people , unesco 's real job .
" the building of bridges between peoples and communities is never done , " matsuura said .
" we may physically restore a destroyed bridge but the real task is not over then .
the real task is to build a lasting peace .
let the old bridge at mostar become a symbol everywhere of that enduring challenge . " helle jeppesen -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne cathedral to be spared blight by skyscrapers unesco said friday it was likely to remove cologne cathedral from its list of world heritage in danger because a construction project that would have obscured views of the building looks set to be scaled down or shelved .

only the menu and the slight accent to the singing suggest that this is not a pub somewhere in the heart of england .
this is düsseldorf , the crowd is predominantly german and everyone is pumped by the fact that oasis is in town . shouting over another refrain , a number of the assembled choir of would-be vocalists try and explain what it is about the band that the germans love . " liam gallagher .
all anyone could want in life , " said one girl . " shoes , haircuts and guitars , " said her male companion . but what is it really about oasis , a band brimming with traditional working class machismo and the potential for violence and mayhem made famous by the likes of the who and led zeppelin , which appeals to the germans ? thomas venker , editor-in-chief at german music monthly magazine intro said he thinks it 's just that volatility that attracts german fans . " markus kavka -lrb- mtv germany presenter -rrb- once said that , for him , oasis made him feel like it was okay to be both a man and an indie boy , " venker said .
" it was okay to listen to those student sounds and also drink beer and talk about football .
oasis brought that attitude to germany and many people tuned into that . " breaki n g the pop mo n oto n y " oasis brought us serious music about human emotions , " said one fan queuing for the band 's phillipshalle gig .
" they crashed the bravo hits party and trampled on all that commercial and fake rubbish germans had been fed by music channels for so long . " bildunterschrift : germany is a regular stop on the oasis european tour schedule . oasis is just one of many british bands that continue to enjoy commercial and critical success in germany despite the emergence of a strong german music scene over the last two years . but a tradition of well-received musical acts from the uk actually stretches back decades . " a lot of british bands in the sixties had big followings in germany , " andy bell , bass player with oasis , told dw-world .
" some were massive in germany way before they were popular back home .
many even released stuff on german labels that did n't come out in england . " beatlema n ia bega n i n germa n y " the popularity of british bands in germany has a lot to do with the beatles , i think , " said gem archer , the band 's rhythm guitarist .
" everyone back in britain thought they were german . " the legacy of the beatles ' time in germany and the affection the germans continue to have for the fab four can still be seen in the list of records the band still holds in the german charts including most number one singles and most number one albums . but surely a merseybeat four-piece with a talent for catchy pop songs can not be solely credited for breaching cultural barriers and instilling a love of music from a country with such a different mentality and identity from that of the germans . heal wartime scars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german music fans continue to embrace british music .
" after the war , germans were looking for a new start , " said cultural theorist eckhard schumacher from the university of munich .
" for german youth , music from britain was foreign and new ; something very different from the culture of their parents ' past which everyone wanted to move on from .
it was also a way to connect with another country 's youth and undermine the idea of being enemies … and popular music has always been about connecting people . " popular culture author anne schönberg said the connection formed in the immediate post-war years is still strong .
" much is made of the differences between the british and the germans but very little is said of their similarities .

about 10,000 participants are at expected at the three-day world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- .
the event is being eclipsed by a row over how the net is run and fears over freedom of expression in tunisia .
many developing nations say it is time control moved from the incumbent us body to a more accountable global one .
a un-sponsored group has spent the last two years working on various proposals , without reaching agreement .
last minute negotiations have been under way in tunis , aimed at settling differences between the us and countries seeking a change .
the eu has been mediating between the americans and a group of countries including china and iran , which have been pushing for international control .
" we 're two-thirds of our way to a good compromise , " said eu spokesman martin selmayr .
spreading the net the tunis summit is also a chance to see how far governments have gone in their pledges for an " inclusive information society " set out two years ago at a first summit in geneva .
a declaration of principles and plan of action came out of geneva as an attempt to encourage governments and stakeholders to close digital divides while tackling un millennium development goals , including the pledge to make the net accessible to all by 2015 .
we have glimpsed only the beginning of the benefits it -lsb- the net -rsb- can provide kofi annan , un secretary general why the us role has to change but worldwide only 14 % of the population is online , compared to 62 % in the us .
the geneva summit disappointed many countries after the rich nations failed to back a digital solidarity fund .
the fund , intended to help finance technology projects in developing countries , was formally launched earlier this year .
the voluntary fund has so far only raised $ 6.4m -lrb- £ 3.68m -rrb- in cash and pledges , so the un will be hoping to encourage more contributions .
one effort which will receive much attention is the non-profit one laptop per child group , set up by nicholas negroponte , chairman and founder of the massachusetts institute of technology media labs .
it plans to produce up to 15 million sub- $ 100 laptops within a year .
professor negroponte will unveil the prototype at the summit .
there will be hundreds of other projects , events , roundtables , high-level talks and exhibitions at the summit too .
life-saving potential there are other larger social justice issues to be tackled , such as how to ensure freedom of expression and information for everyone on the net , an issue which bloggers will be watching closely .
in a piece in the washington post earlier this month , un secretary general kofi annan said the net had become an agent of revolutionary change in health , education , journalism and politics .
" we have glimpsed only the beginning of the benefits it can provide : for victims of disaster , quicker , better-coordinated relief ; for poor people in remote areas , lifesaving medical information ; and , for people trapped under repressive governments , access to uncensored information as well as an outlet to air their grievances and appeal for help . "
ideas like the sub- $ 100 laptop for all will be showcased many fear real interrogation of these issues will be sidelined by political pressure and arguments over net governance , which many believe will result in no firm resolution .
already , non-governmental organisations -lrb- ngos -rrb- are questioning the wisdom of holding the summit in tunisia , a country which has a tight rein on the media .
although freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed by the tunisian constitution , the government closely controls the press and broadcasting .
net monitoring is omnipresent there , and websites containing content which is critical of the government are frequently blocked .
some ngos have found it difficult to get accreditation for wsis .
a separate summit , called the citizen 's summit on the information society , is taking place at the same time for many groups who can not attend wsis .
it is organised by ngos , with support from 80 groups , and some 400-500 participants are expected .
but it suffered a setback this week when it was informed its pre-arranged venue was unavailable at short notice .
tight grip the key debate on net governance centres around whether governments should have more of a role in net governance .
many outside the us argue that no one country should have authority over something that now plays such a key role in the global economy .
security has been stepped up in tunisia there are fears , however , that giving control over to a more representative un body would mean national governments would have greater leeway in imposing restrictions on its use .
the un has been wrangling over who should run the internet for some time and the issue divided nations at the wsis first stage in geneva two years ago .
the net 's infrastructure has been managed in an informal way through collaboration with businesses , civil society , academic and technical communities .
many developing countries have felt left out of this process .
a private , not-for-profit group , formed by the us department of commerce , called the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , currently supervises the net 's infrastructure .
it oversees domain name and addressing systems , such as country domain suffixes , and manages how net browsers and e-mail programs direct traffic .
developing nations want the net and its domains shared more equally , so that everyone can benefit from the web 's economic , political , social and cultural advantages .
the us is reluctant to relinquish its grip , arguing that un proposals would shift regulation from private sector leadership , to government , top-down control .

about 10,000 participants are at expected at the three-day world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- .
the event is being eclipsed by a row over how the net is run and fears over freedom of expression in tunisia .
many developing nations say it is time control moved from the incumbent us body to a more accountable global one .
a un-sponsored group has spent the last two years working on various proposals , without reaching agreement .
last minute negotiations have been under way in tunis , aimed at settling differences between the us and countries seeking a change .
the eu has been mediating between the americans and a group of countries including china and iran , which have been pushing for international control .
" we 're two-thirds of our way to a good compromise , " said eu spokesman martin selmayr .
spreading the net the tunis summit is also a chance to see how far governments have gone in their pledges for an " inclusive information society " set out two years ago at a first summit in geneva .
a declaration of principles and plan of action came out of geneva as an attempt to encourage governments and stakeholders to close digital divides while tackling un millennium development goals , including the pledge to make the net accessible to all by 2015 .
we have glimpsed only the beginning of the benefits it -lsb- the net -rsb- can provide kofi annan , un secretary general why the us role has to change but worldwide only 14 % of the population is online , compared to 62 % in the us .
the geneva summit disappointed many countries after the rich nations failed to back a digital solidarity fund .
the fund , intended to help finance technology projects in developing countries , was formally launched earlier this year .
the voluntary fund has so far only raised $ 6.4m -lrb- £ 3.68m -rrb- in cash and pledges , so the un will be hoping to encourage more contributions .
one effort which will receive much attention is the non-profit one laptop per child group , set up by nicholas negroponte , chairman and founder of the massachusetts institute of technology media labs .
it plans to produce up to 15 million sub- $ 100 laptops within a year .
professor negroponte will unveil the prototype at the summit .
there will be hundreds of other projects , events , roundtables , high-level talks and exhibitions at the summit too .
life-saving potential there are other larger social justice issues to be tackled , such as how to ensure freedom of expression and information for everyone on the net , an issue which bloggers will be watching closely .
in a piece in the washington post earlier this month , un secretary general kofi annan said the net had become an agent of revolutionary change in health , education , journalism and politics .
" we have glimpsed only the beginning of the benefits it can provide : for victims of disaster , quicker , better-coordinated relief ; for poor people in remote areas , lifesaving medical information ; and , for people trapped under repressive governments , access to uncensored information as well as an outlet to air their grievances and appeal for help . "
ideas like the sub- $ 100 laptop for all will be showcased many fear real interrogation of these issues will be sidelined by political pressure and arguments over net governance , which many believe will result in no firm resolution .
already , non-governmental organisations -lrb- ngos -rrb- are questioning the wisdom of holding the summit in tunisia , a country which has a tight rein on the media .
although freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed by the tunisian constitution , the government closely controls the press and broadcasting .
net monitoring is omnipresent there , and websites containing content which is critical of the government are frequently blocked .
some ngos have found it difficult to get accreditation for wsis .
a separate summit , called the citizen 's summit on the information society , is taking place at the same time for many groups who can not attend wsis .
it is organised by ngos , with support from 80 groups , and some 400-500 participants are expected .
but it suffered a setback this week when it was informed its pre-arranged venue was unavailable at short notice .
tight grip the key debate on net governance centres around whether governments should have more of a role in net governance .
many outside the us argue that no one country should have authority over something that now plays such a key role in the global economy .
security has been stepped up in tunisia there are fears , however , that giving control over to a more representative un body would mean national governments would have greater leeway in imposing restrictions on its use .
the un has been wrangling over who should run the internet for some time and the issue divided nations at the wsis first stage in geneva two years ago .
the net 's infrastructure has been managed in an informal way through collaboration with businesses , civil society , academic and technical communities .
many developing countries have felt left out of this process .
a private , not-for-profit group , formed by the us department of commerce , called the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , currently supervises the net 's infrastructure .
it oversees domain name and addressing systems , such as country domain suffixes , and manages how net browsers and e-mail programs direct traffic .
developing nations want the net and its domains shared more equally , so that everyone can benefit from the web 's economic , political , social and cultural advantages .
the us is reluctant to relinquish its grip , arguing that un proposals would shift regulation from private sector leadership , to government , top-down control .

about 10,000 participants are at expected at the three-day world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- .
the event is being eclipsed by a row over how the net is run and fears over freedom of expression in tunisia .
many developing nations say it is time control moved from the incumbent us body to a more accountable global one .
a un-sponsored group has spent the last two years working on various proposals , without reaching agreement .
last minute negotiations have been under way in tunis , aimed at settling differences between the us and countries seeking a change .
the eu has been mediating between the americans and a group of countries including china and iran , which have been pushing for international control .
" we 're two-thirds of our way to a good compromise , " said eu spokesman martin selmayr .
spreading the net the tunis summit is also a chance to see how far governments have gone in their pledges for an " inclusive information society " set out two years ago at a first summit in geneva .
a declaration of principles and plan of action came out of geneva as an attempt to encourage governments and stakeholders to close digital divides while tackling un millennium development goals , including the pledge to make the net accessible to all by 2015 . "
we have glimpsed only the beginning of the benefits it -lsb- the net -rsb- can provide " kofi annan , un secretary general why the us role has to change but worldwide only 14 % of the population is online , compared to 62 % in the us .
the geneva summit disappointed many countries after the rich nations failed to back a digital solidarity fund .
the fund , intended to help finance technology projects in developing countries , was formally launched earlier this year .
the voluntary fund has so far only raised $ 6.4m -lrb- £ 3.68m -rrb- in cash and pledges , so the un will be hoping to encourage more contributions .
one effort which will receive much attention is the non-profit one laptop per child group , set up by nicholas negroponte , chairman and founder of the massachusetts institute of technology media labs .
it plans to produce up to 15 million sub- $ 100 laptops within a year .
professor negroponte will unveil the prototype at the summit .
there will be hundreds of other projects , events , roundtables , high-level talks and exhibitions at the summit too .
life-saving potential there are other larger social justice issues to be tackled , such as how to ensure freedom of expression and information for everyone on the net , an issue which bloggers will be watching closely .
in a piece in the washington post earlier this month , un secretary general kofi annan said the net had become an agent of revolutionary change in health , education , journalism and politics .
" we have glimpsed only the beginning of the benefits it can provide : for victims of disaster , quicker , better-coordinated relief ; for poor people in remote areas , lifesaving medical information ; and , for people trapped under repressive governments , access to uncensored information as well as an outlet to air their grievances and appeal for help . "
many fear real interrogation of these issues will be sidelined by political pressure and arguments over net governance , which many believe will result in no firm resolution .
already , non-governmental organisations -lrb- ngos -rrb- are questioning the wisdom of holding the summit in tunisia , a country which has a tight rein on the media .
although freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed by the tunisian constitution , the government closely controls the press and broadcasting .
net monitoring is omnipresent there , and websites containing content which is critical of the government are frequently blocked .
some ngos have found it difficult to get accreditation for wsis .
a separate summit , called the citizen 's summit on the information society , is taking place at the same time for many groups who can not attend wsis .
it is organised by ngos , with support from 80 groups , and some 400-500 participants are expected .
but it suffered a setback this week when it was informed its pre-arranged venue was unavailable at short notice .

he said police work was being hampered by the lack of a proper examination of what they were for - whether it was to fight crime or fight its causes , to build stronger communities or enforce zero tolerance .

ben fogle talked to our sports presenter chris hollins he explained the rather bizarre fact that both he and james will be naked for the crossing !
that 's because if they had clothes on , they would become soaked in sea water and begin irritating their skin .
luckily , the weather will be warm enough for them not to be clothed .
you 'll be able to keep up with ben and james 's progress from the race website .
ben and james set off across the atlantic from the canary islands on 27 november - they 'll row non-stop aiming for the west indies - more than 2,500 nautical miles away .

previous competitors have been known to take four months to make the crossing .

as well as spending a year learning to be self sufficient on an island for castaway ; ben has also taken part in a celebrity boxing match against former eastender 's star sid owen - ben won .
he has also completed the 150 mile sand marathon in the intense heat of the sahara , but ben and james will complete their atlantic naked - apparently to prevent abrasions from the salt water .

the welsh consumer council wants to see lessons like maths and information technology -lrb- it -rrb- used to show how a household budget must be balanced .
it claims up to a quarter of adults in wales feel scared or confused when dealing with financial institutions .
the welsh assembly government said teaching financial awareness was part of the basic curriculum in wales .
the consumer council report claims a significant proportion of adults lack adequate understanding of financial issues , with a fifth admitting they had committed to a financial product without understanding all the terms and conditions .
a survey found 14 % of adults in wales did not have a current or basic bank account , compared with 11 % across the uk .
it also discovered that fewer than half are putting money into a savings account on a regular basis . "
these days you are inundated with offers through the post .
it 's far too easy to get credit " credit union manager , barry roberts vivienne sugar , the council 's chair , said : " almost nine out of 10 people rely on informal information sources to learn about money issues .
" however , more than eight out of 10 would feel more confident if they had learnt how to manage money at school . "
report author lindsey kearton said everyday situations such as running a mobile phone could be used to show young people the value of understanding finance .
' using credit " a lot of young people have mobile phones .
in the future , they are going to have to take the responsibility for paying that bill .
" by building financial awareness into the curriculum , using existing subject areas , it creates an opportunity to bring in money-related issues , like careers , their first pay packet and looking at all your outgoings .
" young people are more accepting of the fact they are using credit .
while that is not a bad thing in itself , unless you keep some kind of control , that can lead to dangerous situation where you are building up a large amount of debt . "
barry roberts , a manager at llandudno and district credit union , said many of its 2,000 members would feel intimidated by financial institutions .
he said : " these days you are inundated with offers through the post .
it 's far too easy to get credit .
' saving first ' " the place to start is the school curriculum .
there has to be some sort of financial education , and trying to get over the philosophy of saving first and paying for something later . "
the assembly government said financial awareness was part of pupils ' personal social education -lrb- pse -rrb- programme at school .
a spokesman said : " one aspect of pse includes specific learning outcomes on financial awareness for pupils of all ages - for example , key stage 4 pupils should understand a range of economic and industrial issues related to their role as consumers and future providers and their responsibilities in personal finance . "
he said the assembly government was also looking at how it might develop this area further .

the theatr powys building in llandrindod wells has lain empty since the blaze in september 2000 .
it forced the company to relocate to a nearby industrial unit .
but thanks to a £ 647,000 grant from the arts council of wales , the building work worth nearly £ 1m should be completed by the end of next summer .
valued at more than £ 972,000 , parts of theatr powys ' base will either be rebuilt or refurbished .
as well as the grant , money for the project has come from an insurance payout over the fire .
the building work will include a new rehearsal studio .

theatr powys ' artistic director ian yeoman said : " a substantial part of the roofing will have to be replaced .
" the fabric of the building was damaged and we lost an enormous amount of archive material , technical references and costumes through smoke and water damage .
" it was an extraordinary inconvenience , but we kept going and now we 're looking forward to moving back in . "
work has begun to restore the building an electrical fault is believed to have caused the fire at the former school in tremont road five years ago .
powys councillor louis williams , board member for the arts , said : " theatr powys not only provides a key educational programme but also a vital service to the community by touring schools , village halls , arts centres and theatres across the county . "
dr kath davies of the arts council for wales described theatr powys as " one of the foremost theatre in education companies in wales " .
she added : " the refurbished building will offer state-of-the-art rehearsal and workshop facilities for the company and for young people in powys . "

sir richard branson , a key supporter of toll 's bid , also criticised the payment .
patrick denied their accusations .

victoria daniels told westminster coroner 's court she heard five shots as michal pech shot ex-girlfriend clare bernal , then turned the gun on himself .
a verdict of suicide was recorded for pech , who was due to be sentenced for harassing ms bernal , 22 .
the coroner adjourned the inquest so evidence can be gathered to see if the judicial system failed ms bernal .
the court heard when ms bernal ended their relationship , security guard pech began following her , telling her he loved her , then positioning himself in the store so he could see her in a mirror .
guilty of harassment pech , who had threatened to kill ms bernal in march , had been on bail on condition he did not contact her or go to dulwich village , south-east london , where she lived .
he had been due to be sentenced on 21 september after pleading guilty to harassment .
ms bernal , originally from tunbridge wells , kent , was killed on 14 september .
joshua dubin , representing ms bernal , applied for scope of the inquest to be broadened so the coroner could look into alleged failings in the law enforcement systems , rather than just establishing how she died .
mr dubin said : " there is arguably a system failure here that has led to the death of this deceased and it gives rise to concerns about deaths or potential future deaths of others . "
system failure but a row broke out in the coroner 's court between ms bernal 's divorced parents - her father accused his ex-wife of not taking the complaints about pech seriously .
mrs bernal wept as she said she had believed police were in control of the situation adding : " that is my mistake , and i have to live with that . "
earlier , miss daniels told the court said she saw pech , who had taken cocaine , sliding around the beauty counter where ms bernal worked .
" i thought he might have been a boyfriend surprising her or a stupid customer who wanted to ask her a question , " she said .
" at that point , clare was looking in my direction and i smiled at her because it was time to go home and then he pulled a gun out . "
she told the hearing she grabbed a colleague and ran outside . "
i sincerely hope that a wider inquiry will help prevent this from happening to another woman " clare bernal 's mother patricia " there was one big bang and then i heard about three more - there must have been four or five shots . "
pathologist dr vesna djurovic said ms bernal was shot four times - once in the back of the head and three times in the face .
adjourning the case to 19 january , dr knapman said : " it may be that i will make a decision -lsb- on widening the scope of the inquest -rsb- . "
in a statement after the hearing , ms bernal 's mother patricia said : " i was very close to my daughter and miss her terribly .
" i , like clare , put my faith in the criminal justice system .
i sincerely hope that a wider inquiry will help prevent this from happening to another woman . "

victoria daniels told westminster coroner 's court she heard five shots as michal pech shot ex-girlfriend clare bernal , then turned the gun on himself .
a verdict of suicide was recorded for pech , who was due to be sentenced for harassing ms bernal , 22 .
the coroner adjourned the inquest so evidence can be gathered to see if the judicial system failed ms bernal .
the court heard when ms bernal ended their relationship , security guard pech began following her , telling her he loved her , then positioning himself in the store so he could see her in a mirror .
guilty of harassment pech , who had threatened to kill ms bernal in march , had been on bail on condition he did not contact her or go to dulwich village , south-east london , where she lived .
he had been due to be sentenced on 21 september after pleading guilty to harassment .
ms bernal , originally from tunbridge wells , kent , was killed on 14 september .
joshua dubin , representing ms bernal , applied for scope of the inquest to be broadened so the coroner could look into alleged failings in the law enforcement systems , rather than just establishing how she died .
mr dubin said : " there is arguably a system failure here that has led to the death of this deceased and it gives rise to concerns about deaths or potential future deaths of others . "
system failure but a row broke out in the coroner 's court between ms bernal 's divorced parents - her father accused his ex-wife of not taking the complaints about pech seriously .
mrs bernal wept as she said she had believed police were in control of the situation adding : " that is my mistake , and i have to live with that . "
earlier , miss daniels told the court said she saw pech , who had taken cocaine , sliding around the beauty counter where ms bernal worked .
" i thought he might have been a boyfriend surprising her or a stupid customer who wanted to ask her a question , " she said .
" at that point , clare was looking in my direction and i smiled at her because it was time to go home and then he pulled a gun out . "
she told the hearing she grabbed a colleague and ran outside .
i sincerely hope that a wider inquiry will help prevent this from happening to another woman clare bernal 's mother patricia " there was one big bang and then i heard about three more - there must have been four or five shots . "
pathologist dr vesna djurovic said ms bernal was shot four times - once in the back of the head and three times in the face .
adjourning the case to 19 january , dr knapman said : " it may be that i will make a decision -lsb- on widening the scope of the inquest -rsb- . "
in a statement after the hearing , ms bernal 's mother patricia said : " i was very close to my daughter and miss her terribly .

in a series of candid comments , mr green said bhs was failing to offer its customers the products they wanted .
" some of the merchandise is n't right and the market is very tough , " he told bbc five live .
" when you have n't got the merchandise right ... customers do n't want to buy it or want to buy it cheaper , " he said .

however , he told the bbc that bhs was not trading " any better or worse than anybody else is " .
mr green last month paid himself a £ 1.2bn dividend from arcadia , after the privately-held group reported a rise in profits to £ 252.8m from £ 246.3m last year .

about 10,000 participants are expected at the three-day event members of the united nations are currently engaged in a debate of historic proportions that may well determine the future evolution of the internet .
the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- in tunis , tunisia , has ostensibly been about ensuring that poor countries benefit from information and communication technologies .
but behind the scenes a deeper battle of ideas has been taking place , between the age-old political model of top-down control and the 21st-century networked model of bottom-up cooperation and coordination .
it is essential that the outcome not be detrimental to the benefits the information society has to offer .
' unfortunate approach ' from its foundation , the researchers and business people who built the internet have operated according to a set of common values .
these include ensuring that the net works as a single interoperable system , that decisions are made from the bottom up , that anyone who wishes to can participate , and that innovation occurs on the edge .
icann 's work ensures that nearly 250,000 interconnected private networks act as a single internet in the eyes of a billion users icann ceo paul twomey send us your comments only in the past three years have diplomats started paying attention to the way the internet is operated .
it is unfortunate , but perhaps understandable , that they have approached it with a " top down " mindset conditioned by earlier heavily regulated industries and political models of addressing international issues .
central to the discussion is the role of icann , the non-profit internet corporation for assigned names and numbers , of which i am president .
icann coordinates , not controls , the unique identifier system that binds the internet together , including all the domain names and protocol addresses .
icann works according to the existing internet model of cooperation and collaboration , and encourages all members of the global net community , including the technical community , civil society and governments , to become more involved in its development .
and it has worked well .
250,000 networks however , this " multi-stakeholder " approach is still alien to many governments , or at least their diplomatic representatives , in part because it is a new model .
their failure to grasp it is apparent in their often-heard refrain , " icann should not run the internet " .
icann , of course , does no such thing .
much of the media coverage has focused on icann 's role so what does icann do ?
to use a loose analogy , if the internet were a postal system , the icann community ensures that the addresses on the envelopes work .
what it does not do is determine what should be in the envelope , deliver the letter or decide who can read it .
to give some idea of the scale of this task , icann 's work ensures that nearly 250,000 interconnected private networks act as a single internet in the eyes of a billion users .
these functions support more than 27 billion user sessions per day , about nine times the daily number of phone calls in north america .
the icann community supports the continuing globalisation of internet governance and where the organisation can play a role in its development , it is more than willing to do so .
in fact , it is part of icann 's bylaws , and its operating culture , to welcome such stakeholder driven review of its structures and procedures .
icann has evolution and reform hot wired into its bylaws .
it also has a proven history of implementing these reforms talking to governments last week , vint cerf , chairman of the icann board wrote to mohamed sharil tarmizi , senior advisor to the malaysian communications and multimedia commission and chair of the icann governmental advisory committee -lrb- gac -rrb- .
the gac has more than 100 member governments and membership is open to all governments .
in his letter , vint acknowledged that the current discussions on internet governance relate directly to the gac and that a question exists as to how the role of the committee could be strengthened within the existing multi-stakeholder mechanism and made more effective .
this will be a topic of discussion at icann 's next international meeting , taking place in vancouver at the end of the month .
from icann 's viewpoint , the internet 's future success , in all aspects , is dependent on the continued participation of the entire internet community through the existing multi-stakeholder mechanism , rather than a top-down model with governmental control .

about 10,000 participants are expected at the three-day event members of the united nations are currently engaged in a debate of historic proportions that may well determine the future evolution of the internet .
the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- in tunis , tunisia , has ostensibly been about ensuring that poor countries benefit from information and communication technologies .
but behind the scenes a deeper battle of ideas has been taking place , between the age-old political model of top-down control and the 21st-century networked model of bottom-up cooperation and coordination .
it is essential that the outcome not be detrimental to the benefits the information society has to offer .
' unfortunate approach ' from its foundation , the researchers and business people who built the internet have operated according to a set of common values .
these include ensuring that the net works as a single interoperable system , that decisions are made from the bottom up , that anyone who wishes to can participate , and that innovation occurs on the edge .
icann 's work ensures that nearly 250,000 interconnected private networks act as a single internet in the eyes of a billion users icann ceo paul twomey send us your comments only in the past three years have diplomats started paying attention to the way the internet is operated .
it is unfortunate , but perhaps understandable , that they have approached it with a " top down " mindset conditioned by earlier heavily regulated industries and political models of addressing international issues .
central to the discussion is the role of icann , the non-profit internet corporation for assigned names and numbers , of which i am president .
icann coordinates , not controls , the unique identifier system that binds the internet together , including all the domain names and protocol addresses .
icann works according to the existing internet model of cooperation and collaboration , and encourages all members of the global net community , including the technical community , civil society and governments , to become more involved in its development .
and it has worked well .
250,000 networks however , this " multi-stakeholder " approach is still alien to many governments , or at least their diplomatic representatives , in part because it is a new model .
their failure to grasp it is apparent in their often-heard refrain , " icann should not run the internet " .
icann , of course , does no such thing .
much of the media coverage has focused on icann 's role so what does icann do ?
to use a loose analogy , if the internet were a postal system , the icann community ensures that the addresses on the envelopes work .
what it does not do is determine what should be in the envelope , deliver the letter or decide who can read it .
to give some idea of the scale of this task , icann 's work ensures that nearly 250,000 interconnected private networks act as a single internet in the eyes of a billion users .
these functions support more than 27 billion user sessions per day , about nine times the daily number of phone calls in north america .
the icann community supports the continuing globalisation of internet governance and where the organisation can play a role in its development , it is more than willing to do so .
in fact , it is part of icann 's bylaws , and its operating culture , to welcome such stakeholder driven review of its structures and procedures .
icann has evolution and reform hot wired into its bylaws .
it also has a proven history of implementing these reforms talking to governments last week , vint cerf , chairman of the icann board wrote to mohamed sharil tarmizi , senior advisor to the malaysian communications and multimedia commission and chair of the icann governmental advisory committee -lrb- gac -rrb- .
the gac has more than 100 member governments and membership is open to all governments .
in his letter , vint acknowledged that the current discussions on internet governance relate directly to the gac and that a question exists as to how the role of the committee could be strengthened within the existing multi-stakeholder mechanism and made more effective .
this will be a topic of discussion at icann 's next international meeting , taking place in vancouver at the end of the month .
from icann 's viewpoint , the internet 's future success , in all aspects , is dependent on the continued participation of the entire internet community through the existing multi-stakeholder mechanism , rather than a top-down model with governmental control .
