but according to consumer protection officials , that 's what makes them all the more dangerous , since the powder inside contains alcohol , and a lot of it - about 4.8 percent by volume .
that is the equivalent of one to one-and-a-half glasses of liquor . the product is called subyou , manufactured by a company in north rhine-westphalia , and is marketed squarely at teenagers with slogans like " taste for not much dough " and " gets a good buzz going . "
add the powder to cold water , and consumers have an alcoholic drink containing either vodka or rum . " these are just as dangerous as the alcopops that came in the bottles , " birgit rehlender , nutrition expert at consumer affairs organization stiftung warentest told der spiegel weekly . tax exempt while authorities were able to curtail the consumption of alcopops with a special tax on the drinks last august - which put them out of the reach of many teenage budgets - these new alcopops in powder form cost between 1.65 and 2.40 euros -lrb- $ 2.06 and $ 3.00 -rrb- per package .
subyou is able to get around the tax because its product comes in powder form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the little packets that pack a wallop the powder was first sold over the internet , and word spread quickly among teenage circles that those under 18 could order off the internet without fear of being asked for proof of age .
however , according to andrea schauff , a nutritional expert at hesse 's consumer protection organization , in many stores the powder is being sold to under-age kids even though a warning is printed on the packets : " alcohol can be addictive - no sales to minors . " besides the high alcohol content , youth advocates also worry about the powder 's other ingredients , including high levels of preservatives , sorbic acid , and dyes that have not been approved by health experts . consumer protection authorities , such as waltraud fesser from rhineland-palatinate , would like to see the special tax on liquid alcopops be applied to their cousins in powder form . " as soon as alcohol enters into the picture , we have to protect our young people , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe takes on alcopops in an attempt to tackle teenage alcohol consumption , european politicians are targeting alcopops , the trendy fruit-flavored alcoholic beverages preferred by young drinkers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2005 conservatism : the new rebellion ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fresh face of german youth much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ? politically at least , germany does indeed appear to be in the midst of a shift back to the right , although there are plenty who argue that it is not so much the conservative christian democrats who are rising in popularity as the left-of-center social democrats who have fallen out of favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany governed by conservatives - in black but this generation of young germans has a decided lack of interest in the political issues of their society , and are much more interested in themselves than anything else .
while that might seem like a given for adolescents and their seniors in some countries , it seems that this burgeoning bent towards self-centered behavior is news for germany . loud are the cries that youngsters up and down the country are displaying signs of the very conservative values their emancipated parents educated them against .
trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie . " we have seen a shift from an educated society to what one might politely call a " taste society , " in which it is no longer important to know about schiller , but to be eating and wearing the right things , " retzbach said . chasing the mainstream granted there is now a movement away from the post-materialist values which have stood germany in good stead over the past three decades , such as interest in the environment , politics and the nation 's favorite ideologies . but klaus boehnke , professor of social science methodology , said that rather than slipping back into the ways of their grandparents , young people are simply evolving in keeping with society . bildunterschrift : clothes count for young germans " what we see now has a lot to do with german unification .

but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles . chirac 's appeal came as a " no " vote looked more and more likely , the latest opinion polls give the treaty ’ s opponents 55 percent .
the president called the proposed constitution vital to france 's future and implored voters not to use the trip to the polls as a chance to vote against his government .
thursday 's primetime broadcast , which was carried by all the main channels , was the french president 's final chance .
even though he went on tv urging for a " yes , " it was his opponents who gained momentum , giving them a 10-point lead two days ahead of the referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac tried to outline the constitution 's advantages thursday night " europeans would perceive a rejection of the treaty as a ' no ' to europe , " chirac said , hoping to influence the 20 percent of voters who remain undecided or said they may change their mind before voting .
" it would open a period of divisions , doubts , uncertainties . "
he went on to list the advantages the treaty held for france as he saw it : a more powerful voice in europe with stronger voting rights and protection of the traditional french social economic model .
opponents increase lead the problem for the president and all the other " yes " campaigners is that these arguments have had no lasting impact .
even efforts by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german chancellor gerhard schröder , who are due in france late friday , to lend a helping hand to the stumbling " yes " bid may come too late as the " no " camp remains stubbornly ahead .

' ' we must not mistake the question , " chirac said .
' ' it is not about saying ' yes ' or ' no ' to the government .
it is about your future , that of your children , of the future of france and the future of europe . "
though it may be too little too late , chirac hinted that he would shake up his team in the event of a negative vote by promising to bring a " new impetus " to his team .
though he ruled out his own resignation , some expect to see france 's most popular right-wing politician , nicolas sarkozy , taking over for current prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .

the president called the proposed constitution vital to france 's future and implored voters not to use the trip to the polls as a chance to vote against his government .
thursday 's primetime broadcast , which was carried by all the main channels , was the french president 's final chance .
even though he went on tv urging for a " yes , " it was his opponents who gained momentum , giving them a 10-point lead two days ahead of the referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac tried to outline the constitution 's advantages thursday night " europeans would perceive a rejection of the treaty as a ' no ' to europe , " chirac said , hoping to influence the 20 percent of voters who remain undecided or said they may change their mind before voting .
" it would open a period of divisions , doubts , uncertainties . "

he 's pictured here with polish president aleksander kwasniewski , right , and german chancellor gerhard schröder , center as french unemployment hovers at 10 percent and chirac 's approval rating at 39 percent , the referendum is largely seen as much more of a plebiscite for his government than a decision on the constitution itself .
' ' we must not mistake the question , " chirac said .
' ' it is not about saying ' yes ' or ' no ' to the government .
it is about your future , that of your children , of the future of france and the future of europe . "
though it may be too little too late , chirac hinted that he would shake up his team in the event of a negative vote by promising to bring a " new impetus " to his team .
though he ruled out his own resignation , some expect to see france 's most popular right-wing politician , nicolas sarkozy , taking over for current prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .

germany is the ninth country to ratify the european constitution .
austria , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain have already done so .
the timing of the bundesrat vote was chosen to send a signal to the draft 's supporters of in france .
but recent polls suggest it will not be enough to win over french sceptics who fear the charter will entrench a free-market model that puts capitalism ahead of social concerns .
" no " camp ahead in france french president jacques chirac will hope that the german message arrives in time , as polls show the french " no " camp ahead with 55 percent to the supporters ' 45 percent .

a " milestone " for europe bundesrat president matthias platzeck called the constitution a " milestone " in european development that would increase the union 's international influence as well as make it a more democratic and transparent .
though the necessary two-thirds approval in germany was never in question , mecklenburg-vorpommern abstained from the roll call .
the state held backs its vote because ruling coalition of social democrats and party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , could not reach a common position .
earlier this month a poll from infratest dimap showed that 59 percent of germans would have voted for the treaty , had the been given the chance as another study from omniquest showed 77 percent of them wished they could .
now the constitution only needs to be signed by german president horst köhler before it becomes binding .
that step is considered a formality . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution president jacques chirac has made a last televised plea to the french people urging them to vote in favor of the european constitution on sunday .
but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles .
-lrb- may 27 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .

the commission said that the new immigration law needs to abolish this status with refugees more easily able to receive a residency permit . since january , when the law came into effect , the federal immigration agency hardly grants any permanent residency permits anymore and is extending the temporary ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marieluise beck " the fact that this kettenduldung has not been done away with is inconsistent and shows the true intention of lawmakers , " said marielouise beck , the federal government 's migration commissioner . immigration policy needs rethinking volker beck , a green party member of parliament , blamed german interior minister otto schilly for this , saying that his bureaucracy that has successfully " boycotted " the humanitarian implementation of the law . immigration experts also urged a rethinking of policies to better reflect the realities of immigration and cultural diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily persented the migration commission 's first report last october " the integration of foreigners in germany must be , in the future , more than just paper pushing over where and how they are to live , " said marieluise beck .
these days , every fourth newborn in germany has a foreign parent , making the debates over a multicultural society rather superfluous , she added . " schools , hospitals , old-age homes , the workplace , they all must be in the position to be able to deal with diversity and must open themselves to it , " she said . need more integration courses representatives also took issue over the integration courses that were introduced for foreigners in january : there is more interest than available slots , beck said . according to the new law , each immigrant has the right to take part in such a course .
at the same time , foreigners who do n't take the course or who drop out can expect sanctions .
beck and her colleagues say that the government needs to create more of these courses .
the government has allotted about 264 million euros -lrb- $ 331 million -rrb- annually for the classes . another complaint was the failure of the government to address naturalization issues , particularly one affecting young turkish men .
in this case , their naturalization is hampered because of the compulsory military service demanded by turkey , representatives said .
such recruits can buy their way out of doing military service but it costs 10,000 euros , a sum few can pay . bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danish immigration policies hinder love they may have hearts on their currency but these days , some danes and their foreign spouses are calling increasingly tougher danish immigration policies heartless and moving to neighboring countries .

thursday 's primetime broadcast , which was carried by all the main channels , was the french president 's final chance .

a " milestone " for europe bundesrat president matthias platzeck called the constitution a " milestone " in european development that would increase the union 's international influence as well as make it a more democratic and transparent .
though the necessary two-thirds approval in germany was never in question , mecklenburg-vorpommern abstained from the roll call .
the state held backs its vote because ruling coalition of social democrats and party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , could not reach a common position .
earlier this month a poll from infratest dimap showed that 59 percent of germans would have voted for the treaty , had the been given the chance as another study from omniquest showed 77 percent of them wished they could .

be afraid ... be very afraid .
not content with bugging the majority of people in the western world with its grindingly annoying phone ringtone , crazy frog is set to take the charts by storm thanks to a german dance act . what 's blue , annoying and anatomically incorrect ?
without spending much time debating the possibilities , many people who have been bombarded for months with adverts on television , ring tones on the bus and now invasive snippets on the radio will soon come to the answer : crazy frog . more than just a passing fad , the evil love-child of an unholy union between some very bored swedes and a german dance act is set to become britain 's first ringtone inspired chart topper . when the polls come in on bbc radio one 's chart show on sunday , it is likely that crazy frog will beat the new and hugely anticipated single from rock group coldplay to the coveted top slot . bored swedes with too much time on their hands the manic animated amphibian which began its ascent to the top of the music charts on the back of a phone jingle was spawned seven years ago by daniel malmedahl , a computer salesman from gothenburg .
malmedahl , who has a ' talent ' for replicating every day noises , recorded his impression of a friends ' motorbike on his computer as a joke . that joke ended up on the internet where fellow swede erik wernquist , a designer of 3-d graphics , decided to build a character to fit the excruciating sound .
crazy frog was born . unfortunately , the blue frog with a belly-button , 1950s style crash helmet and human genitalia -lrb- which are blocked out on british tv due to complaints by the advertising standards authority -rrb- did n't die a death as a junk mail joke destined for the trash can of internet history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids just ca n't get enough of the crazy frog while adults ca n't stand it !
instead , it was picked up by ring tone company jamster and flogged mercilessly and relentlessly across all mediums .
to date , jamster has made more than 13 million euros -lrb- about $ 16 million -rrb- from people downloading crazy frog ringtones . german dance act with something against music but it has n't stopped there .
not content with hearing what resembles a skoda on its last legs trying to pick up speed in every bus , train and public place courtesy of mobile phones , jamster is set to make another fortune thanks to german dance act bass bumpers who have combined the flatulent-sounding frog with the theme from beverly hills cop for an assault on the music industry . the cd is apparently outselling british band coldplay 's new single " speed of sound " by more than four to one with an estimated 400,000 copies of crazy frog already on order across the uk , according to the label gut records who is distributing the ' musical ' monstrosity . the frog is big business and with a number one single under its helmet , the anthropomorphic amphibian is expected to be just the first of a number of painful phone tie-ins which make it into the charts . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danger : exploding toads the residents of hamburg have been told to avoid one of the city 's lakes after a spate of mysterious explosions in the area .

the commission said that the new immigration law needs to abolish this status with refugees more easily able to receive a residency permit . since january , when the law came into effect , the federal immigration agency hardly grants any permanent residency permits anymore and is extending the temporary ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marieluise beck " the fact that this kettenduldung has not been done away with is inconsistent and shows the true intention of lawmakers , " said marielouise beck , the federal government 's migration commissioner . immigration policy needs rethinking volker beck , a green party member of parliament , blamed german interior minister otto schilly for this , saying that his bureaucracy that has successfully " boycotted " the humanitarian implementation of the law . immigration experts also urged a rethinking of policies to better reflect the realities of immigration and cultural diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily persented the migration commission 's first report last october " the integration of foreigners in germany must be , in the future , more than just paper pushing over where and how they are to live , " said marieluise beck .
these days , every fourth newborn in germany has a foreign parent , making the debates over a multicultural society rather superfluous , she added . " schools , hospitals , old-age homes , the workplace , they all must be in the position to be able to deal with diversity and must open themselves to it , " she said . need more integration courses representatives also took issue over the integration courses that were introduced for foreigners in january : there is more interest than available slots , beck said . according to the new law , each immigrant has the right to take part in such a course .
at the same time , foreigners who do n't take the course or who drop out can expect sanctions .
beck and her colleagues say that the government needs to create more of these courses .
the government has allotted about 264 million euros -lrb- $ 331 million -rrb- annually for the classes . another complaint was the failure of the government to address naturalization issues , particularly one affecting young turkish men .
in this case , their naturalization is hampered because of the compulsory military service demanded by turkey , representatives said .
such recruits can buy their way out of doing military service but it costs 10,000 euros , a sum few can pay . bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danish immigration policies hinder love they may have hearts on their currency but these days , some danes and their foreign spouses are calling increasingly tougher danish immigration policies heartless and moving to neighboring countries .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany governed by conservatives - in black but this generation of young germans has a decided lack of interest in the political issues of their society , and are much more interested in themselves than anything else .
while that might seem like a given for adolescents and their seniors in some countries , it seems that this burgeoning bent towards self-centered behavior is news for germany . loud are the cries that youngsters up and down the country are displaying signs of the very conservative values their emancipated parents educated them against .
trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie . " we have seen a shift from an educated society to what one might politely call a " taste society , " in which it is no longer important to know about schiller , but to be eating and wearing the right things , " retzbach said . chasing the mainstream granted there is now a movement away from the post-materialist values which have stood germany in good stead over the past three decades , such as interest in the environment , politics and the nation 's favorite ideologies . but klaus boehnke , professor of social science methodology , said that rather than slipping back into the ways of their grandparents , young people are simply evolving in keeping with society . bildunterschrift : clothes count for young germans " what we see now has a lot to do with german unification .

" because of that , they are looking for a vision which includes security , a relationship and family . " trend analyst retzbach says the desire for the family idyll of spouse , children and a house with a garden has been gaining ground over recent years .
he said germany is experiencing a perceptible return to traditional family values in which youngsters are not only willing to wait for a serious relationship before having sex , but in which they have begun looking to the church - and its intrinsic values - as a point of orientation for their lives . but peschel rejected such claims as unsubstantiated . " the idea that young germans have become sexually prudent is nothing more than a peripheral phenomenon which has been given a mainstream focus by the media , " he said .

he said germany is experiencing a perceptible return to traditional family values in which youngsters are not only willing to wait for a serious relationship before having sex , but in which they have begun looking to the church - and its intrinsic values - as a point of orientation for their lives . but peschel rejected such claims as unsubstantiated .

the commission said that the new immigration law needs to abolish this status with refugees more easily able to receive a residency permit . since january , when the law came into effect , the federal immigration agency hardly grants any permanent residency permits anymore and is extending the temporary ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marieluise beck " the fact that this kettenduldung has not been done away with is inconsistent and shows the true intention of lawmakers , " said marielouise beck , the federal government 's migration commissioner . immigration policy needs rethinking volker beck , a green party member of parliament , blamed german interior minister otto schilly for this , saying that his bureaucracy that has successfully " boycotted " the humanitarian implementation of the law . immigration experts also urged a rethinking of policies to better reflect the realities of immigration and cultural diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily persented the migration commission 's first report last october " the integration of foreigners in germany must be , in the future , more than just paper pushing over where and how they are to live , " said marieluise beck .
these days , every fourth newborn in germany has a foreign parent , making the debates over a multicultural society rather superfluous , she added . " schools , hospitals , old-age homes , the workplace , they all must be in the position to be able to deal with diversity and must open themselves to it , " she said . need more integration courses representatives also took issue over the integration courses that were introduced for foreigners in january : there is more interest than available slots , beck said . according to the new law , each immigrant has the right to take part in such a course .
at the same time , foreigners who do n't take the course or who drop out can expect sanctions .
beck and her colleagues say that the government needs to create more of these courses .
the government has allotted about 264 million euros -lrb- $ 331 million -rrb- annually for the classes . another complaint was the failure of the government to address naturalization issues , particularly one affecting young turkish men .
in this case , their naturalization is hampered because of the compulsory military service demanded by turkey , representatives said .
such recruits can buy their way out of doing military service but it costs 10,000 euros , a sum few can pay . bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danish immigration policies hinder love they may have hearts on their currency but these days , some danes and their foreign spouses are calling increasingly tougher danish immigration policies heartless and moving to neighboring countries .

the commission said that the new immigration law needs to abolish this status with refugees more easily able to receive a residency permit . since january , when the law came into effect , the federal immigration agency hardly grants any permanent residency permits anymore and is extending the temporary ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marieluise beck " the fact that this kettenduldung has not been done away with is inconsistent and shows the true intention of lawmakers , " said marielouise beck , the federal government 's migration commissioner . immigration policy needs rethinking volker beck , a green party member of parliament , blamed german interior minister otto schilly for this , saying that his bureaucracy that has successfully " boycotted " the humanitarian implementation of the law . immigration experts also urged a rethinking of policies to better reflect the realities of immigration and cultural diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily persented the migration commission 's first report last october " the integration of foreigners in germany must be , in the future , more than just paper pushing over where and how they are to live , " said marieluise beck .
these days , every fourth newborn in germany has a foreign parent , making the debates over a multicultural society rather superfluous , she added . " schools , hospitals , old-age homes , the workplace , they all must be in the position to be able to deal with diversity and must open themselves to it , " she said . need more integration courses representatives also took issue over the integration courses that were introduced for foreigners in january : there is more interest than available slots , beck said . according to the new law , each immigrant has the right to take part in such a course .
at the same time , foreigners who do n't take the course or who drop out can expect sanctions .
beck and her colleagues say that the government needs to create more of these courses .
the government has allotted about 264 million euros -lrb- $ 331 million -rrb- annually for the classes . another complaint was the failure of the government to address naturalization issues , particularly one affecting young turkish men .
in this case , their naturalization is hampered because of the compulsory military service demanded by turkey , representatives said .
such recruits can buy their way out of doing military service but it costs 10,000 euros , a sum few can pay . bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danish immigration policies hinder love they may have hearts on their currency but these days , some danes and their foreign spouses are calling increasingly tougher danish immigration policies heartless and moving to neighboring countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2005 dossier : france and the eu 's future when the heads of the eu 's member states signed their names to the proposed constitution in october 2004 , they knew they would have a hard time convincing the union 's 450 million people to accept it .
they agreed the british would be skeptical and that it would be difficult to persuade poland to vote for the document , but few expected they would have to go to such great lengths to get france to sign off on the document .
the 448-article constitution has divided france , sometimes bitterly .
even the french socialists , once thought to be firmly behind the constitution , are split into two camps .
supporters say the proposed treaty would give france more international influence while making the eu more democratic and transparent .
the other side maintains that the constitution abandons france 's social welfare model for a free-wheeling , us-style free-market system .
opponents also argue it gives too much power to brussels .
the " yes " camp started ahead , but domestic troubles in france have given the " no " side a clear and stable lead in the campaign 's final weeks .
still , up to 20 percent of french voters say they are still undecided or willing to change their minds .
dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution . dw-world.de chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution president jacques chirac has made a last televised plea to the french people urging them to vote in favor of the european constitution on sunday .
but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles .
-lrb- may 27 , 2005 -rrb- expected french ' non ' hits euro the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .
but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls .
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- courting the constitution europe is no leader in the game of creating hot gossip but the constitution sure has the continent chattering .
the question is , does anyone really know what their tongues are wagging about ?
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .
-lrb- april 2 , 2005 -rrb- europe can weather constitution refusal politicians have warned the french that voting down the eu constitution would push the eu into a period of introspection and even lead to the collapse of the union .
other observers say it 's not as bad as all that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2005 dossier : france and the eu 's future when the heads of the eu 's member states signed their names to the proposed constitution in october 2004 , they knew they would have a hard time convincing the union 's 450 million people to accept it .
they agreed the british would be skeptical and that it would be difficult to persuade poland to vote for the document , but few expected they would have to go to such great lengths to get france to sign off on the document .
the 448-article constitution has divided france , sometimes bitterly .
even the french socialists , once thought to be firmly behind the constitution , are split into two camps .
supporters say the proposed treaty would give france more international influence while making the eu more democratic and transparent .
the other side maintains that the constitution abandons france 's social welfare model for a free-wheeling , us-style free-market system .
opponents also argue it gives too much power to brussels .
the " yes " camp started ahead , but domestic troubles in france have given the " no " side a clear and stable lead in the campaign 's final weeks .
still , up to 20 percent of french voters say they are still undecided or willing to change their minds .
dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution . dw-world.de chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution president jacques chirac has made a last televised plea to the french people urging them to vote in favor of the european constitution on sunday .
but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles .
-lrb- may 27 , 2005 -rrb- expected french ' non ' hits euro the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .
but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls .
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- courting the constitution europe is no leader in the game of creating hot gossip but the constitution sure has the continent chattering .
the question is , does anyone really know what their tongues are wagging about ?
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .
-lrb- april 2 , 2005 -rrb- europe can weather constitution refusal politicians have warned the french that voting down the eu constitution would push the eu into a period of introspection and even lead to the collapse of the union .
other observers say it 's not as bad as all that .

that is similar to the mood seven years ago when helmut kohl lost his bid for a fifth term , when 64 percent of the electorate said it was time for a change . however , in a similar poll carried out by tns infratest for der spiegel news magazine , 41 percent said they would vote for schröder as opposed to 37 percent for merkel .
however , if parliamentary elections were held this weekend , schröder 's spd would get only 29 percent of the vote .

but according to consumer protection officials , that 's what makes them all the more dangerous , since the powder inside contains alcohol , and a lot of it - about 4.8 percent by volume .
that is the equivalent of one to one-and-a-half glasses of liquor . the product is called subyou , manufactured by a company in north rhine-westphalia , and is marketed squarely at teenagers with slogans like " taste for not much dough " and " gets a good buzz going . "
add the powder to cold water , and consumers have an alcoholic drink containing either vodka or rum . " these are just as dangerous as the alcopops that came in the bottles , " birgit rehlender , nutrition expert at consumer affairs organization stiftung warentest told der spiegel weekly . tax exempt while authorities were able to curtail the consumption of alcopops with a special tax on the drinks last august - which put them out of the reach of many teenage budgets - these new alcopops in powder form cost between 1.65 and 2.40 euros -lrb- $ 2.06 and $ 3.00 -rrb- per package .
subyou is able to get around the tax because its product comes in powder form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the little packets that pack a wallop the powder was first sold over the internet , and word spread quickly among teenage circles that those under 18 could order off the internet without fear of being asked for proof of age .
however , according to andrea schauff , a nutritional expert at hesse 's consumer protection organization , in many stores the powder is being sold to under-age kids even though a warning is printed on the packets : " alcohol can be addictive - no sales to minors . " besides the high alcohol content , youth advocates also worry about the powder 's other ingredients , including high levels of preservatives , sorbic acid , and dyes that have not been approved by health experts . consumer protection authorities , such as waltraud fesser from rhineland-palatinate , would like to see the special tax on liquid alcopops be applied to their cousins in powder form . " as soon as alcohol enters into the picture , we have to protect our young people , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe takes on alcopops in an attempt to tackle teenage alcohol consumption , european politicians are targeting alcopops , the trendy fruit-flavored alcoholic beverages preferred by young drinkers .

but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ? politically at least , germany does indeed appear to be in the midst of a shift back to the right , although there are plenty who argue that it is not so much the conservative christian democrats who are rising in popularity as the left-of-center social democrats who have fallen out of favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany governed by conservatives - in black but this generation of young germans has a decided lack of interest in the political issues of their society , and are much more interested in themselves than anything else .
while that might seem like a given for adolescents and their seniors in some countries , it seems that this burgeoning bent towards self-centered behavior is news for germany . loud are the cries that youngsters up and down the country are displaying signs of the very conservative values their emancipated parents educated them against .
trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie . " we have seen a shift from an educated society to what one might politely call a " taste society , " in which it is no longer important to know about schiller , but to be eating and wearing the right things , " retzbach said . chasing the mainstream granted there is now a movement away from the post-materialist values which have stood germany in good stead over the past three decades , such as interest in the environment , politics and the nation 's favorite ideologies . but klaus boehnke , professor of social science methodology , said that rather than slipping back into the ways of their grandparents , young people are simply evolving in keeping with society . bildunterschrift : clothes count for young germans " what we see now has a lot to do with german unification .

" young people see that their parents have to move because of work , and they see how rare it is to get a job for life , " he said .
" because of that , they are looking for a vision which includes security , a relationship and family . " trend analyst retzbach says the desire for the family idyll of spouse , children and a house with a garden has been gaining ground over recent years .
he said germany is experiencing a perceptible return to traditional family values in which youngsters are not only willing to wait for a serious relationship before having sex , but in which they have begun looking to the church - and its intrinsic values - as a point of orientation for their lives . but peschel rejected such claims as unsubstantiated . " the idea that young germans have become sexually prudent is nothing more than a peripheral phenomenon which has been given a mainstream focus by the media , " he said . " the majority of young people behave exactly the same as youngsters 20 years ago . " looming baby boom ? the combination of sexual mores that are as relaxed as ever and the small percentage of people making the move back to more rooted family values is not without implication for germany 's stagnant birth rate . although there has been a slight increase in the number of young people giving birth , the institute for population research says it would be wrong to suggest there is any sign of a baby boom on the horizon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before they start thinking about taking on the responsibility for an increased number of offspring , the upcoming generation has to find its own identity , whatever name it is given .

but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ? politically at least , germany does indeed appear to be in the midst of a shift back to the right , although there are plenty who argue that it is not so much the conservative christian democrats who are rising in popularity as the left-of-center social democrats who have fallen out of favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany governed by conservatives - in black but this generation of young germans has a decided lack of interest in the political issues of their society , and are much more interested in themselves than anything else .
while that might seem like a given for adolescents and their seniors in some countries , it seems that this burgeoning bent towards self-centered behavior is news for germany . loud are the cries that youngsters up and down the country are displaying signs of the very conservative values their emancipated parents educated them against .
trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie . " we have seen a shift from an educated society to what one might politely call a " taste society , " in which it is no longer important to know about schiller , but to be eating and wearing the right things , " retzbach said . chasing the mainstream granted there is now a movement away from the post-materialist values which have stood germany in good stead over the past three decades , such as interest in the environment , politics and the nation 's favorite ideologies . but klaus boehnke , professor of social science methodology , said that rather than slipping back into the ways of their grandparents , young people are simply evolving in keeping with society . bildunterschrift : clothes count for young germans " what we see now has a lot to do with german unification .

" young people see that their parents have to move because of work , and they see how rare it is to get a job for life , " he said .
" because of that , they are looking for a vision which includes security , a relationship and family . " trend analyst retzbach says the desire for the family idyll of spouse , children and a house with a garden has been gaining ground over recent years .
he said germany is experiencing a perceptible return to traditional family values in which youngsters are not only willing to wait for a serious relationship before having sex , but in which they have begun looking to the church - and its intrinsic values - as a point of orientation for their lives . but peschel rejected such claims as unsubstantiated . " the idea that young germans have become sexually prudent is nothing more than a peripheral phenomenon which has been given a mainstream focus by the media , " he said . " the majority of young people behave exactly the same as youngsters 20 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2005 conservatism : the new rebellion ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fresh face of german youth much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ? politically at least , germany does indeed appear to be in the midst of a shift back to the right , although there are plenty who argue that it is not so much the conservative christian democrats who are rising in popularity as the left-of-center social democrats who have fallen out of favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany governed by conservatives - in black but this generation of young germans has a decided lack of interest in the political issues of their society , and are much more interested in themselves than anything else .
while that might seem like a given for adolescents and their seniors in some countries , it seems that this burgeoning bent towards self-centered behavior is news for germany . loud are the cries that youngsters up and down the country are displaying signs of the very conservative values their emancipated parents educated them against .
trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie . " we have seen a shift from an educated society to what one might politely call a " taste society , " in which it is no longer important to know about schiller , but to be eating and wearing the right things , " retzbach said . chasing the mainstream granted there is now a movement away from the post-materialist values which have stood germany in good stead over the past three decades , such as interest in the environment , politics and the nation 's favorite ideologies . but klaus boehnke , professor of social science methodology , said that rather than slipping back into the ways of their grandparents , young people are simply evolving in keeping with society . bildunterschrift : clothes count for young germans " what we see now has a lot to do with german unification .
the current economic crisis has pushed interest in individual circumstances to the foreground , " boehnke said .
" it is easier to be generous about the world and society when everyone is doing well than when people are struggling . " tales of old and germany , by all accounts , is struggling .
plagued by persistently high unemployment figures and unpopular social welfare reforms , it 's hard to shake a collective smile out of the older generations who recall an altogether more sanguine existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise found wolfgang peschel of the german federal youth council said the new wave of self-interest among the younger generation is a direct consequence of having witnessed their own parents ' struggles . " young people see that their parents have to move because of work , and they see how rare it is to get a job for life , " he said .
" because of that , they are looking for a vision which includes security , a relationship and family . " trend analyst retzbach says the desire for the family idyll of spouse , children and a house with a garden has been gaining ground over recent years .
he said germany is experiencing a perceptible return to traditional family values in which youngsters are not only willing to wait for a serious relationship before having sex , but in which they have begun looking to the church - and its intrinsic values - as a point of orientation for their lives . but peschel rejected such claims as unsubstantiated .

the commission said that the new immigration law needs to abolish this status with refugees more easily able to receive a residency permit . since january , when the law came into effect , the federal immigration agency hardly grants any permanent residency permits anymore and is extending the temporary ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marieluise beck " the fact that this kettenduldung has not been done away with is inconsistent and shows the true intention of lawmakers , " said marielouise beck , the federal government 's migration commissioner . immigration policy needs rethinking volker beck , a green party member of parliament , blamed german interior minister otto schilly for this , saying that his bureaucracy that has successfully " boycotted " the humanitarian implementation of the law . immigration experts also urged a rethinking of policies to better reflect the realities of immigration and cultural diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily persented the migration commission 's first report last october " the integration of foreigners in germany must be , in the future , more than just paper pushing over where and how they are to live , " said marieluise beck .

" schools , hospitals , old-age homes , the workplace , they all must be in the position to be able to deal with diversity and must open themselves to it , " she said . need more integration courses representatives also took issue over the integration courses that were introduced for foreigners in january : there is more interest than available slots , beck said . according to the new law , each immigrant has the right to take part in such a course .
at the same time , foreigners who do n't take the course or who drop out can expect sanctions .
beck and her colleagues say that the government needs to create more of these courses .
the government has allotted about 264 million euros -lrb- $ 331 million -rrb- annually for the classes . another complaint was the failure of the government to address naturalization issues , particularly one affecting young turkish men .
in this case , their naturalization is hampered because of the compulsory military service demanded by turkey , representatives said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2005 conservatism : the new rebellion ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fresh face of german youth much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ? politically at least , germany does indeed appear to be in the midst of a shift back to the right , although there are plenty who argue that it is not so much the conservative christian democrats who are rising in popularity as the left-of-center social democrats who have fallen out of favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany governed by conservatives - in black but this generation of young germans has a decided lack of interest in the political issues of their society , and are much more interested in themselves than anything else .
while that might seem like a given for adolescents and their seniors in some countries , it seems that this burgeoning bent towards self-centered behavior is news for germany . loud are the cries that youngsters up and down the country are displaying signs of the very conservative values their emancipated parents educated them against .
trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie . " we have seen a shift from an educated society to what one might politely call a " taste society , " in which it is no longer important to know about schiller , but to be eating and wearing the right things , " retzbach said . chasing the mainstream granted there is now a movement away from the post-materialist values which have stood germany in good stead over the past three decades , such as interest in the environment , politics and the nation 's favorite ideologies . but klaus boehnke , professor of social science methodology , said that rather than slipping back into the ways of their grandparents , young people are simply evolving in keeping with society . bildunterschrift : clothes count for young germans " what we see now has a lot to do with german unification .
the current economic crisis has pushed interest in individual circumstances to the foreground , " boehnke said .
" it is easier to be generous about the world and society when everyone is doing well than when people are struggling . " tales of old and germany , by all accounts , is struggling .

but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ? politically at least , germany does indeed appear to be in the midst of a shift back to the right , although there are plenty who argue that it is not so much the conservative christian democrats who are rising in popularity as the left-of-center social democrats who have fallen out of favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany governed by conservatives - in black but this generation of young germans has a decided lack of interest in the political issues of their society , and are much more interested in themselves than anything else .
while that might seem like a given for adolescents and their seniors in some countries , it seems that this burgeoning bent towards self-centered behavior is news for germany . loud are the cries that youngsters up and down the country are displaying signs of the very conservative values their emancipated parents educated them against .
trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie . " we have seen a shift from an educated society to what one might politely call a " taste society , " in which it is no longer important to know about schiller , but to be eating and wearing the right things , " retzbach said . chasing the mainstream granted there is now a movement away from the post-materialist values which have stood germany in good stead over the past three decades , such as interest in the environment , politics and the nation 's favorite ideologies . but klaus boehnke , professor of social science methodology , said that rather than slipping back into the ways of their grandparents , young people are simply evolving in keeping with society . bildunterschrift : clothes count for young germans " what we see now has a lot to do with german unification .
the current economic crisis has pushed interest in individual circumstances to the foreground , " boehnke said .
" it is easier to be generous about the world and society when everyone is doing well than when people are struggling . " tales of old and germany , by all accounts , is struggling .
plagued by persistently high unemployment figures and unpopular social welfare reforms , it 's hard to shake a collective smile out of the older generations who recall an altogether more sanguine existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise found wolfgang peschel of the german federal youth council said the new wave of self-interest among the younger generation is a direct consequence of having witnessed their own parents ' struggles . " young people see that their parents have to move because of work , and they see how rare it is to get a job for life , " he said .
" because of that , they are looking for a vision which includes security , a relationship and family . " trend analyst retzbach says the desire for the family idyll of spouse , children and a house with a garden has been gaining ground over recent years .
he said germany is experiencing a perceptible return to traditional family values in which youngsters are not only willing to wait for a serious relationship before having sex , but in which they have begun looking to the church - and its intrinsic values - as a point of orientation for their lives . but peschel rejected such claims as unsubstantiated . " the idea that young germans have become sexually prudent is nothing more than a peripheral phenomenon which has been given a mainstream focus by the media , " he said . " the majority of young people behave exactly the same as youngsters 20 years ago . " looming baby boom ? the combination of sexual mores that are as relaxed as ever and the small percentage of people making the move back to more rooted family values is not without implication for germany 's stagnant birth rate . although there has been a slight increase in the number of young people giving birth , the institute for population research says it would be wrong to suggest there is any sign of a baby boom on the horizon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before they start thinking about taking on the responsibility for an increased number of offspring , the upcoming generation has to find its own identity , whatever name it is given . " young people are not getting more conservative , but are simply trying to fit in with the political values of our society , and to simply make a nice life for themselves , " peschel said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dumbing down of germany a german politician was roundly criticized recently for commenting that only the " wrong people " were having children in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2005 critiquing germany 's immigration law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law has n't helped to give immigrants permanent status representatives of the federal , local and state governments met in berlin this week to discuss the implementation of the new immigration law and its shortcomings . the new law that 's meant to streamline immigration procedures , improve the integration of immigrants and ease entry for skilled workers in certain sectors is too restrictive , according to members of government-sponsored immigration commission . it fails to abolish a temporary status that keeps thousands of refugees in limbo , and does n't fully address integration and naturalization issues . for example , about 200,000 refugees have up till now received limited residency status - called a kettenduldung - a legal limbo that excludes both a permanent residency permit and deportation .
the commission said that the new immigration law needs to abolish this status with refugees more easily able to receive a residency permit . since january , when the law came into effect , the federal immigration agency hardly grants any permanent residency permits anymore and is extending the temporary ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marieluise beck " the fact that this kettenduldung has not been done away with is inconsistent and shows the true intention of lawmakers , " said marielouise beck , the federal government 's migration commissioner . immigration policy needs rethinking volker beck , a green party member of parliament , blamed german interior minister otto schilly for this , saying that his bureaucracy that has successfully " boycotted " the humanitarian implementation of the law . immigration experts also urged a rethinking of policies to better reflect the realities of immigration and cultural diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily persented the migration commission 's first report last october " the integration of foreigners in germany must be , in the future , more than just paper pushing over where and how they are to live , " said marieluise beck .
these days , every fourth newborn in germany has a foreign parent , making the debates over a multicultural society rather superfluous , she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2005 dossier : france and the eu 's future when the heads of the eu 's member states signed their names to the proposed constitution in october 2004 , they knew they would have a hard time convincing the union 's 450 million people to accept it .
they agreed the british would be skeptical and that it would be difficult to persuade poland to vote for the document , but few expected they would have to go to such great lengths to get france to sign off on the document .
the 448-article constitution has divided france , sometimes bitterly .
even the french socialists , once thought to be firmly behind the constitution , are split into two camps .
supporters say the proposed treaty would give france more international influence while making the eu more democratic and transparent .
the other side maintains that the constitution abandons france 's social welfare model for a free-wheeling , us-style free-market system .
opponents also argue it gives too much power to brussels .
the " yes " camp started ahead , but domestic troubles in france have given the " no " side a clear and stable lead in the campaign 's final weeks .
still , up to 20 percent of french voters say they are still undecided or willing to change their minds .
dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution . dw-world.de chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution president jacques chirac has made a last televised plea to the french people urging them to vote in favor of the european constitution on sunday .
but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles .
-lrb- may 27 , 2005 -rrb- expected french ' non ' hits euro the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .
but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls .
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- courting the constitution europe is no leader in the game of creating hot gossip but the constitution sure has the continent chattering .
the question is , does anyone really know what their tongues are wagging about ?
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .
-lrb- april 2 , 2005 -rrb- europe can weather constitution refusal politicians have warned the french that voting down the eu constitution would push the eu into a period of introspection and even lead to the collapse of the union .
other observers say it 's not as bad as all that .
-lrb- may 27 , 2004 -rrb- analysts : france may blow eu constitution a poll published in france on friday showed that 51 percent of french voters could vote " no " in a referendum on the european constitution .
a rejection by the french could kill the treaty .
-lrb- march 19 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .

thursday 's primetime broadcast , which was carried by all the main channels , was the french president 's final chance .

' ' we must not mistake the question , " chirac said .
' ' it is not about saying ' yes ' or ' no ' to the government .
it is about your future , that of your children , of the future of france and the future of europe . "
though it may be too little too late , chirac hinted that he would shake up his team in the event of a negative vote by promising to bring a " new impetus " to his team .

the commission said that the new immigration law needs to abolish this status with refugees more easily able to receive a residency permit . since january , when the law came into effect , the federal immigration agency hardly grants any permanent residency permits anymore and is extending the temporary ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marieluise beck " the fact that this kettenduldung has not been done away with is inconsistent and shows the true intention of lawmakers , " said marielouise beck , the federal government 's migration commissioner . immigration policy needs rethinking volker beck , a green party member of parliament , blamed german interior minister otto schilly for this , saying that his bureaucracy that has successfully " boycotted " the humanitarian implementation of the law . immigration experts also urged a rethinking of policies to better reflect the realities of immigration and cultural diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily persented the migration commission 's first report last october " the integration of foreigners in germany must be , in the future , more than just paper pushing over where and how they are to live , " said marieluise beck .
these days , every fourth newborn in germany has a foreign parent , making the debates over a multicultural society rather superfluous , she added . " schools , hospitals , old-age homes , the workplace , they all must be in the position to be able to deal with diversity and must open themselves to it , " she said . need more integration courses representatives also took issue over the integration courses that were introduced for foreigners in january : there is more interest than available slots , beck said . according to the new law , each immigrant has the right to take part in such a course .
at the same time , foreigners who do n't take the course or who drop out can expect sanctions .
beck and her colleagues say that the government needs to create more of these courses .
the government has allotted about 264 million euros -lrb- $ 331 million -rrb- annually for the classes . another complaint was the failure of the government to address naturalization issues , particularly one affecting young turkish men .
in this case , their naturalization is hampered because of the compulsory military service demanded by turkey , representatives said .
such recruits can buy their way out of doing military service but it costs 10,000 euros , a sum few can pay . bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danish immigration policies hinder love they may have hearts on their currency but these days , some danes and their foreign spouses are calling increasingly tougher danish immigration policies heartless and moving to neighboring countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2005 dossier : france and the eu 's future when the heads of the eu 's member states signed their names to the proposed constitution in october 2004 , they knew they would have a hard time convincing the union 's 450 million people to accept it .
they agreed the british would be skeptical and that it would be difficult to persuade poland to vote for the document , but few expected they would have to go to such great lengths to get france to sign off on the document .
the 448-article constitution has divided france , sometimes bitterly .
even the french socialists , once thought to be firmly behind the constitution , are split into two camps .
supporters say the proposed treaty would give france more international influence while making the eu more democratic and transparent .
the other side maintains that the constitution abandons france 's social welfare model for a free-wheeling , us-style free-market system .
opponents also argue it gives too much power to brussels .
the " yes " camp started ahead , but domestic troubles in france have given the " no " side a clear and stable lead in the campaign 's final weeks .
still , up to 20 percent of french voters say they are still undecided or willing to change their minds .
dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution . dw-world.de chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution president jacques chirac has made a last televised plea to the french people urging them to vote in favor of the european constitution on sunday .
but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles .
-lrb- may 27 , 2005 -rrb- expected french ' non ' hits euro the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .
but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls .
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- courting the constitution europe is no leader in the game of creating hot gossip but the constitution sure has the continent chattering .
the question is , does anyone really know what their tongues are wagging about ?
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .
-lrb- april 2 , 2005 -rrb- europe can weather constitution refusal politicians have warned the french that voting down the eu constitution would push the eu into a period of introspection and even lead to the collapse of the union .
other observers say it 's not as bad as all that .
-lrb- may 27 , 2004 -rrb- analysts : france may blow eu constitution a poll published in france on friday showed that 51 percent of french voters could vote " no " in a referendum on the european constitution .
a rejection by the french could kill the treaty .
-lrb- march 19 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2005 dossier : france and the eu 's future when the heads of the eu 's member states signed their names to the proposed constitution in october 2004 , they knew they would have a hard time convincing the union 's 450 million people to accept it .
they agreed the british would be skeptical and that it would be difficult to persuade poland to vote for the document , but few expected they would have to go to such great lengths to get france to sign off on the document .
the 448-article constitution has divided france , sometimes bitterly .
even the french socialists , once thought to be firmly behind the constitution , are split into two camps .
supporters say the proposed treaty would give france more international influence while making the eu more democratic and transparent .
the other side maintains that the constitution abandons france 's social welfare model for a free-wheeling , us-style free-market system .
opponents also argue it gives too much power to brussels .
the " yes " camp started ahead , but domestic troubles in france have given the " no " side a clear and stable lead in the campaign 's final weeks .
still , up to 20 percent of french voters say they are still undecided or willing to change their minds .
dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution . dw-world.de chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution president jacques chirac has made a last televised plea to the french people urging them to vote in favor of the european constitution on sunday .
but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles .
-lrb- may 27 , 2005 -rrb- expected french ' non ' hits euro the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .
but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls .
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- courting the constitution europe is no leader in the game of creating hot gossip but the constitution sure has the continent chattering .
the question is , does anyone really know what their tongues are wagging about ?
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .
-lrb- april 2 , 2005 -rrb- europe can weather constitution refusal politicians have warned the french that voting down the eu constitution would push the eu into a period of introspection and even lead to the collapse of the union .
other observers say it 's not as bad as all that .
-lrb- may 27 , 2004 -rrb- analysts : france may blow eu constitution a poll published in france on friday showed that 51 percent of french voters could vote " no " in a referendum on the european constitution .
a rejection by the french could kill the treaty .
-lrb- march 19 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .

the commission said that the new immigration law needs to abolish this status with refugees more easily able to receive a residency permit . since january , when the law came into effect , the federal immigration agency hardly grants any permanent residency permits anymore and is extending the temporary ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marieluise beck " the fact that this kettenduldung has not been done away with is inconsistent and shows the true intention of lawmakers , " said marielouise beck , the federal government 's migration commissioner . immigration policy needs rethinking volker beck , a green party member of parliament , blamed german interior minister otto schilly for this , saying that his bureaucracy that has successfully " boycotted " the humanitarian implementation of the law . immigration experts also urged a rethinking of policies to better reflect the realities of immigration and cultural diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily persented the migration commission 's first report last october " the integration of foreigners in germany must be , in the future , more than just paper pushing over where and how they are to live , " said marieluise beck .
these days , every fourth newborn in germany has a foreign parent , making the debates over a multicultural society rather superfluous , she added . " schools , hospitals , old-age homes , the workplace , they all must be in the position to be able to deal with diversity and must open themselves to it , " she said . need more integration courses representatives also took issue over the integration courses that were introduced for foreigners in january : there is more interest than available slots , beck said . according to the new law , each immigrant has the right to take part in such a course .
at the same time , foreigners who do n't take the course or who drop out can expect sanctions .
beck and her colleagues say that the government needs to create more of these courses .
the government has allotted about 264 million euros -lrb- $ 331 million -rrb- annually for the classes . another complaint was the failure of the government to address naturalization issues , particularly one affecting young turkish men .
in this case , their naturalization is hampered because of the compulsory military service demanded by turkey , representatives said .

but according to consumer protection officials , that 's what makes them all the more dangerous , since the powder inside contains alcohol , and a lot of it - about 4.8 percent by volume .
that is the equivalent of one to one-and-a-half glasses of liquor . the product is called subyou , manufactured by a company in north rhine-westphalia , and is marketed squarely at teenagers with slogans like " taste for not much dough " and " gets a good buzz going . "
add the powder to cold water , and consumers have an alcoholic drink containing either vodka or rum . " these are just as dangerous as the alcopops that came in the bottles , " birgit rehlender , nutrition expert at consumer affairs organization stiftung warentest told der spiegel weekly . tax exempt while authorities were able to curtail the consumption of alcopops with a special tax on the drinks last august - which put them out of the reach of many teenage budgets - these new alcopops in powder form cost between 1.65 and 2.40 euros -lrb- $ 2.06 and $ 3.00 -rrb- per package .
subyou is able to get around the tax because its product comes in powder form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the little packets that pack a wallop the powder was first sold over the internet , and word spread quickly among teenage circles that those under 18 could order off the internet without fear of being asked for proof of age .
however , according to andrea schauff , a nutritional expert at hesse 's consumer protection organization , in many stores the powder is being sold to under-age kids even though a warning is printed on the packets : " alcohol can be addictive - no sales to minors . " besides the high alcohol content , youth advocates also worry about the powder 's other ingredients , including high levels of preservatives , sorbic acid , and dyes that have not been approved by health experts . consumer protection authorities , such as waltraud fesser from rhineland-palatinate , would like to see the special tax on liquid alcopops be applied to their cousins in powder form .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2005 dossier : france and the eu 's future when the heads of the eu 's member states signed their names to the proposed constitution in october 2004 , they knew they would have a hard time convincing the union 's 450 million people to accept it .
they agreed the british would be skeptical and that it would be difficult to persuade poland to vote for the document , but few expected they would have to go to such great lengths to get france to sign off on the document .
the 448-article constitution has divided france , sometimes bitterly .
even the french socialists , once thought to be firmly behind the constitution , are split into two camps .
supporters say the proposed treaty would give france more international influence while making the eu more democratic and transparent .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , who led the constitution draft committee , used a speech in the bundesrat to issue a last-ditch appeal to his countrymen .
" the day after tomorrow , i hope with all my heart , the french will in their turn ratify the constitution in a referendum , " he said .
a " milestone " for europe bundesrat president matthias platzeck called the constitution a " milestone " in european development that would increase the union 's international influence as well as make it a more democratic and transparent .
though the necessary two-thirds approval in germany was never in question , mecklenburg-vorpommern abstained from the roll call .
the state held backs its vote because ruling coalition of social democrats and party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , could not reach a common position .
earlier this month a poll from infratest dimap showed that 59 percent of germans would have voted for the treaty , had the been given the chance as another study from omniquest showed 77 percent of them wished they could .
now the constitution only needs to be signed by german president horst köhler before it becomes binding .

but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles . chirac 's appeal came as a " no " vote looked more and more likely , the latest opinion polls give the treaty ’ s opponents 55 percent .
the president called the proposed constitution vital to france 's future and implored voters not to use the trip to the polls as a chance to vote against his government .
thursday 's primetime broadcast , which was carried by all the main channels , was the french president 's final chance .
even though he went on tv urging for a " yes , " it was his opponents who gained momentum , giving them a 10-point lead two days ahead of the referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac tried to outline the constitution 's advantages thursday night " europeans would perceive a rejection of the treaty as a ' no ' to europe , " chirac said , hoping to influence the 20 percent of voters who remain undecided or said they may change their mind before voting .
" it would open a period of divisions , doubts , uncertainties . "
he went on to list the advantages the treaty held for france as he saw it : a more powerful voice in europe with stronger voting rights and protection of the traditional french social economic model .
opponents increase lead the problem for the president and all the other " yes " campaigners is that these arguments have had no lasting impact .
even efforts by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german chancellor gerhard schröder , who are due in france late friday , to lend a helping hand to the stumbling " yes " bid may come too late as the " no " camp remains stubbornly ahead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president has had plenty of help from abroad .
he 's pictured here with polish president aleksander kwasniewski , right , and german chancellor gerhard schröder , center as french unemployment hovers at 10 percent and chirac 's approval rating at 39 percent , the referendum is largely seen as much more of a plebiscite for his government than a decision on the constitution itself .
' ' we must not mistake the question , " chirac said .
' ' it is not about saying ' yes ' or ' no ' to the government .
it is about your future , that of your children , of the future of france and the future of europe . "
though it may be too little too late , chirac hinted that he would shake up his team in the event of a negative vote by promising to bring a " new impetus " to his team .
though he ruled out his own resignation , some expect to see france 's most popular right-wing politician , nicolas sarkozy , taking over for current prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
a second referendum ?
resigned to the fact that the french as well as the dutch , who vote on the constitution june 1 , will in all likelihood cast the 448-article document aside , politicians have already begun making arrangements on ways of salvaging the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin while raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- has already ruled out repeating the referendum , others believe there 's a chance that the french will be asked to return to the ballot box a second time if the eu 's other member states ratify the constitution , which needs to be approved by all 25 eu members before going into effect .
calling the constitution " too valuable not to defend , " peter hintze , the german christian democrat opposition 's european affairs spokesman , told the financial times deutschland the french should " have a second try . "
italy 's foreign minister gianfranco fini also said he did n't believe a french non would be the end of the constitution .
" the heads of government should invite those countries which have not done so to ratify the treaty , to avoid the impression that the ' no ' of one country irreversibly ends up stopping the process for all of europe , " fini told la stampa newspaper friday .

trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie .

he said germany is experiencing a perceptible return to traditional family values in which youngsters are not only willing to wait for a serious relationship before having sex , but in which they have begun looking to the church - and its intrinsic values - as a point of orientation for their lives . but peschel rejected such claims as unsubstantiated .

trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie .

" because of that , they are looking for a vision which includes security , a relationship and family . " trend analyst retzbach says the desire for the family idyll of spouse , children and a house with a garden has been gaining ground over recent years .
he said germany is experiencing a perceptible return to traditional family values in which youngsters are not only willing to wait for a serious relationship before having sex , but in which they have begun looking to the church - and its intrinsic values - as a point of orientation for their lives . but peschel rejected such claims as unsubstantiated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : france and the eu 's future expected french ' non ' hits euro courting the constitution french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back europe -pipe- 27.05.2005 chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp added to its lead after chirac 's appeal president jacques chirac has made a last televised plea to the french people urging them to vote in favor of the european constitution on sunday .
but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles . chirac 's appeal came as a " no " vote looked more and more likely , the latest opinion polls give the treaty ’ s opponents 55 percent .
the president called the proposed constitution vital to france 's future and implored voters not to use the trip to the polls as a chance to vote against his government .
thursday 's primetime broadcast , which was carried by all the main channels , was the french president 's final chance .
even though he went on tv urging for a " yes , " it was his opponents who gained momentum , giving them a 10-point lead two days ahead of the referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac tried to outline the constitution 's advantages thursday night " europeans would perceive a rejection of the treaty as a ' no ' to europe , " chirac said , hoping to influence the 20 percent of voters who remain undecided or said they may change their mind before voting .
" it would open a period of divisions , doubts , uncertainties . "
he went on to list the advantages the treaty held for france as he saw it : a more powerful voice in europe with stronger voting rights and protection of the traditional french social economic model .
opponents increase lead the problem for the president and all the other " yes " campaigners is that these arguments have had no lasting impact .
even efforts by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german chancellor gerhard schröder , who are due in france late friday , to lend a helping hand to the stumbling " yes " bid may come too late as the " no " camp remains stubbornly ahead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president has had plenty of help from abroad .
he 's pictured here with polish president aleksander kwasniewski , right , and german chancellor gerhard schröder , center as french unemployment hovers at 10 percent and chirac 's approval rating at 39 percent , the referendum is largely seen as much more of a plebiscite for his government than a decision on the constitution itself .
' ' we must not mistake the question , " chirac said .

"
be afraid ... be very afraid .
not content with bugging the majority of people in the western world with its grindingly annoying phone ringtone , crazy frog is set to take the charts by storm thanks to a german dance act . what 's blue , annoying and anatomically incorrect ?
without spending much time debating the possibilities , many people who have been bombarded for months with adverts on television , ring tones on the bus and now invasive snippets on the radio will soon come to the answer : crazy frog . more than just a passing fad , the evil love-child of an unholy union between some very bored swedes and a german dance act is set to become britain 's first ringtone inspired chart topper . when the polls come in on bbc radio one 's chart show on sunday , it is likely that crazy frog will beat the new and hugely anticipated single from rock group coldplay to the coveted top slot . bored swedes with too much time on their hands the manic animated amphibian which began its ascent to the top of the music charts on the back of a phone jingle was spawned seven years ago by daniel malmedahl , a computer salesman from gothenburg .
malmedahl , who has a ' talent ' for replicating every day noises , recorded his impression of a friends ' motorbike on his computer as a joke . that joke ended up on the internet where fellow swede erik wernquist , a designer of 3-d graphics , decided to build a character to fit the excruciating sound .
crazy frog was born . unfortunately , the blue frog with a belly-button , 1950s style crash helmet and human genitalia -lrb- which are blocked out on british tv due to complaints by the advertising standards authority -rrb- did n't die a death as a junk mail joke destined for the trash can of internet history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids just ca n't get enough of the crazy frog while adults ca n't stand it !
instead , it was picked up by ring tone company jamster and flogged mercilessly and relentlessly across all mediums .
to date , jamster has made more than 13 million euros -lrb- about $ 16 million -rrb- from people downloading crazy frog ringtones . german dance act with something against music but it has n't stopped there .
not content with hearing what resembles a skoda on its last legs trying to pick up speed in every bus , train and public place courtesy of mobile phones , jamster is set to make another fortune thanks to german dance act bass bumpers who have combined the flatulent-sounding frog with the theme from beverly hills cop for an assault on the music industry . the cd is apparently outselling british band coldplay 's new single " speed of sound " by more than four to one with an estimated 400,000 copies of crazy frog already on order across the uk , according to the label gut records who is distributing the ' musical ' monstrosity . the frog is big business and with a number one single under its helmet , the anthropomorphic amphibian is expected to be just the first of a number of painful phone tie-ins which make it into the charts . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danger : exploding toads the residents of hamburg have been told to avoid one of the city 's lakes after a spate of mysterious explosions in the area .

their 28 , mainly male employees are currently the envy of working parents around the country .
schönberger stahlbau & metalltechnik has just beaten 366 rivals to scoop a family-friendly business award , presented in berlin tuesday by chancellor gerhard schröder and family minister renate schmidt . the prize in the medium-sized business category went to it company komsa , which boasts an executive department that 's 41 percent female - many of whom are mothers working part-time .
germany-based detergent and cosmetics giant henkel was named the most family-friendly multinational company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time away from work is important all three companies are profitable proof that catering to family needs is good for business - and therefore good for germany . " -lrb- family-friendly policy -rrb- is a prerequisite of economic success , " schröder said . making parents ' lives easier the schönbergers could n't agree more . flanking the chancellor at the recent ceremony , they emphasized their belief in facilitating the work-life balance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schönbergers encourage employees to accompany children on their first day of school " our staff are allowed to take the day off for private celebrations , " said sabine schönberger .
" whether it 's a child 's birthday , first day of school or kindergarten , or communion , we actively persuade them to be there - we more or less force them .
they get a paid day off .
we also have no problem with employees bringing their children to work with them .
we give staff three months when their partners are expecting , and we make sure they are n't sent to construction sites too far away .
we expect our staff to take an active part in their family lives . " it 's all music to minister schmidt 's ears .
encouraging business to make working parents ' lives easier has long topped her family policy agenda . " children and parents need time for one another , " she said tuesday .
" this is a responsibility of our economy .
it 's not about changing laws , it 's about being willing to actually follow through on existing laws . " election campaign issue schröder has even pledged to put the issue at the heart of his upcoming election campaign .
he drew attention to a survey conducted by opinion research institute prognos that shows that adopting family-friendly policies can earn companies increased profits of up to 25 percent - thanks to a workforce that 's better rested , better motivated and more productive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man checks detergent bottles at a henkel plant " the family issue has developed into an economic issue , " schröder said .
" it 's becoming increasingly apparent that healthy family policy and sustainable economic growth are two sides of the same coin . " but the path to a gentler germany is still strewn with obstacles .
many employees still complain that large-scale companies insist on inflexible working hours impossible to reconcile with family demands , as well as a widespread absence of in-house childcare . sabine and andrea schönberger from bavaria could teach their colleagues across the nation a thing or two about family-friendly business models .
for now , they 're still an exception to the rule . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

that is similar to the mood seven years ago when helmut kohl lost his bid for a fifth term , when 64 percent of the electorate said it was time for a change . however , in a similar poll carried out by tns infratest for der spiegel news magazine , 41 percent said they would vote for schröder as opposed to 37 percent for merkel .
however , if parliamentary elections were held this weekend , schröder 's spd would get only 29 percent of the vote .
merkel 's union bloc would get 47 percent . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 after his social democratic party suffered defeat in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 , german chancellor gerhard schröder announced he wanted early elections to put his reform course before voters .

public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?
-lrb- may 23 , 2005 -rrb- a madam chancellor for germany ?
after years of working toward her goal , angela merkel is just a technicality away from running for germany 's highest office .
which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ?

but rejection may not mean the end of all the draft 's 448 articles . chirac 's appeal came as a " no " vote looked more and more likely , the latest opinion polls give the treaty ’ s opponents 55 percent .
the president called the proposed constitution vital to france 's future and implored voters not to use the trip to the polls as a chance to vote against his government .
thursday 's primetime broadcast , which was carried by all the main channels , was the french president 's final chance .
even though he went on tv urging for a " yes , " it was his opponents who gained momentum , giving them a 10-point lead two days ahead of the referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac tried to outline the constitution 's advantages thursday night " europeans would perceive a rejection of the treaty as a ' no ' to europe , " chirac said , hoping to influence the 20 percent of voters who remain undecided or said they may change their mind before voting .
" it would open a period of divisions , doubts , uncertainties . "
he went on to list the advantages the treaty held for france as he saw it : a more powerful voice in europe with stronger voting rights and protection of the traditional french social economic model .
opponents increase lead the problem for the president and all the other " yes " campaigners is that these arguments have had no lasting impact .
even efforts by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german chancellor gerhard schröder , who are due in france late friday , to lend a helping hand to the stumbling " yes " bid may come too late as the " no " camp remains stubbornly ahead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french president has had plenty of help from abroad .
he 's pictured here with polish president aleksander kwasniewski , right , and german chancellor gerhard schröder , center as french unemployment hovers at 10 percent and chirac 's approval rating at 39 percent , the referendum is largely seen as much more of a plebiscite for his government than a decision on the constitution itself .
' ' we must not mistake the question , " chirac said .
' ' it is not about saying ' yes ' or ' no ' to the government .
it is about your future , that of your children , of the future of france and the future of europe . "
though it may be too little too late , chirac hinted that he would shake up his team in the event of a negative vote by promising to bring a " new impetus " to his team .
though he ruled out his own resignation , some expect to see france 's most popular right-wing politician , nicolas sarkozy , taking over for current prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
a second referendum ?
resigned to the fact that the french as well as the dutch , who vote on the constitution june 1 , will in all likelihood cast the 448-article document aside , politicians have already begun making arrangements on ways of salvaging the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin while raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- has already ruled out repeating the referendum , others believe there 's a chance that the french will be asked to return to the ballot box a second time if the eu 's other member states ratify the constitution , which needs to be approved by all 25 eu members before going into effect .
calling the constitution " too valuable not to defend , " peter hintze , the german christian democrat opposition 's european affairs spokesman , told the financial times deutschland the french should " have a second try . "
italy 's foreign minister gianfranco fini also said he did n't believe a french non would be the end of the constitution .
" the heads of government should invite those countries which have not done so to ratify the treaty , to avoid the impression that the ' no ' of one country irreversibly ends up stopping the process for all of europe , " fini told la stampa newspaper friday .

though it may be too little too late , chirac hinted that he would shake up his team in the event of a negative vote by promising to bring a " new impetus " to his team .

but according to consumer protection officials , that 's what makes them all the more dangerous , since the powder inside contains alcohol , and a lot of it - about 4.8 percent by volume .
that is the equivalent of one to one-and-a-half glasses of liquor . the product is called subyou , manufactured by a company in north rhine-westphalia , and is marketed squarely at teenagers with slogans like " taste for not much dough " and " gets a good buzz going . "
add the powder to cold water , and consumers have an alcoholic drink containing either vodka or rum . " these are just as dangerous as the alcopops that came in the bottles , " birgit rehlender , nutrition expert at consumer affairs organization stiftung warentest told der spiegel weekly . tax exempt while authorities were able to curtail the consumption of alcopops with a special tax on the drinks last august - which put them out of the reach of many teenage budgets - these new alcopops in powder form cost between 1.65 and 2.40 euros -lrb- $ 2.06 and $ 3.00 -rrb- per package .
subyou is able to get around the tax because its product comes in powder form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the little packets that pack a wallop the powder was first sold over the internet , and word spread quickly among teenage circles that those under 18 could order off the internet without fear of being asked for proof of age .
however , according to andrea schauff , a nutritional expert at hesse 's consumer protection organization , in many stores the powder is being sold to under-age kids even though a warning is printed on the packets : " alcohol can be addictive - no sales to minors . " besides the high alcohol content , youth advocates also worry about the powder 's other ingredients , including high levels of preservatives , sorbic acid , and dyes that have not been approved by health experts . consumer protection authorities , such as waltraud fesser from rhineland-palatinate , would like to see the special tax on liquid alcopops be applied to their cousins in powder form .

but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ? politically at least , germany does indeed appear to be in the midst of a shift back to the right , although there are plenty who argue that it is not so much the conservative christian democrats who are rising in popularity as the left-of-center social democrats who have fallen out of favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany governed by conservatives - in black but this generation of young germans has a decided lack of interest in the political issues of their society , and are much more interested in themselves than anything else .
while that might seem like a given for adolescents and their seniors in some countries , it seems that this burgeoning bent towards self-centered behavior is news for germany . loud are the cries that youngsters up and down the country are displaying signs of the very conservative values their emancipated parents educated them against .
trend researcher and analyst roman retzbach said there is every reason to suggest that germany is rekindling its relationship with the bourgeoisie . " we have seen a shift from an educated society to what one might politely call a " taste society , " in which it is no longer important to know about schiller , but to be eating and wearing the right things , " retzbach said . chasing the mainstream granted there is now a movement away from the post-materialist values which have stood germany in good stead over the past three decades , such as interest in the environment , politics and the nation 's favorite ideologies . but klaus boehnke , professor of social science methodology , said that rather than slipping back into the ways of their grandparents , young people are simply evolving in keeping with society . bildunterschrift : clothes count for young germans " what we see now has a lot to do with german unification .

" young people see that their parents have to move because of work , and they see how rare it is to get a job for life , " he said .
" because of that , they are looking for a vision which includes security , a relationship and family . " trend analyst retzbach says the desire for the family idyll of spouse , children and a house with a garden has been gaining ground over recent years .
he said germany is experiencing a perceptible return to traditional family values in which youngsters are not only willing to wait for a serious relationship before having sex , but in which they have begun looking to the church - and its intrinsic values - as a point of orientation for their lives . but peschel rejected such claims as unsubstantiated . " the idea that young germans have become sexually prudent is nothing more than a peripheral phenomenon which has been given a mainstream focus by the media , " he said . " the majority of young people behave exactly the same as youngsters 20 years ago .

but the jail commander said no credible evidence had been found that the book had been flushed down a toilet .
the denial follows similar allegations against us guards in a 2002 document made public on wednesday , in which an fbi agent quoted an inmate .
newsweek also reported the toilet claim , but later retracted it .
the newsweek report sparked protests across the muslim world .
in afghanistan riots resulted in the deaths of at least 15 people .
the magazine withdrew its story after saying it could no longer corroborate the report .
the white house rounded on the magazine , saying its report had done " lasting damage " to the us image in the muslim world .
deliberate and accidental the guantanamo bay prison commander , brigadier general jay hood , said he had found that the koran had been mishandled on five occasions since late 2001 .
three of the cases appeared to involve deliberate mishandling , while the other two incidents were apparently accidental , he said .
four cases involved guards and one an interrogator .
brig gen hood said those involved had not violated the rules in place at the time .
the inmate who made the original allegation about the koran being flushed down the toilet had retracted it , he said .
a pentagon spokesman characterised the incidents as mainly inadvertent handling of the muslim holy book .
more than 500 people are being held at guantanamo bay , the us naval base on cuba , suspected of links to the al-qaeda network .
some have been detained for more than three years , but have not been charged .

the closure of tir john means that the city 's waste will be dumped at trecatty near merthyr tydfil and withyhedge in pembrokeshire .
to minimise what is transferred , people are being urged to re-double their efforts to recycle every item they can .
swansea council is launching new schemes to achieve this aim .
according to the council , it is people in their 20s and 30s that could be doing more to reduce what goes into landfill . "
if you cut down on what you bring home in the first place you cut down on what you throw out " owain griffiths since last july , a kerbside recycling scheme has been running across swansea with cans , paper and glass collected every other week from outside homes .
it has helped the proportion of domestic waste that is recycled rise from 5.2 % in 2000 to 22.2 % , or 31,000 tonnes , now .
waste minimisation officer owain griffiths estimated that if everyone in the city used the recycling scheme the figure would rise to nearly 40 % .
" there are three basic types of people , " he said .
" there are 30 % who will recycle no matter what , 30 % who will never recycle and that 's the same throughout most of europe and 40 % who will , provided it 's made easy for them , provided they are told what to do and when to do it . "
he said almost every primary school in swansea had been pushing the recycling message for some time and people in their later years were also generally good .
" it 's the younger people who say they do n't have the time , " said mr griffiths .
in a bid to get more people on board , the council put a £ 500 prize draw to get students to use the kerbside scheme , groups and organisations are paid for recycling cans and a green waste collection trial for garden waste will be tested on 35,000 homes .
by 2010 the welsh assembly government has told every local authority it must recycle 40 % of domestic waste .
in the same year the national audit office for wales has warned wales may run out of places to tip .
the next big step in swansea will be the opening of an in-vessel composter which will turn the city 's kitchen waste , currently destined for landfill , into compost .

the closure of tir john means that the city 's waste will be dumped at trecatty near merthyr tydfil and withyhedge in pembrokeshire .
to minimise what is transferred , people are being urged to re-double their efforts to recycle every item they can .
swansea council is launching new schemes to achieve this aim .
according to the council , it is people in their 20s and 30s that could be doing more to reduce what goes into landfill .
if you cut down on what you bring home in the first place you cut down on what you throw out owain griffiths since last july , a kerbside recycling scheme has been running across swansea with cans , paper and glass collected every other week from outside homes .
it has helped the proportion of domestic waste that is recycled rise from 5.2 % in 2000 to 22.2 % , or 31,000 tonnes , now .
waste minimisation officer owain griffiths estimated that if everyone in the city used the recycling scheme the figure would rise to nearly 40 % .
" there are three basic types of people , " he said .
" there are 30 % who will recycle no matter what , 30 % who will never recycle and that 's the same throughout most of europe and 40 % who will , provided it 's made easy for them , provided they are told what to do and when to do it . "
he said almost every primary school in swansea had been pushing the recycling message for some time and people in their later years were also generally good .
tir john closes on saturday 4 june because it is full " it 's the younger people who say they do n't have the time , " said mr griffiths .
in a bid to get more people on board , the council put a £ 500 prize draw to get students to use the kerbside scheme , groups and organisations are paid for recycling cans and a green waste collection trial for garden waste will be tested on 35,000 homes .
by 2010 the welsh assembly government has told every local authority it must recycle 40 % of domestic waste .
in the same year the national audit office for wales has warned wales may run out of places to tip .
the next big step in swansea will be the opening of an in-vessel composter which will turn the city 's kitchen waste , currently destined for landfill , into compost .
there will also be a drive towards waste minimisation - measures such as encouraging shoppers to re-use their plastic shopping bags and making conscious decisions to buy products with less packaging .
" if you cut down on what you bring home in the first place you cut down on what you throw out , " added griffiths .

administrator pricewaterhousecoopers has sent documents to creditors showing that it has received claims for more than £ 1.37bn -lrb- $ 2.5bn -rrb- .
the administrator could have assets of only £ 80.5m after preferred creditors and secured bank loans are paid .
the administrator 's own costs could also make a " substantial " dent .
the financial times estimates that " companies owed money by mg rover are likely to be paid a maximum of 5p in the pound " , while reuters quotes a source close to the situation who says they may struggle to get 1 % .
jon bunn , a spokesman for pwc confirmed it had produced a report for creditors , but said it did not include calculations on what they would receive .
" until we know how much money we 're going to get from selling rover assets , it is impossible to say how much creditors will get in the pound , " said jon bunn , a spokesman for pricewaterhousecoopers .
he added that pwc would hold a meeting for creditors on 10 june in birmingham .
unanswered questions the report for creditors covers only mg rover , not its sister company powertrain .
it shows that rover was losing £ 25m a month before it went into administration in april and that its former owner phoenix venture holdings is its largest creditor .
on thursday , the financial reporting council , a corporate reporting and governance watchdog , said its investigation of rover 's published accounts to the end of 2003 had raised a " number of questions " .
mg rover 's creditors include the network of dealers , former owner phoenix venture holdings , the vat man , pension funds and bmw .

the heads of the 12 leading firms say climate change is a huge challenge that needs serious investment by business .
but they say they can not invest because they are not sure what future government policies on climate will be .
the letter is signed off by the heads of bp , shell , hsbc bank , baa , john lewis , scottish power and more .
between them the firms employ tens of thousands of people and have a turnover of £ 452bn .
catch 22 the letter has been arranged through the prince of wales business and environment programme .
the business leaders say they are very concerned about the prospect of dangerous climate change and support the government 's target of reducing co2 emissions by 60 % by 2050 .
they regret that industry and government are currently caught in a catch 22 .
governments are nervous of clamping down on climate change emissions for fear of a backlash from business .
the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- successfully lobbied against proposed cuts last year .
they said the measure would harm british business .
the department of trade and industry and the prime minister have so far been backing the position of the cbi .
but in their letter the business leaders say they believe emissions cuts of 60 % can be achieved in the uk without damaging competitiveness if firms use energy more wisely and harness new technology .
' boost profits ' they believe measures to hold co2 emissions to a safe level would reduce economic growth by no more than 2 % by 2050 .
they say bold policy action could actually boost britain 's profits by making the uk a world leader in low carbon technology .
the group say some of the technologies to achieve this goal already exist but need to be developed .
some are yet to be invented .
they point to a study showing that even if the uk starts seriously developing the market for zero emissions cars now , total emissions from cars will not start to fall until 2040 .
the business leaders demand that the government establishes a long-term value for carbon emissions reductions and consistently supports and provides incentives for the development of new technologies .
they say the prime minister 's presidency this year of both g8 and the eu offers an historic opportunity for a breakthrough on climate .
at home the group say the government should eliminate contradictory policies that lead to increase in co2 - such as out of town developments .
they say ministers should make sure no new policies on any topic will fuel climate change .

the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- successfully lobbied against proposed cuts last year .
they said the measure would harm british business .
the department of trade and industry and the prime minister have so far been backing the position of the cbi .
but in their letter the business leaders say they believe emissions cuts of 60 % can be achieved in the uk without damaging competitiveness if firms use energy more wisely and harness new technology .
' boost profits ' they believe measures to hold co2 emissions to a safe level would reduce economic growth by no more than 2 % by 2050 .
they say bold policy action could actually boost britain 's profits by making the uk a world leader in low carbon technology .
the group say some of the technologies to achieve this goal already exist but need to be developed .
some are yet to be invented .
they point to a study showing that even if the uk starts seriously developing the market for zero emissions cars now , total emissions from cars will not start to fall until 2040 .
the business leaders demand that the government establishes a long-term value for carbon emissions reductions and consistently supports and provides incentives for the development of new technologies .
they say the prime minister 's presidency this year of both g8 and the eu offers an historic opportunity for a breakthrough on climate .
at home the group say the government should eliminate contradictory policies that lead to increase in co2 - such as out of town developments .
they say ministers should make sure no new policies on any topic will fuel climate change .

the guide was organised by the marine conservation society -lrb- mcs -rrb- , which looked at water quality .
the mcs recommended sand bay , brean , dunster north west and south east and porlock weir .
no beaches failed the test , although nine were not monitored .
blue anchor west moved up from a fail in 2004 , to a basic pass this year .
the number of beaches doubled across the uk as a whole that failed the european water quality tests ; a total of 52 .
the mcs said it would not advise swimming at these beaches as infections such as gastroenteritis were more likely .
it blames last year 's wet summer for an increase in pollution .
the number of mcs-recommended beaches also fell .
