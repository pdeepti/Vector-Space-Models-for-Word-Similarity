1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold .

that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .

according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .

" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .
" the eu will only strike an agreement on its future financing if all sides are willing to be flexible at this pivotal summit , " he said thursday . tired of being paymaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany wants an agreement .
but it is clear that it will only be possible if everyone moves , " schröder said on arrival at the metting which is deadlocked over the 2007-2013 budget plans " but whether that is possible is an open question , " he added . the negotiations are blocked by britain 's refusal to abandon its cherished european union budget rebate , although there is also fierce disagreement over overall contribution levels . germany is the biggest net contributor to the european union 's roughly $ 100-billion-a-year budget .
but with its public finances already very tight , berlin appears increasingly weary of its role as europe 's paymaster , especially since the 2007-2013 spending proposals would suck billions more out of its budget . britain takes the rap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before heading to brussels , the chancellor took aim at britain 's eu budget rebate , secured by former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid .
britain is strongly against luxembourg 's proposal to freeze it in 2007 and later " set it on a downward path . " " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " schröder said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . "
but opposition leader angela merkel , on course to challenge schröder if elections are held in september , voiced some support for prime minister blair .
" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .
for now , more than 40 percent of the overall budget is spent on the common agricultural policy , with france the biggest recipient of farm funds . gearing up for a fight swedish prime minister goran persson weighed in friday saying he thought it was unlikely a deal on the budget would be reached in one day , and pointed out the eu still had a year to sort out its differences .
" i 'm still very pessimistic and i think we should not rush into a deal today , " he told reporters .
" we all hope there will be a deal but it 's better to take a year more and negotiate , " he said , adding there was a need to re-examine the balance between eu farm and regional aid . jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president said he was ready for a fight .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .
" the eu will only strike an agreement on its future financing if all sides are willing to be flexible at this pivotal summit , " he said thursday . tired of being paymaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany wants an agreement .
but it is clear that it will only be possible if everyone moves , " schröder said on arrival at the metting which is deadlocked over the 2007-2013 budget plans " but whether that is possible is an open question , " he added . the negotiations are blocked by britain 's refusal to abandon its cherished european union budget rebate , although there is also fierce disagreement over overall contribution levels . germany is the biggest net contributor to the european union 's roughly $ 100-billion-a-year budget .
but with its public finances already very tight , berlin appears increasingly weary of its role as europe 's paymaster , especially since the 2007-2013 spending proposals would suck billions more out of its budget . britain takes the rap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before heading to brussels , the chancellor took aim at britain 's eu budget rebate , secured by former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid .
britain is strongly against luxembourg 's proposal to freeze it in 2007 and later " set it on a downward path . " " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " schröder said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . "
but opposition leader angela merkel , on course to challenge schröder if elections are held in september , voiced some support for prime minister blair .
" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .
for now , more than 40 percent of the overall budget is spent on the common agricultural policy , with france the biggest recipient of farm funds . gearing up for a fight swedish prime minister goran persson weighed in friday saying he thought it was unlikely a deal on the budget would be reached in one day , and pointed out the eu still had a year to sort out its differences .
" i 'm still very pessimistic and i think we should not rush into a deal today , " he told reporters .
" we all hope there will be a deal but it 's better to take a year more and negotiate , " he said , adding there was a need to re-examine the balance between eu farm and regional aid . jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president said he was ready for a fight .
" i predict a day of many battle , and i 'm going to be in shape , " he warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wrangling could carry over into an unscheduled session on saturday , if leaders decide a deal is within their grasp after all . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution gets time for reflection late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .
while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .
it is his second home , one that compels him and to which he has dedicated a love song with his latest film . petra tabeling -lrb- win -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german film flexes its muscles in cannes as cannes gears up for its 58th film festival , germany is breathing a sigh of relief that after years banished to the celluloid wilderness , its film industry is well-represented for the second year running .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .
it is his second home , one that compels him and to which he has dedicated a love song with his latest film . petra tabeling -lrb- win -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german film flexes its muscles in cannes as cannes gears up for its 58th film festival , germany is breathing a sigh of relief that after years banished to the celluloid wilderness , its film industry is well-represented for the second year running .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 eu leaders deadlocked on budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's juncker did what he could , but it was n't enough despite a last-ditch bid friday to break a deadlock between britain and france over future eu financing , the uk rejected a french concession on an eu rebate , preventing the bloc from agreeing on a 2007 - 2013 budget . current eu president , prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg , called tony blair and several other eu leaders into a crisis meeting late in the day to make a final offer in order to secure an agreement for the budget .
but according to british government spokesperson , the uk rejected the offer . in refusing the offer , britain said any change must be linked to reform of the bloc 's farm subsidies program . " it 's clear that what the presidency is proposing does n't clearly establish that link between any change to the rebate and reform of the budget , and the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- in particular , " prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said . speaking after blair had a private meeting withjuncker , he said the plan also contained an unacceptable request for additional funds from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands , which has also wanted to reform the eu budgetary process , and lower its per capita contributions , also said it was n't ready to accept an offer from juncker of a contribution relief package of some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 860 million -rrb- .
after the decisive dutch ' no ' vote on the eu constitution , prime minister jan peter balkenende -lrb- photo -rrb- is under intense pressure at home to cut contribution levels significantly . compromise attempt earlier in the day , french president jacques chirac had made it known he would accept a freeze on the uk 's annual refund from eu coffers rather than the outright cut he sought if it helped clinch a package deal at the summit . at issue is the rebate britain receives every year from the eu budget , which was won in 1984 through the tough negotiation of then-prime minister margaret thatcher .
the rebate is worth 5.1 billion euros out of a 106.3 billion euro eu budget this year and is projected to rise to nearly eight billion euros by 2013 if the mechanism is not changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has said it will not accept any kind of change to the rebate agreement unless other eu expenditures , such as france 's large agricultural subsidies , are also reexamined .
france 's chirac has staunchly defended the agricultural subsides , but said earlier today he was ready to compromise . " a freeze is not enough , but if it is a compromise , like all compromises , we 'll have to accept that it does n't make everyone happy , " an aide to chirac told reporters . but a british official swiftly belittled the move . " graciously accepting an offer we rejected three days ago does n't do it for us , " a british official said .
" we do n't think it 's much of a concession .
it would mean us losing between 25 and 30 billion euros -lrb- over seven years -rrb- . " constitution in tatters europe 's grand plans for its first constitution lay in disarray in brussels on friday after eu leaders put the charter on hold for at least a year to win over deeply sceptical voters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the european union consigned the charter - crafted over four years as new ground rules for an expanded 25-nation alliance - to the deep freeze after devastating ballot reversals in france and the netherlands . they abandoned a november 2006 deadline for ratification of the constitution , and set no new date for its adoption .
the treaty must be ratified by every member state to come into legal effect .
eu leaders decided to come back and check the treaty 's pulse , but not for another year . " we all agreed to come back to the subject in june 2006 to make an overall evaluation of national debates and to see how best to proceed with the process of ratification , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said . still , most countries refused to declare the deal dead . " i do not think europe is in crisis , " said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we should not dramatize the situation because , for the constitution we have time , we will see .
but we have to explain it to our citizens . " is there hope ? but there has never been a clear answer as to how the treaty can overcome the french and dutch setbacks , even though it has been ratified by 10 member states .
the netherlands pronounced the last rites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" the dutch were very clear in their ' no ' and that 's why we as a governement said that we do n't see any chance for a second referendum , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai .
" it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty .

they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .
" but five years ago , we decided to go international for various reasons .
an infectious virus such as hiv ca n't be tackled at a local level only .
we ca n't build walls to contain it , and the spread of aids in africa , india and china inevitably affects us , too .

they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .
" but five years ago , we decided to go international for various reasons .

germany 's economy grew by one percent in the previous three months , the strongest rate in four years .

" although the domestic economy shows slight signs of stabilization , high oil prices seem to weigh on demand from abroad , " said the finance ministry in its june report .
the country 's leading economists are predicting growth of 0.7 percent for the entire year ; the government is targeting one percent growth . dw-world.de berlin cuts growth forecast , slams ecb the german government scaled back its 2005 growth forecasts on friday , saying its earlier prognosis had been too optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.06.2005 turkish music hits german cinemas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul 's modern face of music in his new film " crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul , " turkish-german director fatih akin embarks on a musical search for traditions .
the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .
it is his second home , one that compels him and to which he has dedicated a love song with his latest film . petra tabeling -lrb- win -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german film flexes its muscles in cannes as cannes gears up for its 58th film festival , germany is breathing a sigh of relief that after years banished to the celluloid wilderness , its film industry is well-represented for the second year running .

in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .

it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .
" the eu will only strike an agreement on its future financing if all sides are willing to be flexible at this pivotal summit , " he said thursday . tired of being paymaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany wants an agreement .
but it is clear that it will only be possible if everyone moves , " schröder said on arrival at the metting which is deadlocked over the 2007-2013 budget plans " but whether that is possible is an open question , " he added . the negotiations are blocked by britain 's refusal to abandon its cherished european union budget rebate , although there is also fierce disagreement over overall contribution levels . germany is the biggest net contributor to the european union 's roughly $ 100-billion-a-year budget .
but with its public finances already very tight , berlin appears increasingly weary of its role as europe 's paymaster , especially since the 2007-2013 spending proposals would suck billions more out of its budget . britain takes the rap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before heading to brussels , the chancellor took aim at britain 's eu budget rebate , secured by former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid .

" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .
for now , more than 40 percent of the overall budget is spent on the common agricultural policy , with france the biggest recipient of farm funds . gearing up for a fight swedish prime minister goran persson weighed in friday saying he thought it was unlikely a deal on the budget would be reached in one day , and pointed out the eu still had a year to sort out its differences .
" i 'm still very pessimistic and i think we should not rush into a deal today , " he told reporters .
" we all hope there will be a deal but it 's better to take a year more and negotiate , " he said , adding there was a need to re-examine the balance between eu farm and regional aid . jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president said he was ready for a fight .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .
" the eu will only strike an agreement on its future financing if all sides are willing to be flexible at this pivotal summit , " he said thursday . tired of being paymaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany wants an agreement .
but it is clear that it will only be possible if everyone moves , " schröder said on arrival at the metting which is deadlocked over the 2007-2013 budget plans " but whether that is possible is an open question , " he added . the negotiations are blocked by britain 's refusal to abandon its cherished european union budget rebate , although there is also fierce disagreement over overall contribution levels . germany is the biggest net contributor to the european union 's roughly $ 100-billion-a-year budget .
but with its public finances already very tight , berlin appears increasingly weary of its role as europe 's paymaster , especially since the 2007-2013 spending proposals would suck billions more out of its budget . britain takes the rap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before heading to brussels , the chancellor took aim at britain 's eu budget rebate , secured by former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid .
britain is strongly against luxembourg 's proposal to freeze it in 2007 and later " set it on a downward path . " " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " schröder said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . "

" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .
for now , more than 40 percent of the overall budget is spent on the common agricultural policy , with france the biggest recipient of farm funds . gearing up for a fight swedish prime minister goran persson weighed in friday saying he thought it was unlikely a deal on the budget would be reached in one day , and pointed out the eu still had a year to sort out its differences .
" i 'm still very pessimistic and i think we should not rush into a deal today , " he told reporters .
" we all hope there will be a deal but it 's better to take a year more and negotiate , " he said , adding there was a need to re-examine the balance between eu farm and regional aid . jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president said he was ready for a fight .

european papers largely condemned the move , saying it was an expression of weakness . le figaro in paris described the delay as surrealistic .
" technically this means that the constitution will be put on ice for a year and a half in order to avoid burying it , " the paper wrote .
" basically , british pragmatism has won : ' it 's better to take a long break than widen the crisis . " ' vienna 's kurier called the decision " politically irresponsible and dangerous .
europe can not afford a standstill .
it 's also unwise to continue the ratifcation process - that 's like asking people to vote on a dead body . " milan 's corriere della sera saw europe smashed to pieces : " the french and dutch ' no ' to the constitution have set off an avalanche and the conflict between french president chirac and british premier blair over eu finances has added a further crisis .
under different circumstances , a compromise could have been found .
but what would have been easy in a healthy eu is almost impossible now . " rzeczpospolita in warsaw thought that europe 's leaders were simply clueless about how to go on .
" six or 12 extra months wo n't change anything , " the paper wrote .
" we 're certainly at the beginning of a long crisis for integration . "
but the daily added that the current situation might turn out to be a positive thing for the eu .
" the union does n't have a choice any more .
it can deal with its problems , but only if it becomes a world power whose citizens completely identify with it . " the cellesche zeitung in northern germany wrote that halting the ratification process was a wise move .
" it certainly is n't a sign for integration when the shock is so big that the opinions of the other country get ignored , " the paper wrote .
" they have to feel like second-class eu members .
new negotiations should only commence once all countries have voted .
not earlier . " and writing about britain 's refusal to give up a decade-old budget rebate and instead calling for an overall budget reform , the times of london said germany 's main opposition christian democrat leader angela merkel was a " useful ally , " saying her support for reform had " shown more leadership than most of the prime ministers gathered around the table in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 ankara haunted by armenian massacre großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armenians honor the 1.5 million victims of turkish violence when the german parliament condemned the mass killing of armenians by turks 90 years ago , it sparked angry protest from ankara .
but if it wants to be taken seriously by the eu , it needs to face up to its past . in a vote thursday , germany 's main parliamentary parties joined forces to deplore the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians between 1915 and 1916 . berlin is now urging turkey to set up an independent committee of turkish , armenian and international historians to document what happened . the resolution looks set to test relations between ankara and berlin .
so far , the german government has been a key supporter of turkish eu aspirations . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul described the resolution as one-sided and " provocative , " and said german lawmakers had ignored repeated warnings of the harm the resolution would do to bilateral ties . time for reconciliation faruk sen is the director of the center for turkish studies in essen in germany .
he feels disapointed by the turkish foreign minister 's harsh criticism of the resolution , and says turkey has to look forward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 80,000 armenians live in turkey , " he told dw radio .
" each year , more than 100,000 come to turkey to work there .
it is time for reconciliation .
i think to look back on 90 years of history does n't help at all .
turkey and armenia need good relations today . " genocide ? turkey is worried that it will come under mounting pressure to recognize the killings as " genocide " after it starts eu entry talks in october .
other european nations , including poland and greece , have also passed resolutions condemning the genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac of france , home to europe 's largest armenian diaspora , said failure by turkey to recognize the genocide could harm the country 's eu bid . faruk sen , however , is critical of the eu 's stance . " if that 's the opinion of the eu , it is a shame , " he insisted .
" because then , turkey and the eu can not negotiate anymore .

but if it wants to be taken seriously by the eu , it needs to face up to its past . in a vote thursday , germany 's main parliamentary parties joined forces to deplore the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians between 1915 and 1916 . berlin is now urging turkey to set up an independent committee of turkish , armenian and international historians to document what happened . the resolution looks set to test relations between ankara and berlin .
so far , the german government has been a key supporter of turkish eu aspirations . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul described the resolution as one-sided and " provocative , " and said german lawmakers had ignored repeated warnings of the harm the resolution would do to bilateral ties . time for reconciliation faruk sen is the director of the center for turkish studies in essen in germany .
he feels disapointed by the turkish foreign minister 's harsh criticism of the resolution , and says turkey has to look forward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 80,000 armenians live in turkey , " he told dw radio .
" each year , more than 100,000 come to turkey to work there .
it is time for reconciliation .
i think to look back on 90 years of history does n't help at all .
turkey and armenia need good relations today . " genocide ? turkey is worried that it will come under mounting pressure to recognize the killings as " genocide " after it starts eu entry talks in october .
other european nations , including poland and greece , have also passed resolutions condemning the genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac of france , home to europe 's largest armenian diaspora , said failure by turkey to recognize the genocide could harm the country 's eu bid . faruk sen , however , is critical of the eu 's stance . " if that 's the opinion of the eu , it is a shame , " he insisted .
" because then , turkey and the eu can not negotiate anymore .
the eu would have to do without turkey . " turkey gets impatient the german resolution comes at a time when the eu is already displeased with turkey over its dragging human rights and judicial reform . faruk sen says the eu has tested turkey 's patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " people in turkey are increasingly against the eu and now the armenia debate has been added to turkey 's obligations to join the eu .
i think if the eu-membership fails because of the armenia-issue , the people in turkey wo n't be too sad . " turkey denies the claims that 1.5 million armenians were slaughtered in a systematic genocide between 1915 and 1923 as the multi-ethnic ottoman empire collapsed .
it accepts that hundreds of thousands of armenians were killed , but says even more turks died in a partisan conflict in which many armenians backed invading russian troops . ignorance and taboos but political theorist ahmet insel pointed out that the reason so many turks deny the extent of the massacre has nothing to do with nationalistic or racist sentiment - it 's simply ignorance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul residents , many of them new arrivals in this 10-million city which gets 200,000 migrants from the countryside annually , crowd a street lined with street vendors in downtown eminonu on may 19 , 1996 .
the united nations conference on world 's cities , habitat ii , will begin in istanbul on june 3 to discuss problems of cities like istanbul .
more than 20,000 people are expected to convene in istanbul for the summit , adding to its chaos on the streets and traffic jams .
-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- " generations of turks have grown up never learning about this tragedy , " he said .
" now that it 's being discussed , they 're realizing how little they actually know .
at the moment , we 're experiencing a time of complete confusion . " he explained that much of the population is appalled by the wave of recent media reports depicting the crimes perpetrated by their forefathers . " the cat is out of the bag , " he said .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .

but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl .

currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .

" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2005 german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty . compared to aids sufferers in parts of africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe , hiv patients in germany enjoy first-class treatment .
they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .
" but five years ago , we decided to go international for various reasons .
an infectious virus such as hiv ca n't be tackled at a local level only .
we ca n't build walls to contain it , and the spread of aids in africa , india and china inevitably affects us , too .

they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .
" but five years ago , we decided to go international for various reasons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.06.2005 german girls discover the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moment of victory for the german women at the 2003 world cup the success of the germany 's women 's soccer team internationally is rubbing off at home , with more girls playing the sport competitively .
but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl .

it boasts the game 's leading scorer and two-time fifa world player of the year .
and now it finds itself on the cusp of winning yet another title . the women 's national team success in the past few years is something michael ballack , oliver kahn and co. can only dream about .
aside from the surprise second place showing at the last world cup , the men 's squad have had been mired in mediocrity since winning the european championships in 1998 . the women , on the other hand , have risen to challenge the united states as the premier women 's soccer side in the world .
led by striker birgit prinz , who two weeks ago became germany 's all time scoring leader , the german women have been routinely crushing the opposition at the 2005 european championships tournament in england over the past two weeks . german women steamroll into final on june 19 , tina theune-meyer 's team will take on norway in the final of the tournament .
up until now , germany had beaten its opening round opponents of france , italy and norway by an aggregate score of 8-0 .
in the semi-final against finland , they won 4-1 .
and theune-meyer had only one criticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer on her team letting in one goal during the whole tournament : " these things happen . "
" i wanted us to go the whole tournament without letting one in , " she said .
" those things happen . " led by a young attack of inka grings and conny pohlers , both of whom have scored three goals apiece in the tournament , germany has not had to rely on the game-turning abilities of prinz too often .
norway , on the other hand , has made a hard-fought trip into the finals , beating sweden 3-2 on an extra time goal in a thrilling semi-final on thursday .
the norwegians say they are ready for germany .
" we only have two days of rest to prepare to play the best team in the world , " said coach bjaren berntsen .
" although we will not use tiredness as an excuse . " soccer , a full time job germany 's dominance in england is merely a confirmation of their status as world-beaters in their sport .
and theune-meyer said sponsors are beginning to notice .
" they identify themselves with the attributes that make up women 's soccer : sassy , open and likeable , " she told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung ahead of the tournament .
" the players , through the live game coverage , have gotten popular … for many players , soccer is a full-time job . " in contrast to the us , where a successful , but short-lived women 's league folded in 2004 , germany 's women 's soccer league has slowly evolved into an established player on the german sporting scene .
aided by the success of prinz -lrb- photo -rrb- and company , women 's soccer is also one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade later , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa women 's soccer player of the year , birgit prinz , has been one of the reasons for soccer 's growing popularity among german girls .
global acceptance ? the fever is starting to get contagious .
the popular british movie " bend it like beckham , " about two women and their love for soccer scored big in the uk and the rest of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 eu constitution gets time for reflection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels votes to extend ratification process on the constitution late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .
while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .

in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .

but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl . " i 'm better than some of them , so they 've been able to learn something from me .

but according to british government spokesperson , the uk rejected the offer . in refusing the offer , britain said any change must be linked to reform of the bloc 's farm subsidies program . " it 's clear that what the presidency is proposing does n't clearly establish that link between any change to the rebate and reform of the budget , and the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- in particular , " prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said . speaking after blair had a private meeting withjuncker , he said the plan also contained an unacceptable request for additional funds from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands , which has also wanted to reform the eu budgetary process , and lower its per capita contributions , also said it was n't ready to accept an offer from juncker of a contribution relief package of some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 860 million -rrb- .
after the decisive dutch ' no ' vote on the eu constitution , prime minister jan peter balkenende -lrb- photo -rrb- is under intense pressure at home to cut contribution levels significantly . compromise attempt earlier in the day , french president jacques chirac had made it known he would accept a freeze on the uk 's annual refund from eu coffers rather than the outright cut he sought if it helped clinch a package deal at the summit . at issue is the rebate britain receives every year from the eu budget , which was won in 1984 through the tough negotiation of then-prime minister margaret thatcher .
the rebate is worth 5.1 billion euros out of a 106.3 billion euro eu budget this year and is projected to rise to nearly eight billion euros by 2013 if the mechanism is not changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has said it will not accept any kind of change to the rebate agreement unless other eu expenditures , such as france 's large agricultural subsidies , are also reexamined .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 ankara haunted by armenian massacre großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armenians honor the 1.5 million victims of turkish violence when the german parliament condemned the mass killing of armenians by turks 90 years ago , it sparked angry protest from ankara .
but if it wants to be taken seriously by the eu , it needs to face up to its past . in a vote thursday , germany 's main parliamentary parties joined forces to deplore the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians between 1915 and 1916 . berlin is now urging turkey to set up an independent committee of turkish , armenian and international historians to document what happened . the resolution looks set to test relations between ankara and berlin .
so far , the german government has been a key supporter of turkish eu aspirations . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul described the resolution as one-sided and " provocative , " and said german lawmakers had ignored repeated warnings of the harm the resolution would do to bilateral ties . time for reconciliation faruk sen is the director of the center for turkish studies in essen in germany .
he feels disapointed by the turkish foreign minister 's harsh criticism of the resolution , and says turkey has to look forward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 80,000 armenians live in turkey , " he told dw radio .
" each year , more than 100,000 come to turkey to work there .
it is time for reconciliation .
i think to look back on 90 years of history does n't help at all .
turkey and armenia need good relations today . " genocide ? turkey is worried that it will come under mounting pressure to recognize the killings as " genocide " after it starts eu entry talks in october .
other european nations , including poland and greece , have also passed resolutions condemning the genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac of france , home to europe 's largest armenian diaspora , said failure by turkey to recognize the genocide could harm the country 's eu bid . faruk sen , however , is critical of the eu 's stance . " if that 's the opinion of the eu , it is a shame , " he insisted .
" because then , turkey and the eu can not negotiate anymore .
the eu would have to do without turkey . " turkey gets impatient the german resolution comes at a time when the eu is already displeased with turkey over its dragging human rights and judicial reform . faruk sen says the eu has tested turkey 's patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " people in turkey are increasingly against the eu and now the armenia debate has been added to turkey 's obligations to join the eu .
i think if the eu-membership fails because of the armenia-issue , the people in turkey wo n't be too sad . " turkey denies the claims that 1.5 million armenians were slaughtered in a systematic genocide between 1915 and 1923 as the multi-ethnic ottoman empire collapsed .
it accepts that hundreds of thousands of armenians were killed , but says even more turks died in a partisan conflict in which many armenians backed invading russian troops . ignorance and taboos but political theorist ahmet insel pointed out that the reason so many turks deny the extent of the massacre has nothing to do with nationalistic or racist sentiment - it 's simply ignorance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul residents , many of them new arrivals in this 10-million city which gets 200,000 migrants from the countryside annually , crowd a street lined with street vendors in downtown eminonu on may 19 , 1996 .
the united nations conference on world 's cities , habitat ii , will begin in istanbul on june 3 to discuss problems of cities like istanbul .
more than 20,000 people are expected to convene in istanbul for the summit , adding to its chaos on the streets and traffic jams .
-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- " generations of turks have grown up never learning about this tragedy , " he said .
" now that it 's being discussed , they 're realizing how little they actually know .
at the moment , we 're experiencing a time of complete confusion . " he explained that much of the population is appalled by the wave of recent media reports depicting the crimes perpetrated by their forefathers . " the cat is out of the bag , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 ankara haunted by armenian massacre großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armenians honor the 1.5 million victims of turkish violence when the german parliament condemned the mass killing of armenians by turks 90 years ago , it sparked angry protest from ankara .
but if it wants to be taken seriously by the eu , it needs to face up to its past . in a vote thursday , germany 's main parliamentary parties joined forces to deplore the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians between 1915 and 1916 . berlin is now urging turkey to set up an independent committee of turkish , armenian and international historians to document what happened . the resolution looks set to test relations between ankara and berlin .
so far , the german government has been a key supporter of turkish eu aspirations . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul described the resolution as one-sided and " provocative , " and said german lawmakers had ignored repeated warnings of the harm the resolution would do to bilateral ties . time for reconciliation faruk sen is the director of the center for turkish studies in essen in germany .
he feels disapointed by the turkish foreign minister 's harsh criticism of the resolution , and says turkey has to look forward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 80,000 armenians live in turkey , " he told dw radio .
" each year , more than 100,000 come to turkey to work there .
it is time for reconciliation .
i think to look back on 90 years of history does n't help at all .
turkey and armenia need good relations today . " genocide ? turkey is worried that it will come under mounting pressure to recognize the killings as " genocide " after it starts eu entry talks in october .
other european nations , including poland and greece , have also passed resolutions condemning the genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac of france , home to europe 's largest armenian diaspora , said failure by turkey to recognize the genocide could harm the country 's eu bid . faruk sen , however , is critical of the eu 's stance . " if that 's the opinion of the eu , it is a shame , " he insisted .
" because then , turkey and the eu can not negotiate anymore .
the eu would have to do without turkey . " turkey gets impatient the german resolution comes at a time when the eu is already displeased with turkey over its dragging human rights and judicial reform . faruk sen says the eu has tested turkey 's patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " people in turkey are increasingly against the eu and now the armenia debate has been added to turkey 's obligations to join the eu .
i think if the eu-membership fails because of the armenia-issue , the people in turkey wo n't be too sad . " turkey denies the claims that 1.5 million armenians were slaughtered in a systematic genocide between 1915 and 1923 as the multi-ethnic ottoman empire collapsed .
it accepts that hundreds of thousands of armenians were killed , but says even more turks died in a partisan conflict in which many armenians backed invading russian troops . ignorance and taboos but political theorist ahmet insel pointed out that the reason so many turks deny the extent of the massacre has nothing to do with nationalistic or racist sentiment - it 's simply ignorance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul residents , many of them new arrivals in this 10-million city which gets 200,000 migrants from the countryside annually , crowd a street lined with street vendors in downtown eminonu on may 19 , 1996 .
the united nations conference on world 's cities , habitat ii , will begin in istanbul on june 3 to discuss problems of cities like istanbul .
more than 20,000 people are expected to convene in istanbul for the summit , adding to its chaos on the streets and traffic jams .
-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- " generations of turks have grown up never learning about this tragedy , " he said .
" now that it 's being discussed , they 're realizing how little they actually know .
at the moment , we 're experiencing a time of complete confusion . " he explained that much of the population is appalled by the wave of recent media reports depicting the crimes perpetrated by their forefathers . " the cat is out of the bag , " he said .

but what would have been easy in a healthy eu is almost impossible now . " rzeczpospolita in warsaw thought that europe 's leaders were simply clueless about how to go on .
" six or 12 extra months wo n't change anything , " the paper wrote .
" we 're certainly at the beginning of a long crisis for integration . "
but the daily added that the current situation might turn out to be a positive thing for the eu .
" the union does n't have a choice any more .
it can deal with its problems , but only if it becomes a world power whose citizens completely identify with it . " the cellesche zeitung in northern germany wrote that halting the ratification process was a wise move .
" it certainly is n't a sign for integration when the shock is so big that the opinions of the other country get ignored , " the paper wrote .
" they have to feel like second-class eu members .
new negotiations should only commence once all countries have voted .
not earlier . " and writing about britain 's refusal to give up a decade-old budget rebate and instead calling for an overall budget reform , the times of london said germany 's main opposition christian democrat leader angela merkel was a " useful ally , " saying her support for reform had " shown more leadership than most of the prime ministers gathered around the table in brussels .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .
" the eu will only strike an agreement on its future financing if all sides are willing to be flexible at this pivotal summit , " he said thursday . tired of being paymaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany wants an agreement .
but it is clear that it will only be possible if everyone moves , " schröder said on arrival at the metting which is deadlocked over the 2007-2013 budget plans " but whether that is possible is an open question , " he added . the negotiations are blocked by britain 's refusal to abandon its cherished european union budget rebate , although there is also fierce disagreement over overall contribution levels . germany is the biggest net contributor to the european union 's roughly $ 100-billion-a-year budget .
but with its public finances already very tight , berlin appears increasingly weary of its role as europe 's paymaster , especially since the 2007-2013 spending proposals would suck billions more out of its budget . britain takes the rap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before heading to brussels , the chancellor took aim at britain 's eu budget rebate , secured by former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid .
britain is strongly against luxembourg 's proposal to freeze it in 2007 and later " set it on a downward path . " " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " schröder said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . "
but opposition leader angela merkel , on course to challenge schröder if elections are held in september , voiced some support for prime minister blair .
" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .
for now , more than 40 percent of the overall budget is spent on the common agricultural policy , with france the biggest recipient of farm funds . gearing up for a fight swedish prime minister goran persson weighed in friday saying he thought it was unlikely a deal on the budget would be reached in one day , and pointed out the eu still had a year to sort out its differences .
" i 'm still very pessimistic and i think we should not rush into a deal today , " he told reporters .
" we all hope there will be a deal but it 's better to take a year more and negotiate , " he said , adding there was a need to re-examine the balance between eu farm and regional aid . jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president said he was ready for a fight .
" i predict a day of many battle , and i 'm going to be in shape , " he warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wrangling could carry over into an unscheduled session on saturday , if leaders decide a deal is within their grasp after all . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution gets time for reflection late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .

they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .

" as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .

they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .
" but five years ago , we decided to go international for various reasons .
an infectious virus such as hiv ca n't be tackled at a local level only .

but according to british government spokesperson , the uk rejected the offer . in refusing the offer , britain said any change must be linked to reform of the bloc 's farm subsidies program . " it 's clear that what the presidency is proposing does n't clearly establish that link between any change to the rebate and reform of the budget , and the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- in particular , " prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said . speaking after blair had a private meeting withjuncker , he said the plan also contained an unacceptable request for additional funds from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands , which has also wanted to reform the eu budgetary process , and lower its per capita contributions , also said it was n't ready to accept an offer from juncker of a contribution relief package of some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 860 million -rrb- .
after the decisive dutch ' no ' vote on the eu constitution , prime minister jan peter balkenende -lrb- photo -rrb- is under intense pressure at home to cut contribution levels significantly . compromise attempt earlier in the day , french president jacques chirac had made it known he would accept a freeze on the uk 's annual refund from eu coffers rather than the outright cut he sought if it helped clinch a package deal at the summit . at issue is the rebate britain receives every year from the eu budget , which was won in 1984 through the tough negotiation of then-prime minister margaret thatcher .
the rebate is worth 5.1 billion euros out of a 106.3 billion euro eu budget this year and is projected to rise to nearly eight billion euros by 2013 if the mechanism is not changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has said it will not accept any kind of change to the rebate agreement unless other eu expenditures , such as france 's large agricultural subsidies , are also reexamined .
france 's chirac has staunchly defended the agricultural subsides , but said earlier today he was ready to compromise . " a freeze is not enough , but if it is a compromise , like all compromises , we 'll have to accept that it does n't make everyone happy , " an aide to chirac told reporters . but a british official swiftly belittled the move . " graciously accepting an offer we rejected three days ago does n't do it for us , " a british official said .
" we do n't think it 's much of a concession .
it would mean us losing between 25 and 30 billion euros -lrb- over seven years -rrb- . " constitution in tatters europe 's grand plans for its first constitution lay in disarray in brussels on friday after eu leaders put the charter on hold for at least a year to win over deeply sceptical voters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the european union consigned the charter - crafted over four years as new ground rules for an expanded 25-nation alliance - to the deep freeze after devastating ballot reversals in france and the netherlands . they abandoned a november 2006 deadline for ratification of the constitution , and set no new date for its adoption .
the treaty must be ratified by every member state to come into legal effect .
eu leaders decided to come back and check the treaty 's pulse , but not for another year . " we all agreed to come back to the subject in june 2006 to make an overall evaluation of national debates and to see how best to proceed with the process of ratification , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said . still , most countries refused to declare the deal dead . " i do not think europe is in crisis , " said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we should not dramatize the situation because , for the constitution we have time , we will see .
but we have to explain it to our citizens . " is there hope ? but there has never been a clear answer as to how the treaty can overcome the french and dutch setbacks , even though it has been ratified by 10 member states .
the netherlands pronounced the last rites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" the dutch were very clear in their ' no ' and that 's why we as a governement said that we do n't see any chance for a second referendum , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .
it is his second home , one that compels him and to which he has dedicated a love song with his latest film . petra tabeling -lrb- win -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german film flexes its muscles in cannes as cannes gears up for its 58th film festival , germany is breathing a sigh of relief that after years banished to the celluloid wilderness , its film industry is well-represented for the second year running .

bergen in new jersey also comes to mind .
but a 44-year-old woman with 843 grams -lrb- 30 ounces -rrb- of heroin hidden in the hollow heels of her boots managed to think of a third option . there 's another bergen , on the german island of rügen in the baltic sea .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .

a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .

but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl . " i 'm better than some of them , so they 've been able to learn something from me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 eu leaders deadlocked on budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's juncker did what he could , but it was n't enough despite a last-ditch bid friday to break a deadlock between britain and france over future eu financing , the uk rejected a french concession on an eu rebate , preventing the bloc from agreeing on a 2007 - 2013 budget . current eu president , prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg , called tony blair and several other eu leaders into a crisis meeting late in the day to make a final offer in order to secure an agreement for the budget .
but according to british government spokesperson , the uk rejected the offer . in refusing the offer , britain said any change must be linked to reform of the bloc 's farm subsidies program . " it 's clear that what the presidency is proposing does n't clearly establish that link between any change to the rebate and reform of the budget , and the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- in particular , " prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said . speaking after blair had a private meeting withjuncker , he said the plan also contained an unacceptable request for additional funds from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands , which has also wanted to reform the eu budgetary process , and lower its per capita contributions , also said it was n't ready to accept an offer from juncker of a contribution relief package of some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 860 million -rrb- .
after the decisive dutch ' no ' vote on the eu constitution , prime minister jan peter balkenende -lrb- photo -rrb- is under intense pressure at home to cut contribution levels significantly . compromise attempt earlier in the day , french president jacques chirac had made it known he would accept a freeze on the uk 's annual refund from eu coffers rather than the outright cut he sought if it helped clinch a package deal at the summit . at issue is the rebate britain receives every year from the eu budget , which was won in 1984 through the tough negotiation of then-prime minister margaret thatcher .
the rebate is worth 5.1 billion euros out of a 106.3 billion euro eu budget this year and is projected to rise to nearly eight billion euros by 2013 if the mechanism is not changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has said it will not accept any kind of change to the rebate agreement unless other eu expenditures , such as france 's large agricultural subsidies , are also reexamined .
france 's chirac has staunchly defended the agricultural subsides , but said earlier today he was ready to compromise . " a freeze is not enough , but if it is a compromise , like all compromises , we 'll have to accept that it does n't make everyone happy , " an aide to chirac told reporters . but a british official swiftly belittled the move . " graciously accepting an offer we rejected three days ago does n't do it for us , " a british official said .
" we do n't think it 's much of a concession .
it would mean us losing between 25 and 30 billion euros -lrb- over seven years -rrb- . " constitution in tatters europe 's grand plans for its first constitution lay in disarray in brussels on friday after eu leaders put the charter on hold for at least a year to win over deeply sceptical voters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the european union consigned the charter - crafted over four years as new ground rules for an expanded 25-nation alliance - to the deep freeze after devastating ballot reversals in france and the netherlands . they abandoned a november 2006 deadline for ratification of the constitution , and set no new date for its adoption .
the treaty must be ratified by every member state to come into legal effect .
eu leaders decided to come back and check the treaty 's pulse , but not for another year . " we all agreed to come back to the subject in june 2006 to make an overall evaluation of national debates and to see how best to proceed with the process of ratification , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said . still , most countries refused to declare the deal dead . " i do not think europe is in crisis , " said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we should not dramatize the situation because , for the constitution we have time , we will see .
but we have to explain it to our citizens . " is there hope ? but there has never been a clear answer as to how the treaty can overcome the french and dutch setbacks , even though it has been ratified by 10 member states .
the netherlands pronounced the last rites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" the dutch were very clear in their ' no ' and that 's why we as a governement said that we do n't see any chance for a second referendum , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai .
" it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " and if it is dead in the netherlands , then according to eu rules , it is dead everywhere . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders face-off over budget as eu leaders begin day two of their summit in brussels on the crisis besetting the union , they face a new test in their willingness to compromise , with negotiations on the budget for 2007 to 2013 topping the agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.06.2005 german girls discover the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moment of victory for the german women at the 2003 world cup the success of the germany 's women 's soccer team internationally is rubbing off at home , with more girls playing the sport competitively .
but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl . " i 'm better than some of them , so they 've been able to learn something from me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2005 german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty . compared to aids sufferers in parts of africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe , hiv patients in germany enjoy first-class treatment .
they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .
" but five years ago , we decided to go international for various reasons .
an infectious virus such as hiv ca n't be tackled at a local level only .
we ca n't build walls to contain it , and the spread of aids in africa , india and china inevitably affects us , too . " helle jeppesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to increase support of aids fight germany 's development minister has announced plans to boost programs aimed at fighting the aids epidemic in the developing world , saying current efforts to tackle the epidemic are showing results in several regions .

since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .
" but five years ago , we decided to go international for various reasons .
an infectious virus such as hiv ca n't be tackled at a local level only .

but according to british government spokesperson , the uk rejected the offer . in refusing the offer , britain said any change must be linked to reform of the bloc 's farm subsidies program . " it 's clear that what the presidency is proposing does n't clearly establish that link between any change to the rebate and reform of the budget , and the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- in particular , " prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said . speaking after blair had a private meeting withjuncker , he said the plan also contained an unacceptable request for additional funds from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands , which has also wanted to reform the eu budgetary process , and lower its per capita contributions , also said it was n't ready to accept an offer from juncker of a contribution relief package of some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 860 million -rrb- .
after the decisive dutch ' no ' vote on the eu constitution , prime minister jan peter balkenende -lrb- photo -rrb- is under intense pressure at home to cut contribution levels significantly . compromise attempt earlier in the day , french president jacques chirac had made it known he would accept a freeze on the uk 's annual refund from eu coffers rather than the outright cut he sought if it helped clinch a package deal at the summit . at issue is the rebate britain receives every year from the eu budget , which was won in 1984 through the tough negotiation of then-prime minister margaret thatcher .
the rebate is worth 5.1 billion euros out of a 106.3 billion euro eu budget this year and is projected to rise to nearly eight billion euros by 2013 if the mechanism is not changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has said it will not accept any kind of change to the rebate agreement unless other eu expenditures , such as france 's large agricultural subsidies , are also reexamined .
france 's chirac has staunchly defended the agricultural subsides , but said earlier today he was ready to compromise . " a freeze is not enough , but if it is a compromise , like all compromises , we 'll have to accept that it does n't make everyone happy , " an aide to chirac told reporters . but a british official swiftly belittled the move . " graciously accepting an offer we rejected three days ago does n't do it for us , " a british official said .
" we do n't think it 's much of a concession .
it would mean us losing between 25 and 30 billion euros -lrb- over seven years -rrb- . " constitution in tatters europe 's grand plans for its first constitution lay in disarray in brussels on friday after eu leaders put the charter on hold for at least a year to win over deeply sceptical voters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the european union consigned the charter - crafted over four years as new ground rules for an expanded 25-nation alliance - to the deep freeze after devastating ballot reversals in france and the netherlands . they abandoned a november 2006 deadline for ratification of the constitution , and set no new date for its adoption .
the treaty must be ratified by every member state to come into legal effect .
eu leaders decided to come back and check the treaty 's pulse , but not for another year . " we all agreed to come back to the subject in june 2006 to make an overall evaluation of national debates and to see how best to proceed with the process of ratification , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said . still , most countries refused to declare the deal dead . " i do not think europe is in crisis , " said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we should not dramatize the situation because , for the constitution we have time , we will see .
but we have to explain it to our citizens . " is there hope ? but there has never been a clear answer as to how the treaty can overcome the french and dutch setbacks , even though it has been ratified by 10 member states .
the netherlands pronounced the last rites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" the dutch were very clear in their ' no ' and that 's why we as a governement said that we do n't see any chance for a second referendum , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai .
" it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " and if it is dead in the netherlands , then according to eu rules , it is dead everywhere . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders face-off over budget as eu leaders begin day two of their summit in brussels on the crisis besetting the union , they face a new test in their willingness to compromise , with negotiations on the budget for 2007 to 2013 topping the agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 eu leaders deadlocked on budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's juncker did what he could , but it was n't enough despite a last-ditch bid friday to break a deadlock between britain and france over future eu financing , the uk rejected a french concession on an eu rebate , preventing the bloc from agreeing on a 2007 - 2013 budget . current eu president , prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg , called tony blair and several other eu leaders into a crisis meeting late in the day to make a final offer in order to secure an agreement for the budget .
but according to british government spokesperson , the uk rejected the offer . in refusing the offer , britain said any change must be linked to reform of the bloc 's farm subsidies program . " it 's clear that what the presidency is proposing does n't clearly establish that link between any change to the rebate and reform of the budget , and the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- in particular , " prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said . speaking after blair had a private meeting withjuncker , he said the plan also contained an unacceptable request for additional funds from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands , which has also wanted to reform the eu budgetary process , and lower its per capita contributions , also said it was n't ready to accept an offer from juncker of a contribution relief package of some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 860 million -rrb- .
after the decisive dutch ' no ' vote on the eu constitution , prime minister jan peter balkenende -lrb- photo -rrb- is under intense pressure at home to cut contribution levels significantly . compromise attempt earlier in the day , french president jacques chirac had made it known he would accept a freeze on the uk 's annual refund from eu coffers rather than the outright cut he sought if it helped clinch a package deal at the summit . at issue is the rebate britain receives every year from the eu budget , which was won in 1984 through the tough negotiation of then-prime minister margaret thatcher .
the rebate is worth 5.1 billion euros out of a 106.3 billion euro eu budget this year and is projected to rise to nearly eight billion euros by 2013 if the mechanism is not changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has said it will not accept any kind of change to the rebate agreement unless other eu expenditures , such as france 's large agricultural subsidies , are also reexamined .
france 's chirac has staunchly defended the agricultural subsides , but said earlier today he was ready to compromise . " a freeze is not enough , but if it is a compromise , like all compromises , we 'll have to accept that it does n't make everyone happy , " an aide to chirac told reporters . but a british official swiftly belittled the move . " graciously accepting an offer we rejected three days ago does n't do it for us , " a british official said .
" we do n't think it 's much of a concession .
it would mean us losing between 25 and 30 billion euros -lrb- over seven years -rrb- . " constitution in tatters europe 's grand plans for its first constitution lay in disarray in brussels on friday after eu leaders put the charter on hold for at least a year to win over deeply sceptical voters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the european union consigned the charter - crafted over four years as new ground rules for an expanded 25-nation alliance - to the deep freeze after devastating ballot reversals in france and the netherlands . they abandoned a november 2006 deadline for ratification of the constitution , and set no new date for its adoption .
the treaty must be ratified by every member state to come into legal effect .
eu leaders decided to come back and check the treaty 's pulse , but not for another year . " we all agreed to come back to the subject in june 2006 to make an overall evaluation of national debates and to see how best to proceed with the process of ratification , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said . still , most countries refused to declare the deal dead . " i do not think europe is in crisis , " said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we should not dramatize the situation because , for the constitution we have time , we will see .
but we have to explain it to our citizens . " is there hope ? but there has never been a clear answer as to how the treaty can overcome the french and dutch setbacks , even though it has been ratified by 10 member states .
the netherlands pronounced the last rites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" the dutch were very clear in their ' no ' and that 's why we as a governement said that we do n't see any chance for a second referendum , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai .
" it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty .

but according to british government spokesperson , the uk rejected the offer . in refusing the offer , britain said any change must be linked to reform of the bloc 's farm subsidies program . " it 's clear that what the presidency is proposing does n't clearly establish that link between any change to the rebate and reform of the budget , and the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- in particular , " prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said . speaking after blair had a private meeting withjuncker , he said the plan also contained an unacceptable request for additional funds from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands , which has also wanted to reform the eu budgetary process , and lower its per capita contributions , also said it was n't ready to accept an offer from juncker of a contribution relief package of some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 860 million -rrb- .
after the decisive dutch ' no ' vote on the eu constitution , prime minister jan peter balkenende -lrb- photo -rrb- is under intense pressure at home to cut contribution levels significantly . compromise attempt earlier in the day , french president jacques chirac had made it known he would accept a freeze on the uk 's annual refund from eu coffers rather than the outright cut he sought if it helped clinch a package deal at the summit . at issue is the rebate britain receives every year from the eu budget , which was won in 1984 through the tough negotiation of then-prime minister margaret thatcher .
the rebate is worth 5.1 billion euros out of a 106.3 billion euro eu budget this year and is projected to rise to nearly eight billion euros by 2013 if the mechanism is not changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has said it will not accept any kind of change to the rebate agreement unless other eu expenditures , such as france 's large agricultural subsidies , are also reexamined .
france 's chirac has staunchly defended the agricultural subsides , but said earlier today he was ready to compromise . " a freeze is not enough , but if it is a compromise , like all compromises , we 'll have to accept that it does n't make everyone happy , " an aide to chirac told reporters . but a british official swiftly belittled the move . " graciously accepting an offer we rejected three days ago does n't do it for us , " a british official said .
" we do n't think it 's much of a concession .
it would mean us losing between 25 and 30 billion euros -lrb- over seven years -rrb- . " constitution in tatters europe 's grand plans for its first constitution lay in disarray in brussels on friday after eu leaders put the charter on hold for at least a year to win over deeply sceptical voters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the european union consigned the charter - crafted over four years as new ground rules for an expanded 25-nation alliance - to the deep freeze after devastating ballot reversals in france and the netherlands . they abandoned a november 2006 deadline for ratification of the constitution , and set no new date for its adoption .
the treaty must be ratified by every member state to come into legal effect .
eu leaders decided to come back and check the treaty 's pulse , but not for another year . " we all agreed to come back to the subject in june 2006 to make an overall evaluation of national debates and to see how best to proceed with the process of ratification , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said . still , most countries refused to declare the deal dead . " i do not think europe is in crisis , " said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we should not dramatize the situation because , for the constitution we have time , we will see .
but we have to explain it to our citizens . " is there hope ? but there has never been a clear answer as to how the treaty can overcome the french and dutch setbacks , even though it has been ratified by 10 member states .
the netherlands pronounced the last rites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" the dutch were very clear in their ' no ' and that 's why we as a governement said that we do n't see any chance for a second referendum , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai .
" it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " and if it is dead in the netherlands , then according to eu rules , it is dead everywhere . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders face-off over budget as eu leaders begin day two of their summit in brussels on the crisis besetting the union , they face a new test in their willingness to compromise , with negotiations on the budget for 2007 to 2013 topping the agenda .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .
" the eu will only strike an agreement on its future financing if all sides are willing to be flexible at this pivotal summit , " he said thursday . tired of being paymaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany wants an agreement .
but it is clear that it will only be possible if everyone moves , " schröder said on arrival at the metting which is deadlocked over the 2007-2013 budget plans " but whether that is possible is an open question , " he added . the negotiations are blocked by britain 's refusal to abandon its cherished european union budget rebate , although there is also fierce disagreement over overall contribution levels . germany is the biggest net contributor to the european union 's roughly $ 100-billion-a-year budget .
but with its public finances already very tight , berlin appears increasingly weary of its role as europe 's paymaster , especially since the 2007-2013 spending proposals would suck billions more out of its budget . britain takes the rap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before heading to brussels , the chancellor took aim at britain 's eu budget rebate , secured by former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid .
britain is strongly against luxembourg 's proposal to freeze it in 2007 and later " set it on a downward path . " " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " schröder said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . "
but opposition leader angela merkel , on course to challenge schröder if elections are held in september , voiced some support for prime minister blair .
" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .
for now , more than 40 percent of the overall budget is spent on the common agricultural policy , with france the biggest recipient of farm funds . gearing up for a fight swedish prime minister goran persson weighed in friday saying he thought it was unlikely a deal on the budget would be reached in one day , and pointed out the eu still had a year to sort out its differences .
" i 'm still very pessimistic and i think we should not rush into a deal today , " he told reporters .
" we all hope there will be a deal but it 's better to take a year more and negotiate , " he said , adding there was a need to re-examine the balance between eu farm and regional aid . jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president said he was ready for a fight .
" i predict a day of many battle , and i 'm going to be in shape , " he warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wrangling could carry over into an unscheduled session on saturday , if leaders decide a deal is within their grasp after all . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution gets time for reflection late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .
" the eu will only strike an agreement on its future financing if all sides are willing to be flexible at this pivotal summit , " he said thursday . tired of being paymaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany wants an agreement .
but it is clear that it will only be possible if everyone moves , " schröder said on arrival at the metting which is deadlocked over the 2007-2013 budget plans " but whether that is possible is an open question , " he added . the negotiations are blocked by britain 's refusal to abandon its cherished european union budget rebate , although there is also fierce disagreement over overall contribution levels . germany is the biggest net contributor to the european union 's roughly $ 100-billion-a-year budget .
but with its public finances already very tight , berlin appears increasingly weary of its role as europe 's paymaster , especially since the 2007-2013 spending proposals would suck billions more out of its budget . britain takes the rap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before heading to brussels , the chancellor took aim at britain 's eu budget rebate , secured by former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid .
britain is strongly against luxembourg 's proposal to freeze it in 2007 and later " set it on a downward path . " " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " schröder said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . "
but opposition leader angela merkel , on course to challenge schröder if elections are held in september , voiced some support for prime minister blair .
" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .
for now , more than 40 percent of the overall budget is spent on the common agricultural policy , with france the biggest recipient of farm funds . gearing up for a fight swedish prime minister goran persson weighed in friday saying he thought it was unlikely a deal on the budget would be reached in one day , and pointed out the eu still had a year to sort out its differences .
" i 'm still very pessimistic and i think we should not rush into a deal today , " he told reporters .
" we all hope there will be a deal but it 's better to take a year more and negotiate , " he said , adding there was a need to re-examine the balance between eu farm and regional aid . jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president said he was ready for a fight .
" i predict a day of many battle , and i 'm going to be in shape , " he warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wrangling could carry over into an unscheduled session on saturday , if leaders decide a deal is within their grasp after all . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution gets time for reflection late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?

they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .

the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2005 german aids foundation thinks positive when the german aids foundation presented its annual report in bonn on friday , it revealed that even in germany , one common side-effect of hiv infection is poverty . compared to aids sufferers in parts of africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe , hiv patients in germany enjoy first-class treatment .
they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .
" but five years ago , we decided to go international for various reasons .
an infectious virus such as hiv ca n't be tackled at a local level only .
we ca n't build walls to contain it , and the spread of aids in africa , india and china inevitably affects us , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 eu constitution gets time for reflection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels votes to extend ratification process on the constitution late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .
while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 eu constitution gets time for reflection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels votes to extend ratification process on the constitution late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .
while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 ankara haunted by armenian massacre großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armenians honor the 1.5 million victims of turkish violence when the german parliament condemned the mass killing of armenians by turks 90 years ago , it sparked angry protest from ankara .
but if it wants to be taken seriously by the eu , it needs to face up to its past . in a vote thursday , germany 's main parliamentary parties joined forces to deplore the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians between 1915 and 1916 . berlin is now urging turkey to set up an independent committee of turkish , armenian and international historians to document what happened . the resolution looks set to test relations between ankara and berlin .
so far , the german government has been a key supporter of turkish eu aspirations . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul described the resolution as one-sided and " provocative , " and said german lawmakers had ignored repeated warnings of the harm the resolution would do to bilateral ties . time for reconciliation faruk sen is the director of the center for turkish studies in essen in germany .
he feels disapointed by the turkish foreign minister 's harsh criticism of the resolution , and says turkey has to look forward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 80,000 armenians live in turkey , " he told dw radio .
" each year , more than 100,000 come to turkey to work there .
it is time for reconciliation .
i think to look back on 90 years of history does n't help at all .
turkey and armenia need good relations today . " genocide ? turkey is worried that it will come under mounting pressure to recognize the killings as " genocide " after it starts eu entry talks in october .
other european nations , including poland and greece , have also passed resolutions condemning the genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac of france , home to europe 's largest armenian diaspora , said failure by turkey to recognize the genocide could harm the country 's eu bid . faruk sen , however , is critical of the eu 's stance . " if that 's the opinion of the eu , it is a shame , " he insisted .
" because then , turkey and the eu can not negotiate anymore .
the eu would have to do without turkey . " turkey gets impatient the german resolution comes at a time when the eu is already displeased with turkey over its dragging human rights and judicial reform . faruk sen says the eu has tested turkey 's patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " people in turkey are increasingly against the eu and now the armenia debate has been added to turkey 's obligations to join the eu .

but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .

but if it wants to be taken seriously by the eu , it needs to face up to its past . in a vote thursday , germany 's main parliamentary parties joined forces to deplore the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians between 1915 and 1916 . berlin is now urging turkey to set up an independent committee of turkish , armenian and international historians to document what happened . the resolution looks set to test relations between ankara and berlin .
so far , the german government has been a key supporter of turkish eu aspirations . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul described the resolution as one-sided and " provocative , " and said german lawmakers had ignored repeated warnings of the harm the resolution would do to bilateral ties . time for reconciliation faruk sen is the director of the center for turkish studies in essen in germany .
he feels disapointed by the turkish foreign minister 's harsh criticism of the resolution , and says turkey has to look forward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 80,000 armenians live in turkey , " he told dw radio .
" each year , more than 100,000 come to turkey to work there .
it is time for reconciliation .
i think to look back on 90 years of history does n't help at all .
turkey and armenia need good relations today . " genocide ? turkey is worried that it will come under mounting pressure to recognize the killings as " genocide " after it starts eu entry talks in october .
other european nations , including poland and greece , have also passed resolutions condemning the genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac of france , home to europe 's largest armenian diaspora , said failure by turkey to recognize the genocide could harm the country 's eu bid . faruk sen , however , is critical of the eu 's stance . " if that 's the opinion of the eu , it is a shame , " he insisted .
" because then , turkey and the eu can not negotiate anymore .
the eu would have to do without turkey . " turkey gets impatient the german resolution comes at a time when the eu is already displeased with turkey over its dragging human rights and judicial reform . faruk sen says the eu has tested turkey 's patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " people in turkey are increasingly against the eu and now the armenia debate has been added to turkey 's obligations to join the eu .
i think if the eu-membership fails because of the armenia-issue , the people in turkey wo n't be too sad . " turkey denies the claims that 1.5 million armenians were slaughtered in a systematic genocide between 1915 and 1923 as the multi-ethnic ottoman empire collapsed .
it accepts that hundreds of thousands of armenians were killed , but says even more turks died in a partisan conflict in which many armenians backed invading russian troops . ignorance and taboos but political theorist ahmet insel pointed out that the reason so many turks deny the extent of the massacre has nothing to do with nationalistic or racist sentiment - it 's simply ignorance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul residents , many of them new arrivals in this 10-million city which gets 200,000 migrants from the countryside annually , crowd a street lined with street vendors in downtown eminonu on may 19 , 1996 .

they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 eu constitution gets time for reflection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels votes to extend ratification process on the constitution late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .
while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

bergen in new jersey also comes to mind .
but a 44-year-old woman with 843 grams -lrb- 30 ounces -rrb- of heroin hidden in the hollow heels of her boots managed to think of a third option . there 's another bergen , on the german island of rügen in the baltic sea .
when the spanish drug smuggler was told to deliver her goods to , well , bergen , she booked a train ticket to northern germany .
when she arrived there and called her contacts , they told her that they were waiting for her much further north in norway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these houses stand in bergen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.06.2005 turkish music hits german cinemas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul 's modern face of music in his new film " crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul , " turkish-german director fatih akin embarks on a musical search for traditions .
the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .
and for this turkish rapper , that does n't have anything to do with drugs , money and fast cars .
even his father sees it this way . " turkey needs hip hop , " he says looking straight into akin 's camera .
flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "
music and identity also form a painful symbiosis in the life of kurdish singer aydur .
long banned from the stage , she is now allowed to play for her audiences once again , combining kurdish music with modern sounds .
" crossing the bridge – the sound of istanbul " documents 12 bands in the melting pot of istanbul , its various cultures and their unique music , including the experimental .
this has led to a new sense of self-awareness , one that - given the possibility of turkey 's entry into the eu - can not be lost , according to akin . bildunterschrift : " every place looks so much the same in the eu - everywhere the same shopping chains and the same products , " he says . for akin , who lives in hamburg and whose mother is from istanbul , the city on the bosporus and its music scene are very significant .
it is his second home , one that compels him and to which he has dedicated a love song with his latest film . petra tabeling -lrb- win -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german film flexes its muscles in cannes as cannes gears up for its 58th film festival , germany is breathing a sigh of relief that after years banished to the celluloid wilderness , its film industry is well-represented for the second year running .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .
" the eu will only strike an agreement on its future financing if all sides are willing to be flexible at this pivotal summit , " he said thursday . tired of being paymaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany wants an agreement .
but it is clear that it will only be possible if everyone moves , " schröder said on arrival at the metting which is deadlocked over the 2007-2013 budget plans " but whether that is possible is an open question , " he added . the negotiations are blocked by britain 's refusal to abandon its cherished european union budget rebate , although there is also fierce disagreement over overall contribution levels . germany is the biggest net contributor to the european union 's roughly $ 100-billion-a-year budget .
but with its public finances already very tight , berlin appears increasingly weary of its role as europe 's paymaster , especially since the 2007-2013 spending proposals would suck billions more out of its budget . britain takes the rap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before heading to brussels , the chancellor took aim at britain 's eu budget rebate , secured by former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid .
britain is strongly against luxembourg 's proposal to freeze it in 2007 and later " set it on a downward path . " " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " schröder said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . "
but opposition leader angela merkel , on course to challenge schröder if elections are held in september , voiced some support for prime minister blair .
" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .
for now , more than 40 percent of the overall budget is spent on the common agricultural policy , with france the biggest recipient of farm funds . gearing up for a fight swedish prime minister goran persson weighed in friday saying he thought it was unlikely a deal on the budget would be reached in one day , and pointed out the eu still had a year to sort out its differences .
" i 'm still very pessimistic and i think we should not rush into a deal today , " he told reporters .
" we all hope there will be a deal but it 's better to take a year more and negotiate , " he said , adding there was a need to re-examine the balance between eu farm and regional aid . jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president said he was ready for a fight .

but if it wants to be taken seriously by the eu , it needs to face up to its past . in a vote thursday , germany 's main parliamentary parties joined forces to deplore the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians between 1915 and 1916 . berlin is now urging turkey to set up an independent committee of turkish , armenian and international historians to document what happened . the resolution looks set to test relations between ankara and berlin .
so far , the german government has been a key supporter of turkish eu aspirations . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul described the resolution as one-sided and " provocative , " and said german lawmakers had ignored repeated warnings of the harm the resolution would do to bilateral ties . time for reconciliation faruk sen is the director of the center for turkish studies in essen in germany .
he feels disapointed by the turkish foreign minister 's harsh criticism of the resolution , and says turkey has to look forward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 80,000 armenians live in turkey , " he told dw radio .
" each year , more than 100,000 come to turkey to work there .
it is time for reconciliation .
i think to look back on 90 years of history does n't help at all .
turkey and armenia need good relations today . " genocide ? turkey is worried that it will come under mounting pressure to recognize the killings as " genocide " after it starts eu entry talks in october .
other european nations , including poland and greece , have also passed resolutions condemning the genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac of france , home to europe 's largest armenian diaspora , said failure by turkey to recognize the genocide could harm the country 's eu bid . faruk sen , however , is critical of the eu 's stance . " if that 's the opinion of the eu , it is a shame , " he insisted .
" because then , turkey and the eu can not negotiate anymore .
the eu would have to do without turkey . " turkey gets impatient the german resolution comes at a time when the eu is already displeased with turkey over its dragging human rights and judicial reform . faruk sen says the eu has tested turkey 's patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " people in turkey are increasingly against the eu and now the armenia debate has been added to turkey 's obligations to join the eu .
i think if the eu-membership fails because of the armenia-issue , the people in turkey wo n't be too sad . " turkey denies the claims that 1.5 million armenians were slaughtered in a systematic genocide between 1915 and 1923 as the multi-ethnic ottoman empire collapsed .
it accepts that hundreds of thousands of armenians were killed , but says even more turks died in a partisan conflict in which many armenians backed invading russian troops . ignorance and taboos but political theorist ahmet insel pointed out that the reason so many turks deny the extent of the massacre has nothing to do with nationalistic or racist sentiment - it 's simply ignorance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul residents , many of them new arrivals in this 10-million city which gets 200,000 migrants from the countryside annually , crowd a street lined with street vendors in downtown eminonu on may 19 , 1996 .

but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl . " i 'm better than some of them , so they 've been able to learn something from me .

but if it wants to be taken seriously by the eu , it needs to face up to its past . in a vote thursday , germany 's main parliamentary parties joined forces to deplore the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians between 1915 and 1916 . berlin is now urging turkey to set up an independent committee of turkish , armenian and international historians to document what happened . the resolution looks set to test relations between ankara and berlin .
so far , the german government has been a key supporter of turkish eu aspirations . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul described the resolution as one-sided and " provocative , " and said german lawmakers had ignored repeated warnings of the harm the resolution would do to bilateral ties . time for reconciliation faruk sen is the director of the center for turkish studies in essen in germany .
he feels disapointed by the turkish foreign minister 's harsh criticism of the resolution , and says turkey has to look forward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 80,000 armenians live in turkey , " he told dw radio .
" each year , more than 100,000 come to turkey to work there .
it is time for reconciliation .
i think to look back on 90 years of history does n't help at all .
turkey and armenia need good relations today . " genocide ? turkey is worried that it will come under mounting pressure to recognize the killings as " genocide " after it starts eu entry talks in october .
other european nations , including poland and greece , have also passed resolutions condemning the genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac of france , home to europe 's largest armenian diaspora , said failure by turkey to recognize the genocide could harm the country 's eu bid . faruk sen , however , is critical of the eu 's stance . " if that 's the opinion of the eu , it is a shame , " he insisted .
" because then , turkey and the eu can not negotiate anymore .
the eu would have to do without turkey . " turkey gets impatient the german resolution comes at a time when the eu is already displeased with turkey over its dragging human rights and judicial reform . faruk sen says the eu has tested turkey 's patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " people in turkey are increasingly against the eu and now the armenia debate has been added to turkey 's obligations to join the eu .
i think if the eu-membership fails because of the armenia-issue , the people in turkey wo n't be too sad . " turkey denies the claims that 1.5 million armenians were slaughtered in a systematic genocide between 1915 and 1923 as the multi-ethnic ottoman empire collapsed .
it accepts that hundreds of thousands of armenians were killed , but says even more turks died in a partisan conflict in which many armenians backed invading russian troops . ignorance and taboos but political theorist ahmet insel pointed out that the reason so many turks deny the extent of the massacre has nothing to do with nationalistic or racist sentiment - it 's simply ignorance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul residents , many of them new arrivals in this 10-million city which gets 200,000 migrants from the countryside annually , crowd a street lined with street vendors in downtown eminonu on may 19 , 1996 .
the united nations conference on world 's cities , habitat ii , will begin in istanbul on june 3 to discuss problems of cities like istanbul .
more than 20,000 people are expected to convene in istanbul for the summit , adding to its chaos on the streets and traffic jams .
-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- " generations of turks have grown up never learning about this tragedy , " he said .
" now that it 's being discussed , they 're realizing how little they actually know .
at the moment , we 're experiencing a time of complete confusion . " he explained that much of the population is appalled by the wave of recent media reports depicting the crimes perpetrated by their forefathers . " the cat is out of the bag , " he said .
" turkish society is finally beginning to talk about these matters .

day two might prove considerably less amicable , as they turn their attention to budgetary concerns . " this is the one of the most difficult summits we have ever had , " sighed jean asselborn , luxembourg 's foreign minister . chancellor gerhard schröder stressed the need for compromise .
" the eu will only strike an agreement on its future financing if all sides are willing to be flexible at this pivotal summit , " he said thursday . tired of being paymaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany wants an agreement .
but it is clear that it will only be possible if everyone moves , " schröder said on arrival at the metting which is deadlocked over the 2007-2013 budget plans " but whether that is possible is an open question , " he added . the negotiations are blocked by britain 's refusal to abandon its cherished european union budget rebate , although there is also fierce disagreement over overall contribution levels . germany is the biggest net contributor to the european union 's roughly $ 100-billion-a-year budget .
but with its public finances already very tight , berlin appears increasingly weary of its role as europe 's paymaster , especially since the 2007-2013 spending proposals would suck billions more out of its budget . britain takes the rap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before heading to brussels , the chancellor took aim at britain 's eu budget rebate , secured by former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid .
britain is strongly against luxembourg 's proposal to freeze it in 2007 and later " set it on a downward path . " " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " schröder said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . "
but opposition leader angela merkel , on course to challenge schröder if elections are held in september , voiced some support for prime minister blair .
" the british rebate is connected with agricultural subsidies , " she said .
" it is n't fair to say that agricultural subsidies are sacrosanct , but we demand flexibility from the other side . " britain has threatened to use its national veto to preserve its rebate , while france continues to insist that agricultural subsidies - which benefit french farmers - are off-limits .
for now , more than 40 percent of the overall budget is spent on the common agricultural policy , with france the biggest recipient of farm funds . gearing up for a fight swedish prime minister goran persson weighed in friday saying he thought it was unlikely a deal on the budget would be reached in one day , and pointed out the eu still had a year to sort out its differences .
" i 'm still very pessimistic and i think we should not rush into a deal today , " he told reporters .
" we all hope there will be a deal but it 's better to take a year more and negotiate , " he said , adding there was a need to re-examine the balance between eu farm and regional aid . jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister and current eu president said he was ready for a fight .
" i predict a day of many battle , and i 'm going to be in shape , " he warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wrangling could carry over into an unscheduled session on saturday , if leaders decide a deal is within their grasp after all . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution gets time for reflection late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.06.2005 german girls discover the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moment of victory for the german women at the 2003 world cup the success of the germany 's women 's soccer team internationally is rubbing off at home , with more girls playing the sport competitively .
but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl . " i 'm better than some of them , so they 've been able to learn something from me .

but according to british government spokesperson , the uk rejected the offer . in refusing the offer , britain said any change must be linked to reform of the bloc 's farm subsidies program . " it 's clear that what the presidency is proposing does n't clearly establish that link between any change to the rebate and reform of the budget , and the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- in particular , " prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said . speaking after blair had a private meeting withjuncker , he said the plan also contained an unacceptable request for additional funds from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands , which has also wanted to reform the eu budgetary process , and lower its per capita contributions , also said it was n't ready to accept an offer from juncker of a contribution relief package of some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 860 million -rrb- .
after the decisive dutch ' no ' vote on the eu constitution , prime minister jan peter balkenende -lrb- photo -rrb- is under intense pressure at home to cut contribution levels significantly . compromise attempt earlier in the day , french president jacques chirac had made it known he would accept a freeze on the uk 's annual refund from eu coffers rather than the outright cut he sought if it helped clinch a package deal at the summit . at issue is the rebate britain receives every year from the eu budget , which was won in 1984 through the tough negotiation of then-prime minister margaret thatcher .
the rebate is worth 5.1 billion euros out of a 106.3 billion euro eu budget this year and is projected to rise to nearly eight billion euros by 2013 if the mechanism is not changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has said it will not accept any kind of change to the rebate agreement unless other eu expenditures , such as france 's large agricultural subsidies , are also reexamined .
france 's chirac has staunchly defended the agricultural subsides , but said earlier today he was ready to compromise . " a freeze is not enough , but if it is a compromise , like all compromises , we 'll have to accept that it does n't make everyone happy , " an aide to chirac told reporters . but a british official swiftly belittled the move . " graciously accepting an offer we rejected three days ago does n't do it for us , " a british official said .

the treaty must be ratified by every member state to come into legal effect .
eu leaders decided to come back and check the treaty 's pulse , but not for another year .

" i do not think europe is in crisis , " said italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we should not dramatize the situation because , for the constitution we have time , we will see .

but according to british government spokesperson , the uk rejected the offer . in refusing the offer , britain said any change must be linked to reform of the bloc 's farm subsidies program . " it 's clear that what the presidency is proposing does n't clearly establish that link between any change to the rebate and reform of the budget , and the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- in particular , " prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said . speaking after blair had a private meeting withjuncker , he said the plan also contained an unacceptable request for additional funds from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands , which has also wanted to reform the eu budgetary process , and lower its per capita contributions , also said it was n't ready to accept an offer from juncker of a contribution relief package of some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 860 million -rrb- .

but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .

while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .

that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

it boasts the game 's leading scorer and two-time fifa world player of the year .
and now it finds itself on the cusp of winning yet another title . the women 's national team success in the past few years is something michael ballack , oliver kahn and co. can only dream about .
aside from the surprise second place showing at the last world cup , the men 's squad have had been mired in mediocrity since winning the european championships in 1998 . the women , on the other hand , have risen to challenge the united states as the premier women 's soccer side in the world .
led by striker birgit prinz , who two weeks ago became germany 's all time scoring leader , the german women have been routinely crushing the opposition at the 2005 european championships tournament in england over the past two weeks . german women steamroll into final on june 19 , tina theune-meyer 's team will take on norway in the final of the tournament .
up until now , germany had beaten its opening round opponents of france , italy and norway by an aggregate score of 8-0 .
in the semi-final against finland , they won 4-1 .
and theune-meyer had only one criticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer on her team letting in one goal during the whole tournament : " these things happen . "
" i wanted us to go the whole tournament without letting one in , " she said .
" those things happen . " led by a young attack of inka grings and conny pohlers , both of whom have scored three goals apiece in the tournament , germany has not had to rely on the game-turning abilities of prinz too often .
norway , on the other hand , has made a hard-fought trip into the finals , beating sweden 3-2 on an extra time goal in a thrilling semi-final on thursday .
the norwegians say they are ready for germany .
" we only have two days of rest to prepare to play the best team in the world , " said coach bjaren berntsen .
" although we will not use tiredness as an excuse . " soccer , a full time job germany 's dominance in england is merely a confirmation of their status as world-beaters in their sport .
and theune-meyer said sponsors are beginning to notice .
" they identify themselves with the attributes that make up women 's soccer : sassy , open and likeable , " she told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung ahead of the tournament .
" the players , through the live game coverage , have gotten popular … for many players , soccer is a full-time job . " in contrast to the us , where a successful , but short-lived women 's league folded in 2004 , germany 's women 's soccer league has slowly evolved into an established player on the german sporting scene .
aided by the success of prinz -lrb- photo -rrb- and company , women 's soccer is also one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade later , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa women 's soccer player of the year , birgit prinz , has been one of the reasons for soccer 's growing popularity among german girls .
global acceptance ? the fever is starting to get contagious .
the popular british movie " bend it like beckham , " about two women and their love for soccer scored big in the uk and the rest of europe .
a record 29,000 spectators showed up in manchester to watch england beat finland in the opening match of this year 's tournament . but for all its progress , the sport continues to struggle for the right kind of acceptance among some men , as illustrated by the president of uefa , european soccer 's governing body .
asked his thoughts on the future of women 's soccer , lennart johansson gave this response : " i think women 's football should turn to the sponsors , " he said .
" there are so many companies who could make use of the fact that if you see a girl playing on the ground , sweaty , with the rainy weather and coming out of the dressing-room , lovely-looking , that would sell .

it boasts the game 's leading scorer and two-time fifa world player of the year .
and now it finds itself on the cusp of winning yet another title . the women 's national team success in the past few years is something michael ballack , oliver kahn and co. can only dream about .
aside from the surprise second place showing at the last world cup , the men 's squad have had been mired in mediocrity since winning the european championships in 1998 . the women , on the other hand , have risen to challenge the united states as the premier women 's soccer side in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.06.2005 german girls discover the beautiful game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moment of victory for the german women at the 2003 world cup the success of the germany 's women 's soccer team internationally is rubbing off at home , with more girls playing the sport competitively .
but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .

but while acceptance among their male peers is growing , respect is lacking . german women started playing soccer professionally almost 40 years ago , and have since made their mark internationally , scooping the european championship several times , winning olympic bronze in sydney and athens , and taking the world championship in 2003 .
currently , the german women are in england playing for the european championship , and have already reached the semi-final . their success is inspiring increasing numbers of german girls to take up the sport .
at the local level , though , girls like 14-year-old lisann still have to play on boys ' teams .
she only gets to compete on an all-girls team at the regional level , but says generally , the boys on her hometown team have been accepting of her . " they think it 's cool .
in the beginning , they said ' oh , she 's bad ' but then they found out that girls can play soccer , too , " lisann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina wiegmann -lrb- r -rrb- and nia kuenze savor their triumphant return home bettina wiegmann , a key player in the german national team that won the world cup in 2003 , currently coaches an under-15 regional squad .
like lisann , she also started playing soccer on a boys ' team . " a lot has been achieved in women 's football , which is a good thing for the girls , " wiegmann said .
" we were the pioneers , we fought for the girls and now they have more opportunities . " the international success of the german national women 's team means , in theory at least , that the up-and-coming german girls should have plenty of role models to look up to .
but 14-year-old lorie confesses to idolizing a player of the opposite sex - none other than british star david beckham . " it 's not just because of his looks , " she says .
" it 's also because of how he plays - his free kicks and crosses and so on . " lorie is not unusual .
according to wiegmann , girls will continue to look up to male players as long as men 's soccer predominates in the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether it 's his looks or soccer prowess , david beckham is still the role model for many german girls " it 's not going to be any different in the near future because men 's soccer is there on television .
the girls look at the tricks and try to copy them , and it 's going to stay that way for the next couple of years , " wiegmann said . promising future despite this , women 's football has a promising future in germany , and is one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade on , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . women in the german soccer scene say that while today 's girls are benefiting from increased acceptance of their participation in what used to be an exclusively male sport , there is still a lack of respect from men and boys about the way women play . for lorie , the boys on her team can count themselves lucky that they 've had the experience of playing with a girl .

it boasts the game 's leading scorer and two-time fifa world player of the year .
and now it finds itself on the cusp of winning yet another title . the women 's national team success in the past few years is something michael ballack , oliver kahn and co. can only dream about .
aside from the surprise second place showing at the last world cup , the men 's squad have had been mired in mediocrity since winning the european championships in 1998 . the women , on the other hand , have risen to challenge the united states as the premier women 's soccer side in the world .
led by striker birgit prinz , who two weeks ago became germany 's all time scoring leader , the german women have been routinely crushing the opposition at the 2005 european championships tournament in england over the past two weeks . german women steamroll into final on june 19 , tina theune-meyer 's team will take on norway in the final of the tournament .
up until now , germany had beaten its opening round opponents of france , italy and norway by an aggregate score of 8-0 .

and theune-meyer had only one criticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer on her team letting in one goal during the whole tournament : " these things happen . "
" i wanted us to go the whole tournament without letting one in , " she said .

norway , on the other hand , has made a hard-fought trip into the finals , beating sweden 3-2 on an extra time goal in a thrilling semi-final on thursday .
the norwegians say they are ready for germany .
" we only have two days of rest to prepare to play the best team in the world , " said coach bjaren berntsen .
" although we will not use tiredness as an excuse . " soccer , a full time job germany 's dominance in england is merely a confirmation of their status as world-beaters in their sport .
and theune-meyer said sponsors are beginning to notice .
" they identify themselves with the attributes that make up women 's soccer : sassy , open and likeable , " she told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung ahead of the tournament .
" the players , through the live game coverage , have gotten popular … for many players , soccer is a full-time job . " in contrast to the us , where a successful , but short-lived women 's league folded in 2004 , germany 's women 's soccer league has slowly evolved into an established player on the german sporting scene .

european papers largely condemned the move , saying it was an expression of weakness . le figaro in paris described the delay as surrealistic .
" technically this means that the constitution will be put on ice for a year and a half in order to avoid burying it , " the paper wrote .
" basically , british pragmatism has won : ' it 's better to take a long break than widen the crisis . " ' vienna 's kurier called the decision " politically irresponsible and dangerous .
europe can not afford a standstill .
it 's also unwise to continue the ratifcation process - that 's like asking people to vote on a dead body . " milan 's corriere della sera saw europe smashed to pieces : " the french and dutch ' no ' to the constitution have set off an avalanche and the conflict between french president chirac and british premier blair over eu finances has added a further crisis .
under different circumstances , a compromise could have been found .
but what would have been easy in a healthy eu is almost impossible now . " rzeczpospolita in warsaw thought that europe 's leaders were simply clueless about how to go on .
" six or 12 extra months wo n't change anything , " the paper wrote .
" we 're certainly at the beginning of a long crisis for integration . "
but the daily added that the current situation might turn out to be a positive thing for the eu .
" the union does n't have a choice any more .
it can deal with its problems , but only if it becomes a world power whose citizens completely identify with it . " the cellesche zeitung in northern germany wrote that halting the ratification process was a wise move .
" it certainly is n't a sign for integration when the shock is so big that the opinions of the other country get ignored , " the paper wrote .
" they have to feel like second-class eu members .
new negotiations should only commence once all countries have voted .
not earlier . " and writing about britain 's refusal to give up a decade-old budget rebate and instead calling for an overall budget reform , the times of london said germany 's main opposition christian democrat leader angela merkel was a " useful ally , " saying her support for reform had " shown more leadership than most of the prime ministers gathered around the table in brussels .

and now it finds itself on the cusp of winning yet another title . the women 's national team success in the past few years is something michael ballack , oliver kahn and co. can only dream about .
aside from the surprise second place showing at the last world cup , the men 's squad have had been mired in mediocrity since winning the european championships in 1998 . the women , on the other hand , have risen to challenge the united states as the premier women 's soccer side in the world .
led by striker birgit prinz , who two weeks ago became germany 's all time scoring leader , the german women have been routinely crushing the opposition at the 2005 european championships tournament in england over the past two weeks . german women steamroll into final on june 19 , tina theune-meyer 's team will take on norway in the final of the tournament .
up until now , germany had beaten its opening round opponents of france , italy and norway by an aggregate score of 8-0 .
in the semi-final against finland , they won 4-1 .
and theune-meyer had only one criticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer on her team letting in one goal during the whole tournament : " these things happen . "
" i wanted us to go the whole tournament without letting one in , " she said .
" those things happen . " led by a young attack of inka grings and conny pohlers , both of whom have scored three goals apiece in the tournament , germany has not had to rely on the game-turning abilities of prinz too often .
norway , on the other hand , has made a hard-fought trip into the finals , beating sweden 3-2 on an extra time goal in a thrilling semi-final on thursday .
the norwegians say they are ready for germany .
" we only have two days of rest to prepare to play the best team in the world , " said coach bjaren berntsen .
" although we will not use tiredness as an excuse . " soccer , a full time job germany 's dominance in england is merely a confirmation of their status as world-beaters in their sport .
and theune-meyer said sponsors are beginning to notice .
" they identify themselves with the attributes that make up women 's soccer : sassy , open and likeable , " she told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung ahead of the tournament .
" the players , through the live game coverage , have gotten popular … for many players , soccer is a full-time job . " in contrast to the us , where a successful , but short-lived women 's league folded in 2004 , germany 's women 's soccer league has slowly evolved into an established player on the german sporting scene .
aided by the success of prinz -lrb- photo -rrb- and company , women 's soccer is also one of the country 's fastest growing sports .
in 1994 , the german football federation registered around 600,000 female players on 4,000 teams .
a decade later , the numbers have risen to 800,000 women playing on nearly 7,000 teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa women 's soccer player of the year , birgit prinz , has been one of the reasons for soccer 's growing popularity among german girls .
global acceptance ? the fever is starting to get contagious .
the popular british movie " bend it like beckham , " about two women and their love for soccer scored big in the uk and the rest of europe .
a record 29,000 spectators showed up in manchester to watch england beat finland in the opening match of this year 's tournament . but for all its progress , the sport continues to struggle for the right kind of acceptance among some men , as illustrated by the president of uefa , european soccer 's governing body .
asked his thoughts on the future of women 's soccer , lennart johansson gave this response : " i think women 's football should turn to the sponsors , " he said .
" there are so many companies who could make use of the fact that if you see a girl playing on the ground , sweaty , with the rainy weather and coming out of the dressing-room , lovely-looking , that would sell .

they can rely on health insurers to pick up the tab for their medical costs , while state-of-the-art therapies allow them to continue to lead practically normal lives . but judging by the applications for financial assistance submitted to the german aids foundation in recent years , a high number of aids sufferers in germany are , in fact , living on the poverty line .
since its inception in 1987 , the organization has been accepting donations - totalling 935,830 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in 2004 - which allow it to grant applicants anything from a new pair of winter boots to a new bed or even art materials , on the one condition that existing financial sources such as family and welfare support have been exhausted . a downward spiral last year , it fielded some 4000 applications .
" it might not sound like many , " said ulrich heide from the foundation committee .
" but given the relatively small number of people with the aids virus in this country - roughly 5000-6000 - we see it as a shockingly high number .
we believe that up to 50 percent of hiv positive people in germany are obliged to turn to our foundation for financial help . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foundation has also noticed that applicants for emergency funds are getting older . ten years ago , 80 percent of them were under 40 , whereas today , 50 percent are over 40 . according to the foundation , one factor in this shift is that hiv care has been revolutionized by new anti-retroviral drugs and people infected with the virus can live longer - but the problem is , they fast feel the pinch of having to live on a pittance . among the applicants are many aids patients who failed to pay into social security schemes for any length of time and who therefore have reduced eligibility for benefits .
hardest hit are women who either never worked , or worked part-time before their diagnosis . a rise in migrant poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another development the foundation has observed is that more and more migrant aids sufferers are living in tight financial circumstances . " as well as the increase in older and female applicants , we 've seen that one third of applicants are now migrants , " said heide .
" many come from eastern europe , and there are also high numbers from countries where aids has reached epidemic proportions , such as southern africa and sub-saharan africa , south-east asia and also the far east . " the private foundation 's original mandate was to care for people infected with the hiv virus in germany alone .
but in 1999 , it also turned its attention to overseas projects , primarily in africa . " we ca n't build walls " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these is the hope outreach programm in cape town , which concentrates on medical aid and educational work .
the project was set up by reverend stefan hippler and would never have seen the light of day without subsidies provided by the german aids foundation . " the cooperation is a financial one , which means a lot to us , " explained hippler .
" but it 's also based in an exchange of expertise and experience . " ulrich heide stresses that there are many advantages to branching out with projects abroad . " the center of our activity will always be germany , " he said .

the result is a glowing homage to istanbul 's music scene . akin had been dreaming of this film for a long time .
the shooting for his award-winning drama " head on , " which partly took place in istanbul , is what gave him the final impulse .
together with alexander hacke , the bass player of the german avant-garde band " einstürzende neubauten , " akin returned to the turkish cultural capital to find out what makes istanbul a city of dreams and love songs , and above all , a musical metropolis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hacke on his musical search in istanbul kitted out with a laptop and hi-tech equipment , the two men made their way through the loud , hectic and hot city in order to portray the musicians that lend istanbul its musical identity .
a turkish music medley what they came up with is a medley of many different musical directions , oscillating between hip hop and arabesque , turkish grunge and roma folklore , electro beats and melancholy street music .
unobtrusively and yet with a close-up view , akin follows the musicians and the film 's narrator , alexander hacke , through the narrow streets of istanbul , into the studios , on a boat trip .
no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .
there 's rapper ceza , for example , whose quick-rapping songs are reminiscent of sean combs , aka p. diddy .
but ceza would reject any comparison with american role models . bildunterschrift : ceza and his gang " knowing where you live gives you music and identity , " says the young musician .

flower power and 1001 nights the rather surprising support offered by the older generation did not exist in the 1960s and 70s for the eccentric musician erkin koray .
he was one of the first to play turkish music on electrically amplified instruments , to cover the beatles and the stones , and to inaugurate the beat era in turkey . with this kind of western influence , he faced rejection in the turkish republic , but for the next generation , he had opened the door to a new understanding of music .
and for this he is still a role model today .
the same is true for bands like " baba zula , " who play a mixture of oriental sounds and jazz-oriented psychedelic , thereby expressing the notion that istanbul is neither in the east nor west , but is made up of different ethnic influences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's why in akin 's film , the band does n't play in istanbul but on a traditional ship on the bosporus , the strip of sea that separates asia from europe .
for the " baba zula " musicians , the borders are fluid in the most literal sense .
the freedom of identity the title of akin 's film , " crossing the bridge , " thus has many meanings .
it 's not just about a bridge between east and west , islam and christianity .
in the world of music , these definitions do not exist .
one of the musicians portrayed in the film puts it like this : " i do n't believe that asia begins at the bosporus and ends in china and the west begins in greece and stretches to los angeles . "

no fancy camera scenes , no staged drama take away from the film 's musical core .
but " crossing the bridge – the sounds of istanbul " is not just a survey of the city 's music scene .
it is a documentary film in which the musicians and their understanding of music and their identity play the main role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 17.06.2005 eu constitution gets time for reflection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels votes to extend ratification process on the constitution late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .
while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future . although the decision to push back the deadline for ratification of the european constitution does little to mend the crisis that arose in the bloc after france and the netherlands voted against it in national referenda , many in brussels hope the one-year delay will give the 25 member states more time to explain the document and the eu 's goals to their citizens . the process of ratifying the document in all current member states was slated to be completed by nov .
1 , 2006 .
so far only a handful of countries have actually ratified it , either through referenda or parliament votes .
in may and june , voters in france and the netherlands voted against the constitution , whereas britain opted to postpone a referendum , knowing it would most certainly fail .
in germany , the constitution was approved by both houses of parliament , but president horst köhler announced wednesday that he would halt ratification pending a court appeal . in the days and weeks running up to the mid-year summit in brussels , european leaders and officials in brussels spent a good deal of diplomatic effort worrying about the future of europe 's first constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 members before it can go into force .
many had recommended postponing the process , while others such as german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac lobbied hard to stick to the course and allow all countries to have their say . sigh of relief bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , right , meets luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker in luxembourg , tuesday june 14 , 2005 then at around midnight thursday after a day of debate , a sigh of relief went out when luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker -lrb- photo , with tony blair -rrb- told reporters that the process of ratifying the document was now on hold . " we believe that the constitutional treaty has the answers to many questions that europeans are asking , so we believe the ratification process must continue .
there will not be a better treaty .
the date of nov .
1 , 2006 to conclude the ratification process is no longer valid .
that means giving ourselves more time , " said junker , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states endorsed the decision to suspend the ratification process until at least next year to allow for a " period of reflection " in which they will discuss the future direction of europe , including enlarging the bloc . " we are going to need a period of reflection , not only in the netherlands but in other countries , " dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said .
" we have to find answers to questions about national sovereignty and about financial matters " of the eu , which were two issues that caused the dutch to vote against the constitution in a referendum earlier this month , he added . more dialogue with people bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for education and culture , viviane reding .
according to eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding -lrb- photo -rrb- , postponing the ratification process offers a good opportunity for member states to return to their people and explain the content of the constitution .
in an interview with dw-world.de , reding said the constitution is still alive , but in the referenda it became clear that " people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments . " " it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way , " she said , adding that conveying information is key to the charter 's success and the future of europe . " i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition , " she said . " many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries , " reding explained . eu 's future course the eu has sought to reassure aspiring candidates that its door remains open after france warned that the 25-member bloc 's constitutional crisis raises questions about its plans to expand . french president chirac said he had doubts about the future expansion plans to allow bulgaria , romania and possibly croatia and turkey to enter the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " despite such concerns , eu leaders pledged to honor their commitments to countries in line to join the bloc , in draft conclusions from their summit obtained by afp on friday . in the text , the leaders welcomed the signature of an accession treaty on april 25 , which they said marks an important new step toward bulgaria and romania 's membership of the eu in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?

many of the walkers have been touched in some way by the disease , like a group of friends who are taking part after emily stevenson , from battersea , south london , was diagnosed with breast cancer aged just 29 .
my boyfriend found a lump in my breast when we were on holiday in rome .
i felt complete and utter shock ... you feel as if your life collapses around you ... like it has completely stopped emily stevenson bra walk founder 's giant steps it 's one of those things a woman does n't want to hear , so i pretty much dismissed it until a week later when i felt it myself and panicked .
my gp was really reassuring and told me cancer was uncommon in a woman my age .
he said at worst it might be a benign lump but i should go for a check up .
i had private medical care and only had to wait two days for an appointment instead of three to four weeks .
it 's lucky that was the case because i found out i had a very aggressive form of cancer which would have got much , much worse had i waited .
' i knew i had cancer ' at the hospital i knew something was wrong because the nurse told me it definitely was n't a cyst and i was sent for a biopsy .
it never crossed my mind that it could be cancer , i was convinced it was something else .
two days later i went back for the results .
i walked into the room and there was a macmillan nurse i had met before .
i knew as soon as i saw her i had breast cancer .
i felt complete and utter shock .
you feel as if your life collapses around you .
like it has completely stopped .
i could n't imagine there would ever be a time when i would come to terms with it .
miss stevenson said it was hard to find sufferers of a similar age and then being told i would have to have chemotherapy , all i could think about was the hair loss .
i did n't deal with it very well , but luckily my boyfriend was a calming influence .
i actually thought he would run a mile .
but he did n't - neither did my friends .
the only way i can describe it is like being on a rollercoaster , which you have no idea how you are going to deal with .
i do n't think i took it all in for a long time and i over-compensated , tried to get on with my life , more so than before and over did it .
i think i had a moment of clarity after my operation a few weeks later .
i thought ' i have n't lost my breast , it does n't look that bad and my scar is n't as big as i thought it would be ' .
side-effects of treatment then when chemo started i was back on the rollercoaster .
i thought about losing my hair and began thinking my friends would n't want to be around me .
it was hard to control my emotions .
being my age none of my friends had experienced anything like this , they could talk about older women , their mums or grandmas , but no-one my age .
i have a very active social life and i wanted someone to tell me if i could still go out with my friends , to pubs and clubs and parties .
but there was no-one .
the worst thing was losing my hair .
it sounds odd but i think if i had kept it i would have found it easier to cope with the other side-effects of chemo like the depression and infections .
i would lock myself in my room with the curtains closed and it was n't until the end of chemo that i 'd really learnt to cope .
it 's -lrb- the moonwalk -rrb- a way women can come together to do something without having to talk about what your friends , wives or relatives have gone through emily stevenson i do n't want this to come across as a negative story , like so much of the literature i have read , because my life has changed .
i 've given up work and have gone travelling around the world with my boyfriend .
i am waiting for someone to turn around and say ' it 's not coming back ' , but they ca n't just yet .
i have to have check-ups every three months and i am still on drugs which aim to stop the cancer coming back .
' live your life ' but when you 've been through an experience like this returning to the normal routine does n't sit comfortably .
my friends did n't take much persuading to do the moonwalk .
they 've been through it all with me and i think they wanted to do something positive , although i do n't think they 've quite realised what they 've taken on .
it 's a way women can come together to do something without having to talk about what your friends , wives or relatives have gone through .
my first milestone will be two years clear , then five then 10 , but i 'm not even going to think about that until i get there .
it 's going to be hard , but you 've just got to live your life .
all funds raised by walk the walk 's playtex moonwalk go to breast cancer research and care .

that has cleared the way for a £ 7.4bn -lrb- $ 13.5bn -rrb- takeover from pernod ricard of france and fortune brands of the us .
the uk 's takeover watchdog had given constellation until 29 june to table a counter offer .
constellation was thought to be eyeing allied 's wines business , which includes mumm and perrier-jouet champagne .
' careful consideration ' the us owner of the mondavi and brl hardy wine brands surprised markets in april when it said it had entered into " preliminary " talks with allied domecq .
allied had already accepted the friendly takeover approach from pernod and would have had to pay the french firm millions of pounds in compensation had it pulled out of the deal .
the lure of allied 's brands did not prove attractive enough for constellation , however .
" simply put , careful consideration and evaluation of the details following due diligence did not identify sufficient value for submitting an offer , " said constellation 's chairman and chief executive richard sands .
constellation was considering bidding in partnership with jack daniel 's maker brown-forman and private equity groups lion capital and blackstone group .
allied 's other brands include malibu rum , beefeater gin and courvoisier cognac .

the money , which has been generated from landfill taxes , has been awarded by environmental charity grantscape .
last year , the garden was saved from serious financial problems when it was given a rescue package of over £ 1m .
dr rhodri griffiths , general manager at the garden said the new grant was " excellent news " .
" this is a superb example of the private and public sectors working together to ensure a bright future for our national botanic garden , " said dr griffiths .
" this shows the confidence the private sector has in the garden 's importance as a national asset .
" the garden is really blooming , visitor numbers are up , all financial targets are being exceeded and these grants are an integral part of our success . "
it is not the first grant given to the garden from grantscape , which aims to help fund projects with benefit to the local environment .
other awards included £ 265,000 which was used to provide environmentally sustainable treatment of waste water from the site and another grant of £ 400,000 which was also used at the double walled garden .
grantscape 's steven hargreaves said it was " proud " to be able to award the money .
the garden , which cost more than £ 40m to set up , hit financial difficulties in the years after it opened in 2000 , and risked closure in the winter of 2003-4 .
carmarthenshire county council , the millennium commission and the welsh assembly government all contributed to the package which helped save it , and it has now celebrated its fifth birthday .

in 2000 in iran , for instance , the regime shut down almost all independent newspapers .

they had information that the journalists did n't .

groups , such as the committee to protect bloggers , have been set up to rally global blogger support for those who are repressed for what they say .
english bias there is no doubt blogs have caused ripples across the net .
many people are confused about why blogs have exploded in the way they have .
" blogs make things so much easier for non-technical people to publish .
anyone can be a publisher now , " explained mr pain .
iranians use blogs as the only source of free information " the real difference is that it is really easy for everyday people to do it .
that is a revolution .
everyone can take the opportunity to be online publishers and speak out .
" we are talking about 50-year-old iranian journalists with no html skills , who would not be able to do real website .
the real problem , he said , was that the main blog tools that make self-publishing easy tended to be anglo-saxon and english-language based .
blogging took off in iran when hossein derakhshan , who blogs under the name hoder , integrated farsi into blogging tools .
" iranians want to talk first to iranians , then the rest of the world , " said mr pain .
but mr derakhshan does not live in iran anymore , and now publishes in english .
rsf said it was important for people still in countries like iran to blog and reach out to and inform people who speak their own language .
rsf is trying to help bloggers set up their sites in nepalese , for instance .
they are having enormous difficulties because the blogging tools are just not able to handle the kinds of characters used in nepalese .
mr pain said rsf that working with organisations like civiblog , which describes itself as a blogging tool for the " global civil society " , could help alleviate the problem .
china is the most sophisticated in terms of web censoring tools and systems in place .
