the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .
for many , it 's a long-overdue move .
" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .
müller pointed to scandinavia as an example where letter monopolies have been absent for some years , saying increased competition would not pose problems for either deutsche post or germany at large . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post faces red-letter days on monday deutsche post was ordered to cease actions that limited competition in the pre-sorting business .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .

angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar germany 's federal commissioner of data protection , peter schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- , has argued that visible police presence would be more effective than more cameras .
we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " schaar told dw-world .
" even if an area is watched by video -lrb- that -rrb- does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .

angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar germany 's federal commissioner of data protection , peter schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- , has argued that visible police presence would be more effective than more cameras .
we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " schaar told dw-world .
" even if an area is watched by video -lrb- that -rrb- does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes . "
others have voiced concerns over the financial costs and the sensitive issue of data protection .
" despite the success of their manhunts , the british have now sobered up because the financial cost of blanket video surveillance is enormous , " christian pfeiffer of the criminology institute of the state of lower saxony told spiegel online .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .

" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .

bremen , hamburg and schalke are all chasing bayern , which is hoping to expand its early season lead . it 'll only be the fourth match day for germany 's top-flight soccer league this season , and already everybody is trying to catch fc bayern münchen .
but the defending champions are currently only two points clear of three teams that have serious title ambitions this year : werder bremen , hamburg sv , and schalke 04 .
all four clubs will be playing away this weekend , increasing the competition to come out on top .
bayern will travel to bavarian rivals 1 .
fc nürnberg , bremen heads to 1 .
fc kaiserslautern , hamburg will take on 1 .
fsv mainz 05 and schalke will go to bayern leverkusen .
bavarian derby all of those match-ups are manageable for the visitors and bayern in particular will have the motivation to show struggling nürnberg who 's boss .
if bayern win , it will be the team 's 13th consecutive victory , breaking a 24-year-old bundesliga record .
munich has won half of all the bavarian derby held in nuremberg , which will be hard pressed to keep the defending champions from at least taking a point home with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart hamburg sv will have a harder time against mainz , which won their first bundesliga points by beating the northern club after being promoted to the top-flight .
but hamburg , with a strengthened squad and new ambition , has been in impressive form early this season .
hsv 's new dutch star rafael van der vaart will almost certainly be raring to go after having a great match with his national side at the weekend .
mainz , on the other hand , is wallowing at the bottom of the table .

bremen , hamburg and schalke are all chasing bayern , which is hoping to expand its early season lead . it 'll only be the fourth match day for germany 's top-flight soccer league this season , and already everybody is trying to catch fc bayern münchen .
but the defending champions are currently only two points clear of three teams that have serious title ambitions this year : werder bremen , hamburg sv , and schalke 04 .
all four clubs will be playing away this weekend , increasing the competition to come out on top .
bayern will travel to bavarian rivals 1 .
fc nürnberg , bremen heads to 1 .
fc kaiserslautern , hamburg will take on 1 .
fsv mainz 05 and schalke will go to bayern leverkusen .
bavarian derby all of those match-ups are manageable for the visitors and bayern in particular will have the motivation to show struggling nürnberg who 's boss .
if bayern win , it will be the team 's 13th consecutive victory , breaking a 24-year-old bundesliga record .
munich has won half of all the bavarian derby held in nuremberg , which will be hard pressed to keep the defending champions from at least taking a point home with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart hamburg sv will have a harder time against mainz , which won their first bundesliga points by beating the northern club after being promoted to the top-flight .
but hamburg , with a strengthened squad and new ambition , has been in impressive form early this season .
hsv 's new dutch star rafael van der vaart will almost certainly be raring to go after having a great match with his national side at the weekend .
mainz , on the other hand , is wallowing at the bottom of the table .
but the club has taken new hope from the arrival of egyptian striker mohamed zidan on loan from bremen .
" i will show what i can do , " zidan said confidently after throwing his lot in with mainz .
bremen aims high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keyplayer saison 2005/06 werder bremen thorsten frings bremen certainly does n't seem to miss him at the moment as they prepare to head to kaiserslautern .
midfielder torsten frings has returned from injury and he knows his squad needs to get the away points to avoid falling too far behind his old club bayern .
" we have to win if we want to stay put up top , " he said .
bremen is undefeated since losing 0-1 to dortmund on may 8 last season .
their victory against kaiserslautern on may 21 punched bremen 's ticket to the champions league this year .
the last match for the top four clubs is schalke 04 visiting bayern leverkusen .
normally , leverkusen would be a tough nut to crack at home , but at the moment , the club is suffering a number of injuries .
to make things worse , roque junior and marko babic are both suspended due to red cards .
schalke 's brazilian playmaker lincoln will also be rejoining his side after his own suspension for spitting in the german cup final in august .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .

but , as expected , sommer stopped short of endorsing the spd for the election .
schröder said he and sommer were united in their opposition to merkel 's proposal to cut tax exemptions on bonuses for working nights and weekends and benefits for commuters . workers know what 's good for them " workers know where they are hard-pressed and who is doing what , " sommer said of the competing election platforms .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .

a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .
" the hurricane comes at a moment where our relations are back on track and excellent as they should be . " a reallocation of priorities simon serfaty , an expert on european affairs at the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- in washington said though he did not feel the hurricane and its aftermath could have a direct impact on transatlantic ties , it could have a ripple effect . he said the unfolding domestic debate between democrats and republicans on the handling of the disaster may force president george w. bush to reassess his priorities and change his agenda , thus affecting his foreign policy . " how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .
" the reallocation of priorities is very important , because this would in fact be done possibly at the expense of some of the us role in the world .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .

" waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .
six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas . " glass 's music is very harmonic and very listenable , " montavon said . bildunterschrift : the sets for " waiting for the barbarians " are by george tsypin allegory of the iraq war the composer sees the work as a criticism of the iraq war led by us president george w. bush - something that made it all the more surprising for glass when the opera was invited to hold its us premiere in austin , texas in january 2007 . " we were very surprised by the invitation " , he told germany 's dpa news agency . " but austin is n't texas , " he said , adding that bush 's policies were not as hotly disputed now as during the height of the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt theater opened in 2003 glass praised the erfurt theater for staging the work and for its commitment to contemporary music theater in general . he also lauded the theater 's musical standards , noting that the chorus and orchestra were able to recreate his sound world without any difficulty . " this sort of openness is not always found in other opera houses , " he said . ambitious project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern erfurt theater cost 60 million euros to complete erfurt managed to entice us maestro dennis russell davies - who has conducted many glass premieres - for the production . " he is the best midwife for my pieces , " the composer said . the sets are by russian theater designer , george tsypin , and the costumes are by german designer hank irwin kittel . glass said he likes to maintain links with opera houses that have performed his works and he could imagine returning to erfurt in the future . opened in september 2003 , the erfurt theater took four years to build .
it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

" waiting for the barbarians " premieres on saturday in the eastern german town of erfurt . erfurt , a small city in the eastern german state of thuringia , will put itself on the world opera map this week with the premiere of a new work by american minimalist composer philip glass . " waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .
six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas . " glass 's music is very harmonic and very listenable , " montavon said . bildunterschrift : the sets for " waiting for the barbarians " are by george tsypin allegory of the iraq war the composer sees the work as a criticism of the iraq war led by us president george w. bush - something that made it all the more surprising for glass when the opera was invited to hold its us premiere in austin , texas in january 2007 . " we were very surprised by the invitation " , he told germany 's dpa news agency . " but austin is n't texas , " he said , adding that bush 's policies were not as hotly disputed now as during the height of the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt theater opened in 2003 glass praised the erfurt theater for staging the work and for its commitment to contemporary music theater in general . he also lauded the theater 's musical standards , noting that the chorus and orchestra were able to recreate his sound world without any difficulty . " this sort of openness is not always found in other opera houses , " he said . ambitious project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern erfurt theater cost 60 million euros to complete erfurt managed to entice us maestro dennis russell davies - who has conducted many glass premieres - for the production . " he is the best midwife for my pieces , " the composer said . the sets are by russian theater designer , george tsypin , and the costumes are by german designer hank irwin kittel . glass said he likes to maintain links with opera houses that have performed his works and he could imagine returning to erfurt in the future . opened in september 2003 , the erfurt theater took four years to build .
it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

a third of 40-year-old women do not have children , causing politicians campaigning in germany 's election to push for a teutonic baby boom . chancellor gerhard schröder has made boosting a birthrate that is among the lowest in europe one of the key pledges of an election campaign focused on reviving germany 's moribund economy . his conservative challenger angela merkel , who looks set to become germany 's first woman chancellor , has promised a " better future for families " and financial help for parents until their children are 12 years old . if their policies differ in the detail , the right and the left both hope to breathe new life into an ageing society and avoid a future of too many pensioners and too few young earners . well-meaning but ineffective in 2004 , the average german woman had only 1.3 children , and projections show that by 2050 , a third of the population will be over the age of 60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning on a platform of children analysts say that if the incentives promised by the politicians are well-meaning , it is unlikely that they could rapidly reverse a demographic trend that has been decades in the making . they forecast that in the future almost half of those with a university education will never have children , in a country where the average life expectancy is around 76 for men and 82 for women . president horst koehler sounded the alarm in july when he gave the go-ahead for elections 12 months ahead of schedule , warning : " we have too few children and we are getting older and older . " family policy to make no difference yet the focus on family in the campaign seems to have almost no influence on how germans will vote on september 18 , according to klaus-peter schoeppner , the head of the emnid polling institute . " family policy is not expected to make any difference to the election results .
the vote is dominated by concerns about the labour market , more so still than the last one in 2002 , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has no children herself .
merkel 's christian democrats wish to preserve " the traditional family model " while schröder 's social democrats want to make life easier for working mothers and plan to create 230,000 new places in pre-schools by 2010 . the current government 's family minister , renate schmidt , has proposed new payments for parents who take time off work to care for a baby of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,230 -rrb- per month , until the child 's first birthday . the plan has been described as " impossible to finance " by ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven who is considered as childless merkel 's likely choice of family minister should she win the election . instead the conservatives are promising tax breaks for parents as well as a reduction of their monthly contributions towards the state pension funds . " financial incentives are not enough , " said josef schmid , a lecturer at the university of bamberg in southern germany .
" we need more pre-schools like there are in france , greater measures to make it easier for women to combine children with a career and more stable couples . " appreciation of children missing in a study by the federal demographics institute , 83 percent of those questioned said their main reason for not having children was the lack of a stable relationship .
some 60 percent also said they were too worried about what the future held to bring children into the world . the german press has remarked that perhaps what is missing is a general appreciation of children , not constant reminders that every newborn will eventually be a consumer and taxpayer . after all , the newspapers have said , the natural and somewhat obscure longing to have a child has little to do with state subsidies and labor market structures . " nobody wants to say out loud what is really happening , " retired demographics professor herwig birg said . he said the incentives to make more german babies have come " too late " and the ageing nature of the population has become " impossible to reverse " . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the birth-rate problem sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems .

" i ca n't imagine that a decision would be made in four weeks , " she told reporters as she arrived at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in newcastle , northern england . the member states committed themselves to reaching an agreement on the issue by october , following the bombings in london on july 7 , in which 52 commuters were killed during the morning rush hour . weighing security against the costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries believes more time is needed for an eu-wide agreement zypries said that several questions about the controversial measures remained unanswered , such as who will foot the potentially massive bill for keeping records on calls and e-mail for up to a year . " for german companies , it would cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 124 million -rrb- .
either the state will pay for it or the consumers .
in the end , you have to weigh security against the costs , " she said . the deal , according to a project presented last year by britain , france , ireland and sweden , would affect a wide range of equipment including land line and mobile telephones , text messages , e-mails and internet protocols . extending legal boundaries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberty advocates are worried about privacy intrusions the main thrust of it is that telecom operators would keep , generally for a year , information concerning the sender , receiver , time , place and length of any communication but not a record of the conversation or message itself .
internet data would be retained for six months . the ministers also want records of calls that went unanswered to be included .
those details were vital for spanish police investigating the madrid bombings in march 2004 . the plan allows , however , a certain degree of flexibility in applying the rules . " we could not go beyond six months because we are bound by the decision of our parliament " on retaining data , said zypries .
german firms usually keep such information for three to six months for billing purposes . german interior minister otto schily said that he would be willing to try to push that period out to a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the high cost of security terrorism could pose a serious threat to world business , according to german trade group bga .

in africa , the last day of world cup qualifiers will be both joyful and agonizing .
so far , only one of five teams can safely book its hotel rooms in germany . the past week has shown just how quickly a coach 's fate can be turned upside down .
german coach jürgen klinsmann sowed abuse after his team 's dismal performance in bratislava last saturday .
but with the reinstatement of young striker lukas podolski into the starting lineup against south africa on wednesday and the ensuing 4-2 victory , the calls for his head quieted .
fortunately for klinsmann , germany automatically qualifies for next year 's world cup as host .
not so for england .
coach sven-goran eriksson was well on his way to leading his side to direct qualification for the tournament just ten days ago .
but a less than stellar performance against wales that ended in a narrow 1-0 win against neighbor wales was topped by a stunning 1-0 defeat at the hands of northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's coach sven goran eriksson is in the crossfire of criticism a team england had not lost to since 1927 .
the reactions in the english press were quick and merciless .
" worst defeat in over 50 years " screamed the daily mirror .
the tabloid the sun was more direct - fire eriksson .
and english fans who accompanied the team to belfast sang " sack the swede . "
tactical mistakes not only the loss to minnows northern ireland left a bitter aftertaste , but also how it happened .
the tactics of eriksson have come under increasing criticism within the english football association .
" there 's no form , no pattern to the team 's play , " one senior fa man told the daily telegraph .
" where 's the pride ?
sven 's got to sort the bloody thing out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all is well with wayne rooney who is suspended for next qualifier leaving striker michael owen alone to fend for himself with five supporting midfielders , including true forward wayne rooney , has left many a soccer fans and critics scratching their heads .

but that is easier said than done as england must beat austria , third place in the group , and poland , group six leaders .
four african slots up for grabs this weekend , the final four of the five african teams will be determined .
ghana is the only nation practically assured of qualifying for germany 2006 after getting help from burkina faso who beat south africa .
only an improbable chain of events would force them to alter their plans for next june .
in group one , togo and senegal lie at the top on 20 and 18 points respectively .
it wo n't be until sunday that the group winner is clear .
senegal can seize the lead they beat zambia on friday .
togo must travel to brazzaville to play congo on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon -lrb- in green -rrb- against germany last november cameroon 's indomitable lions made a spectacular comeback in abidjan to beat nearest competitors ivory coast 3-2 last weekend .
the lions can assure themselves a spot on sunday by winning against egypt .
should the ivory coast lose to sudan on friday however , then achille webo , who scored a hat-trick against ivory coast will become an instant national hero .
old standbys nigeria hope to appear in their fourth world cup in a row but need some help .
they are even on points with angola , but because the angolans have a better head-to-head record , the eagles will have be clear on points to qualify .
this may be wishful thinking because angola face last-place rwanda on sunday .
finally , confederations cup participant tunisia and group five leader hook up with second-place morocco on saturday in tunis .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .

the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .

" i ca n't imagine that a decision would be made in four weeks , " she told reporters as she arrived at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in newcastle , northern england . the member states committed themselves to reaching an agreement on the issue by october , following the bombings in london on july 7 , in which 52 commuters were killed during the morning rush hour . weighing security against the costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries believes more time is needed for an eu-wide agreement zypries said that several questions about the controversial measures remained unanswered , such as who will foot the potentially massive bill for keeping records on calls and e-mail for up to a year . " for german companies , it would cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 124 million -rrb- .
either the state will pay for it or the consumers .
in the end , you have to weigh security against the costs , " she said . the deal , according to a project presented last year by britain , france , ireland and sweden , would affect a wide range of equipment including land line and mobile telephones , text messages , e-mails and internet protocols . extending legal boundaries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberty advocates are worried about privacy intrusions the main thrust of it is that telecom operators would keep , generally for a year , information concerning the sender , receiver , time , place and length of any communication but not a record of the conversation or message itself .
internet data would be retained for six months . the ministers also want records of calls that went unanswered to be included .
those details were vital for spanish police investigating the madrid bombings in march 2004 . the plan allows , however , a certain degree of flexibility in applying the rules . " we could not go beyond six months because we are bound by the decision of our parliament " on retaining data , said zypries .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .
" the hurricane comes at a moment where our relations are back on track and excellent as they should be . " a reallocation of priorities simon serfaty , an expert on european affairs at the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- in washington said though he did not feel the hurricane and its aftermath could have a direct impact on transatlantic ties , it could have a ripple effect . he said the unfolding domestic debate between democrats and republicans on the handling of the disaster may force president george w. bush to reassess his priorities and change his agenda , thus affecting his foreign policy . " how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .
" the reallocation of priorities is very important , because this would in fact be done possibly at the expense of some of the us role in the world .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .
for many , it 's a long-overdue move .
" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .
müller pointed to scandinavia as an example where letter monopolies have been absent for some years , saying increased competition would not pose problems for either deutsche post or germany at large . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post faces red-letter days on monday deutsche post was ordered to cease actions that limited competition in the pre-sorting business .

boeing-707 jets from a small fleet of nato aircraft will deliver smaller aid items . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief says decision easy " this decision was an easy one , because no other answer could have been possible , " nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting .
" it shows that the nato alliance is ... ready to do its part in the diminishing of the human suffering - which is so huge . " nato officials said aircraft could be sent in a few days but the ships providing the bulk of the supplies will take longer take a minimum of two weeks . more than 90 countries helping u.s. ambassador to nato victoria nuland expressed gratitude for allies ' support " to help ensure that the enormous outpouring of humanitarian offers ... can get to those in need quickly . " in all , more than 90 countries have offered services or equipment and aid to us authorities , who are seeking to manage the influx of foreign help amid the devastation wreaked by the hurricane on the gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union , which groups many of the same countries as nato , has also stepped up to the plate to help us authorities deal with the consequences of hurricane katrina .
the united states on sunday officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other supplies for the victims of hurricane katrina , said the european commission . logistical problems preventing aid some european officials have cited logistical problems in getting aid to its destinations .
for example , one swedish plane full of supplies was kept waiting this week because it lacked approval to land in the united states . us president george w. bush , who has been heavily criticized for his handling of the catastrophe , initially refused foreign aid but reversed that stance faced with the scale of the disaster . earlier this week the us state department said that washington had already been offered one billion dollars ' worth of assistance from some 45 countries .
the last time the united states called for nato help was in 2002 when alliance surveillance planes were used to monitor the skies over the salt lake city olympic games . before that , in the first time in its history , nato dispatched the awacs planes to help guard us airspace after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can katrina help mend transatlantic ties ?

" waiting for the barbarians " premieres on saturday in the eastern german town of erfurt . erfurt , a small city in the eastern german state of thuringia , will put itself on the world opera map this week with the premiere of a new work by american minimalist composer philip glass . " waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .
six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas . " glass 's music is very harmonic and very listenable , " montavon said . bildunterschrift : the sets for " waiting for the barbarians " are by george tsypin allegory of the iraq war the composer sees the work as a criticism of the iraq war led by us president george w. bush - something that made it all the more surprising for glass when the opera was invited to hold its us premiere in austin , texas in january 2007 . " we were very surprised by the invitation " , he told germany 's dpa news agency . " but austin is n't texas , " he said , adding that bush 's policies were not as hotly disputed now as during the height of the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt theater opened in 2003 glass praised the erfurt theater for staging the work and for its commitment to contemporary music theater in general . he also lauded the theater 's musical standards , noting that the chorus and orchestra were able to recreate his sound world without any difficulty . " this sort of openness is not always found in other opera houses , " he said . ambitious project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern erfurt theater cost 60 million euros to complete erfurt managed to entice us maestro dennis russell davies - who has conducted many glass premieres - for the production . " he is the best midwife for my pieces , " the composer said . the sets are by russian theater designer , george tsypin , and the costumes are by german designer hank irwin kittel . glass said he likes to maintain links with opera houses that have performed his works and he could imagine returning to erfurt in the future . opened in september 2003 , the erfurt theater took four years to build .
it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .
" there 's a lot of movement , everything is possible , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's economic woes and the election whoever wins the general election on sept .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties .

" i ca n't imagine that a decision would be made in four weeks , " she told reporters as she arrived at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in newcastle , northern england . the member states committed themselves to reaching an agreement on the issue by october , following the bombings in london on july 7 , in which 52 commuters were killed during the morning rush hour . weighing security against the costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries believes more time is needed for an eu-wide agreement zypries said that several questions about the controversial measures remained unanswered , such as who will foot the potentially massive bill for keeping records on calls and e-mail for up to a year . " for german companies , it would cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 124 million -rrb- .
either the state will pay for it or the consumers .
in the end , you have to weigh security against the costs , " she said . the deal , according to a project presented last year by britain , france , ireland and sweden , would affect a wide range of equipment including land line and mobile telephones , text messages , e-mails and internet protocols . extending legal boundaries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberty advocates are worried about privacy intrusions the main thrust of it is that telecom operators would keep , generally for a year , information concerning the sender , receiver , time , place and length of any communication but not a record of the conversation or message itself .
internet data would be retained for six months . the ministers also want records of calls that went unanswered to be included .
those details were vital for spanish police investigating the madrid bombings in march 2004 . the plan allows , however , a certain degree of flexibility in applying the rules . " we could not go beyond six months because we are bound by the decision of our parliament " on retaining data , said zypries .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .
for many , it 's a long-overdue move .
" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .
müller pointed to scandinavia as an example where letter monopolies have been absent for some years , saying increased competition would not pose problems for either deutsche post or germany at large . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post faces red-letter days on monday deutsche post was ordered to cease actions that limited competition in the pre-sorting business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.09.2005 nato approves aid for katrina relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries have pledged to help the us how they can nato on friday approved a us request for it to play a bigger role in transporting and coordinating european aid for the victims of hurricane katrina . ambassadors from the transatlantic alliance 's 26 member states approved measures in an emergency meeting friday including up to three ships with a capacity equivalent to around 600 long trucks for bulky equipment .
boeing-707 jets from a small fleet of nato aircraft will deliver smaller aid items . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief says decision easy " this decision was an easy one , because no other answer could have been possible , " nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting .
" it shows that the nato alliance is ... ready to do its part in the diminishing of the human suffering - which is so huge . " nato officials said aircraft could be sent in a few days but the ships providing the bulk of the supplies will take longer take a minimum of two weeks . more than 90 countries helping u.s. ambassador to nato victoria nuland expressed gratitude for allies ' support " to help ensure that the enormous outpouring of humanitarian offers ... can get to those in need quickly . " in all , more than 90 countries have offered services or equipment and aid to us authorities , who are seeking to manage the influx of foreign help amid the devastation wreaked by the hurricane on the gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union , which groups many of the same countries as nato , has also stepped up to the plate to help us authorities deal with the consequences of hurricane katrina .
the united states on sunday officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other supplies for the victims of hurricane katrina , said the european commission . logistical problems preventing aid some european officials have cited logistical problems in getting aid to its destinations .
for example , one swedish plane full of supplies was kept waiting this week because it lacked approval to land in the united states . us president george w. bush , who has been heavily criticized for his handling of the catastrophe , initially refused foreign aid but reversed that stance faced with the scale of the disaster . earlier this week the us state department said that washington had already been offered one billion dollars ' worth of assistance from some 45 countries .
the last time the united states called for nato help was in 2002 when alliance surveillance planes were used to monitor the skies over the salt lake city olympic games . before that , in the first time in its history , nato dispatched the awacs planes to help guard us airspace after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can katrina help mend transatlantic ties ?
one small positive aspect of all the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina might be an improvement in transatlantic ties strained by the war in iraq , experts say .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .
a further 23 billion euros in privatizations have been earmarked for 2006 .
the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .
" the new government wo n't be able to afford any further shortfalls in tax revenues , " said johannes eeckhoff , economics professor at cologne university .

but , as expected , sommer stopped short of endorsing the spd for the election .
schröder said he and sommer were united in their opposition to merkel 's proposal to cut tax exemptions on bonuses for working nights and weekends and benefits for commuters . workers know what 's good for them " workers know where they are hard-pressed and who is doing what , " sommer said of the competing election platforms .
german unions have been infuriated by schröder 's failure to bring down the jobless rate , now hovering above 11 percent , and by cuts to the social welfare state and unemployment benefits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader , franz muentefering but spd leaders have stepped up leftist rhetoric during the election campaign , and back in may , party chairman franz muentefering referred to international investors as a " swarm of locusts " besetting the country . merkel and the unions merkel met with sommer and other union leaders on tuesday but crossed swords over social policy .
she said that while the unions and the christian democrats were " broadly in agreement " over the need to create places on training schemes , they could not find common ground on the issue of flexibility in salary agreements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions are not without power the head of the new ver.di multi-industry service workers ' union , frank bsirske , said the two sides were still " very far apart " .
sommer , appearing to acknowledge the likely election outcome , said the unions were prepared to discuss issues with the conservatives but had clearly indicated to merkel where their " pain threshold " lay . merkel has vowed to water down the unions ' power to set industry-wide wages as part of her plans to speed up labor market reforms . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate has taken on heightened significance in germany , which is in the throes of an election campaign as the country goes to the polls on sept .

angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar germany 's federal commissioner of data protection , peter schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- , has argued that visible police presence would be more effective than more cameras .
we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " schaar told dw-world .
" even if an area is watched by video -lrb- that -rrb- does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .

" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .

boeing-707 jets from a small fleet of nato aircraft will deliver smaller aid items . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief says decision easy " this decision was an easy one , because no other answer could have been possible , " nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting .
" it shows that the nato alliance is ... ready to do its part in the diminishing of the human suffering - which is so huge . " nato officials said aircraft could be sent in a few days but the ships providing the bulk of the supplies will take longer take a minimum of two weeks . more than 90 countries helping u.s. ambassador to nato victoria nuland expressed gratitude for allies ' support " to help ensure that the enormous outpouring of humanitarian offers ... can get to those in need quickly . " in all , more than 90 countries have offered services or equipment and aid to us authorities , who are seeking to manage the influx of foreign help amid the devastation wreaked by the hurricane on the gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union , which groups many of the same countries as nato , has also stepped up to the plate to help us authorities deal with the consequences of hurricane katrina .
the united states on sunday officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other supplies for the victims of hurricane katrina , said the european commission . logistical problems preventing aid some european officials have cited logistical problems in getting aid to its destinations .
for example , one swedish plane full of supplies was kept waiting this week because it lacked approval to land in the united states . us president george w. bush , who has been heavily criticized for his handling of the catastrophe , initially refused foreign aid but reversed that stance faced with the scale of the disaster . earlier this week the us state department said that washington had already been offered one billion dollars ' worth of assistance from some 45 countries .
the last time the united states called for nato help was in 2002 when alliance surveillance planes were used to monitor the skies over the salt lake city olympic games . before that , in the first time in its history , nato dispatched the awacs planes to help guard us airspace after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can katrina help mend transatlantic ties ?

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .
a further 23 billion euros in privatizations have been earmarked for 2006 .
the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .
" the new government wo n't be able to afford any further shortfalls in tax revenues , " said johannes eeckhoff , economics professor at cologne university .

but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .
a further 23 billion euros in privatizations have been earmarked for 2006 .
the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .
" the new government wo n't be able to afford any further shortfalls in tax revenues , " said johannes eeckhoff , economics professor at cologne university .

a third of 40-year-old women do not have children , causing politicians campaigning in germany 's election to push for a teutonic baby boom . chancellor gerhard schröder has made boosting a birthrate that is among the lowest in europe one of the key pledges of an election campaign focused on reviving germany 's moribund economy . his conservative challenger angela merkel , who looks set to become germany 's first woman chancellor , has promised a " better future for families " and financial help for parents until their children are 12 years old . if their policies differ in the detail , the right and the left both hope to breathe new life into an ageing society and avoid a future of too many pensioners and too few young earners . well-meaning but ineffective in 2004 , the average german woman had only 1.3 children , and projections show that by 2050 , a third of the population will be over the age of 60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning on a platform of children analysts say that if the incentives promised by the politicians are well-meaning , it is unlikely that they could rapidly reverse a demographic trend that has been decades in the making . they forecast that in the future almost half of those with a university education will never have children , in a country where the average life expectancy is around 76 for men and 82 for women . president horst koehler sounded the alarm in july when he gave the go-ahead for elections 12 months ahead of schedule , warning : " we have too few children and we are getting older and older . " family policy to make no difference yet the focus on family in the campaign seems to have almost no influence on how germans will vote on september 18 , according to klaus-peter schoeppner , the head of the emnid polling institute . " family policy is not expected to make any difference to the election results .
the vote is dominated by concerns about the labour market , more so still than the last one in 2002 , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has no children herself .
merkel 's christian democrats wish to preserve " the traditional family model " while schröder 's social democrats want to make life easier for working mothers and plan to create 230,000 new places in pre-schools by 2010 . the current government 's family minister , renate schmidt , has proposed new payments for parents who take time off work to care for a baby of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,230 -rrb- per month , until the child 's first birthday . the plan has been described as " impossible to finance " by ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven who is considered as childless merkel 's likely choice of family minister should she win the election . instead the conservatives are promising tax breaks for parents as well as a reduction of their monthly contributions towards the state pension funds . " financial incentives are not enough , " said josef schmid , a lecturer at the university of bamberg in southern germany .
" we need more pre-schools like there are in france , greater measures to make it easier for women to combine children with a career and more stable couples . " appreciation of children missing in a study by the federal demographics institute , 83 percent of those questioned said their main reason for not having children was the lack of a stable relationship .
some 60 percent also said they were too worried about what the future held to bring children into the world . the german press has remarked that perhaps what is missing is a general appreciation of children , not constant reminders that every newborn will eventually be a consumer and taxpayer . after all , the newspapers have said , the natural and somewhat obscure longing to have a child has little to do with state subsidies and labor market structures . " nobody wants to say out loud what is really happening , " retired demographics professor herwig birg said . he said the incentives to make more german babies have come " too late " and the ageing nature of the population has become " impossible to reverse " . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the birth-rate problem sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate has taken on heightened significance in germany , which is in the throes of an election campaign as the country goes to the polls on sept .
18 .
angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar germany 's federal commissioner of data protection , peter schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- , has argued that visible police presence would be more effective than more cameras .
we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " schaar told dw-world .
" even if an area is watched by video -lrb- that -rrb- does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes . "
others have voiced concerns over the financial costs and the sensitive issue of data protection .
" despite the success of their manhunts , the british have now sobered up because the financial cost of blanket video surveillance is enormous , " christian pfeiffer of the criminology institute of the state of lower saxony told spiegel online .
" who is going to guarantee that extracts of video surveillance footage wo n't be shown on private television , as is the case in england ? "
pfeiffer said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mulling more video surveillance in germany video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .
a further 23 billion euros in privatizations have been earmarked for 2006 .
the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .
" the new government wo n't be able to afford any further shortfalls in tax revenues , " said johannes eeckhoff , economics professor at cologne university .

in africa , the last day of world cup qualifiers will be both joyful and agonizing .
so far , only one of five teams can safely book its hotel rooms in germany . the past week has shown just how quickly a coach 's fate can be turned upside down .
german coach jürgen klinsmann sowed abuse after his team 's dismal performance in bratislava last saturday .
but with the reinstatement of young striker lukas podolski into the starting lineup against south africa on wednesday and the ensuing 4-2 victory , the calls for his head quieted .
fortunately for klinsmann , germany automatically qualifies for next year 's world cup as host .
not so for england .
coach sven-goran eriksson was well on his way to leading his side to direct qualification for the tournament just ten days ago .
but a less than stellar performance against wales that ended in a narrow 1-0 win against neighbor wales was topped by a stunning 1-0 defeat at the hands of northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's coach sven goran eriksson is in the crossfire of criticism a team england had not lost to since 1927 .
the reactions in the english press were quick and merciless .
" worst defeat in over 50 years " screamed the daily mirror .
the tabloid the sun was more direct - fire eriksson .
and english fans who accompanied the team to belfast sang " sack the swede . "
tactical mistakes not only the loss to minnows northern ireland left a bitter aftertaste , but also how it happened .
the tactics of eriksson have come under increasing criticism within the english football association .
" there 's no form , no pattern to the team 's play , " one senior fa man told the daily telegraph .
" where 's the pride ?
sven 's got to sort the bloody thing out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all is well with wayne rooney who is suspended for next qualifier leaving striker michael owen alone to fend for himself with five supporting midfielders , including true forward wayne rooney , has left many a soccer fans and critics scratching their heads .
eriksson has refused to hang up his whistle pointing out that should england win their next two qualifiers in october , then england is qualified .
but that is easier said than done as england must beat austria , third place in the group , and poland , group six leaders .
four african slots up for grabs this weekend , the final four of the five african teams will be determined .
ghana is the only nation practically assured of qualifying for germany 2006 after getting help from burkina faso who beat south africa .
only an improbable chain of events would force them to alter their plans for next june .
in group one , togo and senegal lie at the top on 20 and 18 points respectively .
it wo n't be until sunday that the group winner is clear .
senegal can seize the lead they beat zambia on friday .
togo must travel to brazzaville to play congo on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon -lrb- in green -rrb- against germany last november cameroon 's indomitable lions made a spectacular comeback in abidjan to beat nearest competitors ivory coast 3-2 last weekend .
the lions can assure themselves a spot on sunday by winning against egypt .
should the ivory coast lose to sudan on friday however , then achille webo , who scored a hat-trick against ivory coast will become an instant national hero .
old standbys nigeria hope to appear in their fourth world cup in a row but need some help .
they are even on points with angola , but because the angolans have a better head-to-head record , the eagles will have be clear on points to qualify .
this may be wishful thinking because angola face last-place rwanda on sunday .

in africa , the last day of world cup qualifiers will be both joyful and agonizing .
so far , only one of five teams can safely book its hotel rooms in germany . the past week has shown just how quickly a coach 's fate can be turned upside down .
german coach jürgen klinsmann sowed abuse after his team 's dismal performance in bratislava last saturday .
but with the reinstatement of young striker lukas podolski into the starting lineup against south africa on wednesday and the ensuing 4-2 victory , the calls for his head quieted .
fortunately for klinsmann , germany automatically qualifies for next year 's world cup as host .
not so for england .
coach sven-goran eriksson was well on his way to leading his side to direct qualification for the tournament just ten days ago .
but a less than stellar performance against wales that ended in a narrow 1-0 win against neighbor wales was topped by a stunning 1-0 defeat at the hands of northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's coach sven goran eriksson is in the crossfire of criticism a team england had not lost to since 1927 .
the reactions in the english press were quick and merciless .
" worst defeat in over 50 years " screamed the daily mirror .
the tabloid the sun was more direct - fire eriksson .
and english fans who accompanied the team to belfast sang " sack the swede . "
tactical mistakes not only the loss to minnows northern ireland left a bitter aftertaste , but also how it happened .
the tactics of eriksson have come under increasing criticism within the english football association .
" there 's no form , no pattern to the team 's play , " one senior fa man told the daily telegraph .
" where 's the pride ?
sven 's got to sort the bloody thing out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all is well with wayne rooney who is suspended for next qualifier leaving striker michael owen alone to fend for himself with five supporting midfielders , including true forward wayne rooney , has left many a soccer fans and critics scratching their heads .
eriksson has refused to hang up his whistle pointing out that should england win their next two qualifiers in october , then england is qualified .
but that is easier said than done as england must beat austria , third place in the group , and poland , group six leaders .
four african slots up for grabs this weekend , the final four of the five african teams will be determined .
ghana is the only nation practically assured of qualifying for germany 2006 after getting help from burkina faso who beat south africa .
only an improbable chain of events would force them to alter their plans for next june .
in group one , togo and senegal lie at the top on 20 and 18 points respectively .
it wo n't be until sunday that the group winner is clear .
senegal can seize the lead they beat zambia on friday .
togo must travel to brazzaville to play congo on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon -lrb- in green -rrb- against germany last november cameroon 's indomitable lions made a spectacular comeback in abidjan to beat nearest competitors ivory coast 3-2 last weekend .
the lions can assure themselves a spot on sunday by winning against egypt .
should the ivory coast lose to sudan on friday however , then achille webo , who scored a hat-trick against ivory coast will become an instant national hero .
old standbys nigeria hope to appear in their fourth world cup in a row but need some help .
they are even on points with angola , but because the angolans have a better head-to-head record , the eagles will have be clear on points to qualify .
this may be wishful thinking because angola face last-place rwanda on sunday .
finally , confederations cup participant tunisia and group five leader hook up with second-place morocco on saturday in tunis .

a third of 40-year-old women do not have children , causing politicians campaigning in germany 's election to push for a teutonic baby boom . chancellor gerhard schröder has made boosting a birthrate that is among the lowest in europe one of the key pledges of an election campaign focused on reviving germany 's moribund economy . his conservative challenger angela merkel , who looks set to become germany 's first woman chancellor , has promised a " better future for families " and financial help for parents until their children are 12 years old . if their policies differ in the detail , the right and the left both hope to breathe new life into an ageing society and avoid a future of too many pensioners and too few young earners . well-meaning but ineffective in 2004 , the average german woman had only 1.3 children , and projections show that by 2050 , a third of the population will be over the age of 60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning on a platform of children analysts say that if the incentives promised by the politicians are well-meaning , it is unlikely that they could rapidly reverse a demographic trend that has been decades in the making . they forecast that in the future almost half of those with a university education will never have children , in a country where the average life expectancy is around 76 for men and 82 for women . president horst koehler sounded the alarm in july when he gave the go-ahead for elections 12 months ahead of schedule , warning : " we have too few children and we are getting older and older . " family policy to make no difference yet the focus on family in the campaign seems to have almost no influence on how germans will vote on september 18 , according to klaus-peter schoeppner , the head of the emnid polling institute . " family policy is not expected to make any difference to the election results .
the vote is dominated by concerns about the labour market , more so still than the last one in 2002 , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has no children herself .
merkel 's christian democrats wish to preserve " the traditional family model " while schröder 's social democrats want to make life easier for working mothers and plan to create 230,000 new places in pre-schools by 2010 . the current government 's family minister , renate schmidt , has proposed new payments for parents who take time off work to care for a baby of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,230 -rrb- per month , until the child 's first birthday . the plan has been described as " impossible to finance " by ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven who is considered as childless merkel 's likely choice of family minister should she win the election . instead the conservatives are promising tax breaks for parents as well as a reduction of their monthly contributions towards the state pension funds . " financial incentives are not enough , " said josef schmid , a lecturer at the university of bamberg in southern germany .
" we need more pre-schools like there are in france , greater measures to make it easier for women to combine children with a career and more stable couples . " appreciation of children missing in a study by the federal demographics institute , 83 percent of those questioned said their main reason for not having children was the lack of a stable relationship .
some 60 percent also said they were too worried about what the future held to bring children into the world . the german press has remarked that perhaps what is missing is a general appreciation of children , not constant reminders that every newborn will eventually be a consumer and taxpayer . after all , the newspapers have said , the natural and somewhat obscure longing to have a child has little to do with state subsidies and labor market structures . " nobody wants to say out loud what is really happening , " retired demographics professor herwig birg said . he said the incentives to make more german babies have come " too late " and the ageing nature of the population has become " impossible to reverse " . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the birth-rate problem sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems .

" waiting for the barbarians " premieres on saturday in the eastern german town of erfurt . erfurt , a small city in the eastern german state of thuringia , will put itself on the world opera map this week with the premiere of a new work by american minimalist composer philip glass . " waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .
a further 23 billion euros in privatizations have been earmarked for 2006 .
the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .
" the new government wo n't be able to afford any further shortfalls in tax revenues , " said johannes eeckhoff , economics professor at cologne university .

" waiting for the barbarians " premieres on saturday in the eastern german town of erfurt . erfurt , a small city in the eastern german state of thuringia , will put itself on the world opera map this week with the premiere of a new work by american minimalist composer philip glass . " waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .
six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas . " glass 's music is very harmonic and very listenable , " montavon said . bildunterschrift : the sets for " waiting for the barbarians " are by george tsypin allegory of the iraq war the composer sees the work as a criticism of the iraq war led by us president george w. bush - something that made it all the more surprising for glass when the opera was invited to hold its us premiere in austin , texas in january 2007 . " we were very surprised by the invitation " , he told germany 's dpa news agency . " but austin is n't texas , " he said , adding that bush 's policies were not as hotly disputed now as during the height of the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt theater opened in 2003 glass praised the erfurt theater for staging the work and for its commitment to contemporary music theater in general . he also lauded the theater 's musical standards , noting that the chorus and orchestra were able to recreate his sound world without any difficulty . " this sort of openness is not always found in other opera houses , " he said . ambitious project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern erfurt theater cost 60 million euros to complete erfurt managed to entice us maestro dennis russell davies - who has conducted many glass premieres - for the production . " he is the best midwife for my pieces , " the composer said . the sets are by russian theater designer , george tsypin , and the costumes are by german designer hank irwin kittel . glass said he likes to maintain links with opera houses that have performed his works and he could imagine returning to erfurt in the future . opened in september 2003 , the erfurt theater took four years to build .
it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.09.2005 big brother on hamburg 's reeperbahn ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is raising its head amid the neon sleaze of the reeperbahn hamburg wants to install surveillance cameras on the city 's red-light drag , the reeperbahn , to fight violent crime .
the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate has taken on heightened significance in germany , which is in the throes of an election campaign as the country goes to the polls on sept .
18 .
angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .

angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate has taken on heightened significance in germany , which is in the throes of an election campaign as the country goes to the polls on sept .
18 .
angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar germany 's federal commissioner of data protection , peter schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- , has argued that visible police presence would be more effective than more cameras .
we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " schaar told dw-world .
" even if an area is watched by video -lrb- that -rrb- does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .

" i ca n't imagine that a decision would be made in four weeks , " she told reporters as she arrived at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in newcastle , northern england . the member states committed themselves to reaching an agreement on the issue by october , following the bombings in london on july 7 , in which 52 commuters were killed during the morning rush hour . weighing security against the costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries believes more time is needed for an eu-wide agreement zypries said that several questions about the controversial measures remained unanswered , such as who will foot the potentially massive bill for keeping records on calls and e-mail for up to a year .

andreas renner , the state minister for social affairs in baden-wuerttemberg state , told reporters on wednesday : " he deserves to be shot , " according to a local newspaper published thursday .
it sparked outrage in germany , where several politicians campaigning for national elections on september 18 have criticized washington 's response to the catastrophe , but none have gone so far .
the state chapter of social democrats called for renner 's resignation while his own christian democrats , who are expected to win the election , also criticized his remarks .
renner said thursday that he had meant bush should be " shot down in the political sense .
i withdraw what i said with regret . "
it is not the first time that a politician has landed in hot water over a remark against bush in the throes of a national election campaign .
in 2002 , the social democrats ' federal justice minister herta daeubler-gmelin was forced to quit after she compared the us pesident to nazi leader adolf hitler .

" i ca n't imagine that a decision would be made in four weeks , " she told reporters as she arrived at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in newcastle , northern england . the member states committed themselves to reaching an agreement on the issue by october , following the bombings in london on july 7 , in which 52 commuters were killed during the morning rush hour . weighing security against the costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries believes more time is needed for an eu-wide agreement zypries said that several questions about the controversial measures remained unanswered , such as who will foot the potentially massive bill for keeping records on calls and e-mail for up to a year . " for german companies , it would cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 124 million -rrb- .
either the state will pay for it or the consumers .
in the end , you have to weigh security against the costs , " she said . the deal , according to a project presented last year by britain , france , ireland and sweden , would affect a wide range of equipment including land line and mobile telephones , text messages , e-mails and internet protocols . extending legal boundaries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberty advocates are worried about privacy intrusions the main thrust of it is that telecom operators would keep , generally for a year , information concerning the sender , receiver , time , place and length of any communication but not a record of the conversation or message itself .
internet data would be retained for six months . the ministers also want records of calls that went unanswered to be included .
those details were vital for spanish police investigating the madrid bombings in march 2004 . the plan allows , however , a certain degree of flexibility in applying the rules . " we could not go beyond six months because we are bound by the decision of our parliament " on retaining data , said zypries .

" i ca n't imagine that a decision would be made in four weeks , " she told reporters as she arrived at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in newcastle , northern england . the member states committed themselves to reaching an agreement on the issue by october , following the bombings in london on july 7 , in which 52 commuters were killed during the morning rush hour . weighing security against the costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries believes more time is needed for an eu-wide agreement zypries said that several questions about the controversial measures remained unanswered , such as who will foot the potentially massive bill for keeping records on calls and e-mail for up to a year . " for german companies , it would cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 124 million -rrb- .
either the state will pay for it or the consumers .
in the end , you have to weigh security against the costs , " she said . the deal , according to a project presented last year by britain , france , ireland and sweden , would affect a wide range of equipment including land line and mobile telephones , text messages , e-mails and internet protocols . extending legal boundaries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberty advocates are worried about privacy intrusions the main thrust of it is that telecom operators would keep , generally for a year , information concerning the sender , receiver , time , place and length of any communication but not a record of the conversation or message itself .
internet data would be retained for six months . the ministers also want records of calls that went unanswered to be included .
those details were vital for spanish police investigating the madrid bombings in march 2004 . the plan allows , however , a certain degree of flexibility in applying the rules . " we could not go beyond six months because we are bound by the decision of our parliament " on retaining data , said zypries .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .
for many , it 's a long-overdue move .
" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .

starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .

" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .
a further 23 billion euros in privatizations have been earmarked for 2006 .
the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .
" the new government wo n't be able to afford any further shortfalls in tax revenues , " said johannes eeckhoff , economics professor at cologne university .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .
" the hurricane comes at a moment where our relations are back on track and excellent as they should be . " a reallocation of priorities simon serfaty , an expert on european affairs at the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- in washington said though he did not feel the hurricane and its aftermath could have a direct impact on transatlantic ties , it could have a ripple effect . he said the unfolding domestic debate between democrats and republicans on the handling of the disaster may force president george w. bush to reassess his priorities and change his agenda , thus affecting his foreign policy . " how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .
" the reallocation of priorities is very important , because this would in fact be done possibly at the expense of some of the us role in the world .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .
for many , it 's a long-overdue move .
" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .
müller pointed to scandinavia as an example where letter monopolies have been absent for some years , saying increased competition would not pose problems for either deutsche post or germany at large . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post faces red-letter days on monday deutsche post was ordered to cease actions that limited competition in the pre-sorting business .
on friday , a law may be passed that could end its letter monopoly .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .
" the hurricane comes at a moment where our relations are back on track and excellent as they should be . " a reallocation of priorities simon serfaty , an expert on european affairs at the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- in washington said though he did not feel the hurricane and its aftermath could have a direct impact on transatlantic ties , it could have a ripple effect . he said the unfolding domestic debate between democrats and republicans on the handling of the disaster may force president george w. bush to reassess his priorities and change his agenda , thus affecting his foreign policy . " how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .
" the reallocation of priorities is very important , because this would in fact be done possibly at the expense of some of the us role in the world .

" it would appear to be more of a political problem than an economic one , a show of force on the part of president putin and russia , " polish prime minister marek belka said .
" according to experts , building a gas pipeline under the baltic sea will be much costlier than building one across poland . "
polish president said told public radio that schröder " tried to hide the obvious : he included the signature of this accord in his campaign ahead of the legislative elections of september 18 . "
he called on opposition candidate angela merkel to halt the project .
russian energy giant gazprom and german firms eon and basf signed a deal on thursday to build a five-billion-dollar pipeline linking russia and germany , at a ceremony attended by putin and schröder .
the north european gas pipeline will allow the world 's largest gas reserves to be piped directly to the western european market .

the pipeline , which will run under the baltic sea from vyborg near st petersburg to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany , is scheduled to go into operation in 2010 . dw-world.de critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .
" the hurricane comes at a moment where our relations are back on track and excellent as they should be . " a reallocation of priorities simon serfaty , an expert on european affairs at the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- in washington said though he did not feel the hurricane and its aftermath could have a direct impact on transatlantic ties , it could have a ripple effect . he said the unfolding domestic debate between democrats and republicans on the handling of the disaster may force president george w. bush to reassess his priorities and change his agenda , thus affecting his foreign policy . " how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .
" the reallocation of priorities is very important , because this would in fact be done possibly at the expense of some of the us role in the world .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .

" it would appear to be more of a political problem than an economic one , a show of force on the part of president putin and russia , " polish prime minister marek belka said .
" according to experts , building a gas pipeline under the baltic sea will be much costlier than building one across poland . "
polish president said told public radio that schröder " tried to hide the obvious : he included the signature of this accord in his campaign ahead of the legislative elections of september 18 . "
he called on opposition candidate angela merkel to halt the project .
russian energy giant gazprom and german firms eon and basf signed a deal on thursday to build a five-billion-dollar pipeline linking russia and germany , at a ceremony attended by putin and schröder .
the north european gas pipeline will allow the world 's largest gas reserves to be piped directly to the western european market .
but its route dimension to the project . "
the pipeline , which will run under the baltic sea from vyborg near st petersburg to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany , is scheduled to go into operation in 2010 . dw-world.de critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .
critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .
" there 's a lot of movement , everything is possible , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's economic woes and the election whoever wins the general election on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.09.2005 can katrina help mend transatlantic ties ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to help america in its time of need one small positive aspect of all the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina might be an improvement in transatlantic ties strained by the war in iraq , experts say . france is sending relief teams and planes laden with supplies .
german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .
" the hurricane comes at a moment where our relations are back on track and excellent as they should be . " a reallocation of priorities simon serfaty , an expert on european affairs at the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- in washington said though he did not feel the hurricane and its aftermath could have a direct impact on transatlantic ties , it could have a ripple effect . he said the unfolding domestic debate between democrats and republicans on the handling of the disaster may force president george w. bush to reassess his priorities and change his agenda , thus affecting his foreign policy . " how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .
" the reallocation of priorities is very important , because this would in fact be done possibly at the expense of some of the us role in the world .

but , as expected , sommer stopped short of endorsing the spd for the election .
schröder said he and sommer were united in their opposition to merkel 's proposal to cut tax exemptions on bonuses for working nights and weekends and benefits for commuters . workers know what 's good for them " workers know where they are hard-pressed and who is doing what , " sommer said of the competing election platforms .

she said that while the unions and the christian democrats were " broadly in agreement " over the need to create places on training schemes , they could not find common ground on the issue of flexibility in salary agreements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions are not without power the head of the new ver.di multi-industry service workers ' union , frank bsirske , said the two sides were still " very far apart " .
sommer , appearing to acknowledge the likely election outcome , said the unions were prepared to discuss issues with the conservatives but had clearly indicated to merkel where their " pain threshold " lay . merkel has vowed to water down the unions ' power to set industry-wide wages as part of her plans to speed up labor market reforms . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

some 60 percent also said they were too worried about what the future held to bring children into the world . the german press has remarked that perhaps what is missing is a general appreciation of children , not constant reminders that every newborn will eventually be a consumer and taxpayer . after all , the newspapers have said , the natural and somewhat obscure longing to have a child has little to do with state subsidies and labor market structures . " nobody wants to say out loud what is really happening , " retired demographics professor herwig birg said . he said the incentives to make more german babies have come " too late " and the ageing nature of the population has become " impossible to reverse " . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the birth-rate problem sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.09.2005 germany 's economic woes and the election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waits are still long at the unemployment office whoever wins the general election on sept .
18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .
a further 23 billion euros in privatizations have been earmarked for 2006 .
the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .
" the new government wo n't be able to afford any further shortfalls in tax revenues , " said johannes eeckhoff , economics professor at cologne university .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .

in africa , the last day of world cup qualifiers will be both joyful and agonizing .
so far , only one of five teams can safely book its hotel rooms in germany . the past week has shown just how quickly a coach 's fate can be turned upside down .
german coach jürgen klinsmann sowed abuse after his team 's dismal performance in bratislava last saturday .
but with the reinstatement of young striker lukas podolski into the starting lineup against south africa on wednesday and the ensuing 4-2 victory , the calls for his head quieted .
fortunately for klinsmann , germany automatically qualifies for next year 's world cup as host .
not so for england .
coach sven-goran eriksson was well on his way to leading his side to direct qualification for the tournament just ten days ago .
but a less than stellar performance against wales that ended in a narrow 1-0 win against neighbor wales was topped by a stunning 1-0 defeat at the hands of northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's coach sven goran eriksson is in the crossfire of criticism a team england had not lost to since 1927 .
the reactions in the english press were quick and merciless .
" worst defeat in over 50 years " screamed the daily mirror .
the tabloid the sun was more direct - fire eriksson .
and english fans who accompanied the team to belfast sang " sack the swede . "
tactical mistakes not only the loss to minnows northern ireland left a bitter aftertaste , but also how it happened .
the tactics of eriksson have come under increasing criticism within the english football association .
" there 's no form , no pattern to the team 's play , " one senior fa man told the daily telegraph .
" where 's the pride ?
sven 's got to sort the bloody thing out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all is well with wayne rooney who is suspended for next qualifier leaving striker michael owen alone to fend for himself with five supporting midfielders , including true forward wayne rooney , has left many a soccer fans and critics scratching their heads .
eriksson has refused to hang up his whistle pointing out that should england win their next two qualifiers in october , then england is qualified .
but that is easier said than done as england must beat austria , third place in the group , and poland , group six leaders .
four african slots up for grabs this weekend , the final four of the five african teams will be determined .
ghana is the only nation practically assured of qualifying for germany 2006 after getting help from burkina faso who beat south africa .
only an improbable chain of events would force them to alter their plans for next june .
in group one , togo and senegal lie at the top on 20 and 18 points respectively .
it wo n't be until sunday that the group winner is clear .
senegal can seize the lead they beat zambia on friday .
togo must travel to brazzaville to play congo on sunday .

in africa , the last day of world cup qualifiers will be both joyful and agonizing .
so far , only one of five teams can safely book its hotel rooms in germany . the past week has shown just how quickly a coach 's fate can be turned upside down .
german coach jürgen klinsmann sowed abuse after his team 's dismal performance in bratislava last saturday .
but with the reinstatement of young striker lukas podolski into the starting lineup against south africa on wednesday and the ensuing 4-2 victory , the calls for his head quieted .
fortunately for klinsmann , germany automatically qualifies for next year 's world cup as host .
not so for england .
coach sven-goran eriksson was well on his way to leading his side to direct qualification for the tournament just ten days ago .
but a less than stellar performance against wales that ended in a narrow 1-0 win against neighbor wales was topped by a stunning 1-0 defeat at the hands of northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's coach sven goran eriksson is in the crossfire of criticism a team england had not lost to since 1927 .
the reactions in the english press were quick and merciless .
" worst defeat in over 50 years " screamed the daily mirror .
the tabloid the sun was more direct - fire eriksson .
and english fans who accompanied the team to belfast sang " sack the swede . "
tactical mistakes not only the loss to minnows northern ireland left a bitter aftertaste , but also how it happened .
the tactics of eriksson have come under increasing criticism within the english football association .
" there 's no form , no pattern to the team 's play , " one senior fa man told the daily telegraph .
" where 's the pride ?
sven 's got to sort the bloody thing out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all is well with wayne rooney who is suspended for next qualifier leaving striker michael owen alone to fend for himself with five supporting midfielders , including true forward wayne rooney , has left many a soccer fans and critics scratching their heads .
eriksson has refused to hang up his whistle pointing out that should england win their next two qualifiers in october , then england is qualified .
but that is easier said than done as england must beat austria , third place in the group , and poland , group six leaders .
four african slots up for grabs this weekend , the final four of the five african teams will be determined .
ghana is the only nation practically assured of qualifying for germany 2006 after getting help from burkina faso who beat south africa .
only an improbable chain of events would force them to alter their plans for next june .
in group one , togo and senegal lie at the top on 20 and 18 points respectively .
it wo n't be until sunday that the group winner is clear .
senegal can seize the lead they beat zambia on friday .
togo must travel to brazzaville to play congo on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon -lrb- in green -rrb- against germany last november cameroon 's indomitable lions made a spectacular comeback in abidjan to beat nearest competitors ivory coast 3-2 last weekend .
the lions can assure themselves a spot on sunday by winning against egypt .
should the ivory coast lose to sudan on friday however , then achille webo , who scored a hat-trick against ivory coast will become an instant national hero .
old standbys nigeria hope to appear in their fourth world cup in a row but need some help .
they are even on points with angola , but because the angolans have a better head-to-head record , the eagles will have be clear on points to qualify .
this may be wishful thinking because angola face last-place rwanda on sunday .
finally , confederations cup participant tunisia and group five leader hook up with second-place morocco on saturday in tunis .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate has taken on heightened significance in germany , which is in the throes of an election campaign as the country goes to the polls on sept .
18 .
angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar germany 's federal commissioner of data protection , peter schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- , has argued that visible police presence would be more effective than more cameras .
we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " schaar told dw-world .
" even if an area is watched by video -lrb- that -rrb- does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes . "
others have voiced concerns over the financial costs and the sensitive issue of data protection .
" despite the success of their manhunts , the british have now sobered up because the financial cost of blanket video surveillance is enormous , " christian pfeiffer of the criminology institute of the state of lower saxony told spiegel online .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate has taken on heightened significance in germany , which is in the throes of an election campaign as the country goes to the polls on sept .
18 .
angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar germany 's federal commissioner of data protection , peter schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- , has argued that visible police presence would be more effective than more cameras .
we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " schaar told dw-world .
" even if an area is watched by video -lrb- that -rrb- does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes . "
others have voiced concerns over the financial costs and the sensitive issue of data protection .
" despite the success of their manhunts , the british have now sobered up because the financial cost of blanket video surveillance is enormous , " christian pfeiffer of the criminology institute of the state of lower saxony told spiegel online .
" who is going to guarantee that extracts of video surveillance footage wo n't be shown on private television , as is the case in england ? "

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .
" the hurricane comes at a moment where our relations are back on track and excellent as they should be . " a reallocation of priorities simon serfaty , an expert on european affairs at the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- in washington said though he did not feel the hurricane and its aftermath could have a direct impact on transatlantic ties , it could have a ripple effect . he said the unfolding domestic debate between democrats and republicans on the handling of the disaster may force president george w. bush to reassess his priorities and change his agenda , thus affecting his foreign policy . " how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .
" the reallocation of priorities is very important , because this would in fact be done possibly at the expense of some of the us role in the world .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .

" a reallocation of priorities simon serfaty , an expert on european affairs at the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- in washington said though he did not feel the hurricane and its aftermath could have a direct impact on transatlantic ties , it could have a ripple effect . he said the unfolding domestic debate between democrats and republicans on the handling of the disaster may force president george w. bush to reassess his priorities and change his agenda , thus affecting his foreign policy . " how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .

" waiting for the barbarians " premieres on saturday in the eastern german town of erfurt . erfurt , a small city in the eastern german state of thuringia , will put itself on the world opera map this week with the premiere of a new work by american minimalist composer philip glass . " waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .
six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas .

it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

" waiting for the barbarians " premieres on saturday in the eastern german town of erfurt . erfurt , a small city in the eastern german state of thuringia , will put itself on the world opera map this week with the premiere of a new work by american minimalist composer philip glass . " waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .
six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas . " glass 's music is very harmonic and very listenable , " montavon said . bildunterschrift : the sets for " waiting for the barbarians " are by george tsypin allegory of the iraq war the composer sees the work as a criticism of the iraq war led by us president george w. bush - something that made it all the more surprising for glass when the opera was invited to hold its us premiere in austin , texas in january 2007 . " we were very surprised by the invitation " , he told germany 's dpa news agency . " but austin is n't texas , " he said , adding that bush 's policies were not as hotly disputed now as during the height of the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt theater opened in 2003 glass praised the erfurt theater for staging the work and for its commitment to contemporary music theater in general . he also lauded the theater 's musical standards , noting that the chorus and orchestra were able to recreate his sound world without any difficulty . " this sort of openness is not always found in other opera houses , " he said . ambitious project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern erfurt theater cost 60 million euros to complete erfurt managed to entice us maestro dennis russell davies - who has conducted many glass premieres - for the production . " he is the best midwife for my pieces , " the composer said . the sets are by russian theater designer , george tsypin , and the costumes are by german designer hank irwin kittel . glass said he likes to maintain links with opera houses that have performed his works and he could imagine returning to erfurt in the future . opened in september 2003 , the erfurt theater took four years to build .
it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

boeing-707 jets from a small fleet of nato aircraft will deliver smaller aid items . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief says decision easy " this decision was an easy one , because no other answer could have been possible , " nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting .
" it shows that the nato alliance is ... ready to do its part in the diminishing of the human suffering - which is so huge . " nato officials said aircraft could be sent in a few days but the ships providing the bulk of the supplies will take longer take a minimum of two weeks . more than 90 countries helping u.s. ambassador to nato victoria nuland expressed gratitude for allies ' support " to help ensure that the enormous outpouring of humanitarian offers ... can get to those in need quickly . " in all , more than 90 countries have offered services or equipment and aid to us authorities , who are seeking to manage the influx of foreign help amid the devastation wreaked by the hurricane on the gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union , which groups many of the same countries as nato , has also stepped up to the plate to help us authorities deal with the consequences of hurricane katrina .
the united states on sunday officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other supplies for the victims of hurricane katrina , said the european commission . logistical problems preventing aid some european officials have cited logistical problems in getting aid to its destinations .
for example , one swedish plane full of supplies was kept waiting this week because it lacked approval to land in the united states . us president george w. bush , who has been heavily criticized for his handling of the catastrophe , initially refused foreign aid but reversed that stance faced with the scale of the disaster . earlier this week the us state department said that washington had already been offered one billion dollars ' worth of assistance from some 45 countries .
the last time the united states called for nato help was in 2002 when alliance surveillance planes were used to monitor the skies over the salt lake city olympic games . before that , in the first time in its history , nato dispatched the awacs planes to help guard us airspace after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can katrina help mend transatlantic ties ?

" i ca n't imagine that a decision would be made in four weeks , " she told reporters as she arrived at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in newcastle , northern england . the member states committed themselves to reaching an agreement on the issue by october , following the bombings in london on july 7 , in which 52 commuters were killed during the morning rush hour . weighing security against the costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries believes more time is needed for an eu-wide agreement zypries said that several questions about the controversial measures remained unanswered , such as who will foot the potentially massive bill for keeping records on calls and e-mail for up to a year . " for german companies , it would cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 124 million -rrb- .
either the state will pay for it or the consumers .
in the end , you have to weigh security against the costs , " she said . the deal , according to a project presented last year by britain , france , ireland and sweden , would affect a wide range of equipment including land line and mobile telephones , text messages , e-mails and internet protocols . extending legal boundaries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberty advocates are worried about privacy intrusions the main thrust of it is that telecom operators would keep , generally for a year , information concerning the sender , receiver , time , place and length of any communication but not a record of the conversation or message itself .
internet data would be retained for six months . the ministers also want records of calls that went unanswered to be included .
those details were vital for spanish police investigating the madrid bombings in march 2004 . the plan allows , however , a certain degree of flexibility in applying the rules . " we could not go beyond six months because we are bound by the decision of our parliament " on retaining data , said zypries .
german firms usually keep such information for three to six months for billing purposes . german interior minister otto schily said that he would be willing to try to push that period out to a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the high cost of security terrorism could pose a serious threat to world business , according to german trade group bga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.09.2005 germany 's economic woes and the election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waits are still long at the unemployment office whoever wins the general election on sept .
18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said .

the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .

bremen , hamburg and schalke are all chasing bayern , which is hoping to expand its early season lead . it 'll only be the fourth match day for germany 's top-flight soccer league this season , and already everybody is trying to catch fc bayern münchen .
but the defending champions are currently only two points clear of three teams that have serious title ambitions this year : werder bremen , hamburg sv , and schalke 04 .
all four clubs will be playing away this weekend , increasing the competition to come out on top .
bayern will travel to bavarian rivals 1 .
fc nürnberg , bremen heads to 1 .
fc kaiserslautern , hamburg will take on 1 .
fsv mainz 05 and schalke will go to bayern leverkusen .
bavarian derby all of those match-ups are manageable for the visitors and bayern in particular will have the motivation to show struggling nürnberg who 's boss .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .
for many , it 's a long-overdue move .
" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .
müller pointed to scandinavia as an example where letter monopolies have been absent for some years , saying increased competition would not pose problems for either deutsche post or germany at large . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post faces red-letter days on monday deutsche post was ordered to cease actions that limited competition in the pre-sorting business .
on friday , a law may be passed that could end its letter monopoly .
the company has had better weeks .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .
" the hurricane comes at a moment where our relations are back on track and excellent as they should be . " a reallocation of priorities simon serfaty , an expert on european affairs at the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- in washington said though he did not feel the hurricane and its aftermath could have a direct impact on transatlantic ties , it could have a ripple effect . he said the unfolding domestic debate between democrats and republicans on the handling of the disaster may force president george w. bush to reassess his priorities and change his agenda , thus affecting his foreign policy . " how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .
" the reallocation of priorities is very important , because this would in fact be done possibly at the expense of some of the us role in the world .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .
for many , it 's a long-overdue move .
" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .
müller pointed to scandinavia as an example where letter monopolies have been absent for some years , saying increased competition would not pose problems for either deutsche post or germany at large . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post faces red-letter days on monday deutsche post was ordered to cease actions that limited competition in the pre-sorting business .
on friday , a law may be passed that could end its letter monopoly .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .

six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas .

it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

" waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .
six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas . " glass 's music is very harmonic and very listenable , " montavon said . bildunterschrift : the sets for " waiting for the barbarians " are by george tsypin allegory of the iraq war the composer sees the work as a criticism of the iraq war led by us president george w. bush - something that made it all the more surprising for glass when the opera was invited to hold its us premiere in austin , texas in january 2007 . " we were very surprised by the invitation " , he told germany 's dpa news agency . " but austin is n't texas , " he said , adding that bush 's policies were not as hotly disputed now as during the height of the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt theater opened in 2003 glass praised the erfurt theater for staging the work and for its commitment to contemporary music theater in general . he also lauded the theater 's musical standards , noting that the chorus and orchestra were able to recreate his sound world without any difficulty . " this sort of openness is not always found in other opera houses , " he said . ambitious project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern erfurt theater cost 60 million euros to complete erfurt managed to entice us maestro dennis russell davies - who has conducted many glass premieres - for the production . " he is the best midwife for my pieces , " the composer said . the sets are by russian theater designer , george tsypin , and the costumes are by german designer hank irwin kittel . glass said he likes to maintain links with opera houses that have performed his works and he could imagine returning to erfurt in the future . opened in september 2003 , the erfurt theater took four years to build .
it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

a third of 40-year-old women do not have children , causing politicians campaigning in germany 's election to push for a teutonic baby boom . chancellor gerhard schröder has made boosting a birthrate that is among the lowest in europe one of the key pledges of an election campaign focused on reviving germany 's moribund economy . his conservative challenger angela merkel , who looks set to become germany 's first woman chancellor , has promised a " better future for families " and financial help for parents until their children are 12 years old . if their policies differ in the detail , the right and the left both hope to breathe new life into an ageing society and avoid a future of too many pensioners and too few young earners . well-meaning but ineffective in 2004 , the average german woman had only 1.3 children , and projections show that by 2050 , a third of the population will be over the age of 60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning on a platform of children analysts say that if the incentives promised by the politicians are well-meaning , it is unlikely that they could rapidly reverse a demographic trend that has been decades in the making . they forecast that in the future almost half of those with a university education will never have children , in a country where the average life expectancy is around 76 for men and 82 for women . president horst koehler sounded the alarm in july when he gave the go-ahead for elections 12 months ahead of schedule , warning : " we have too few children and we are getting older and older . " family policy to make no difference yet the focus on family in the campaign seems to have almost no influence on how germans will vote on september 18 , according to klaus-peter schoeppner , the head of the emnid polling institute .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .

angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar germany 's federal commissioner of data protection , peter schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- , has argued that visible police presence would be more effective than more cameras .
we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " schaar told dw-world .
" even if an area is watched by video -lrb- that -rrb- does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .

" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.09.2005 germany 's economic woes and the election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waits are still long at the unemployment office whoever wins the general election on sept .
18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .
a further 23 billion euros in privatizations have been earmarked for 2006 .
the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .
" the new government wo n't be able to afford any further shortfalls in tax revenues , " said johannes eeckhoff , economics professor at cologne university .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .
" there 's a lot of movement , everything is possible , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's economic woes and the election whoever wins the general election on sept .

boeing-707 jets from a small fleet of nato aircraft will deliver smaller aid items . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato chief says decision easy " this decision was an easy one , because no other answer could have been possible , " nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting .
" it shows that the nato alliance is ... ready to do its part in the diminishing of the human suffering - which is so huge . " nato officials said aircraft could be sent in a few days but the ships providing the bulk of the supplies will take longer take a minimum of two weeks . more than 90 countries helping u.s. ambassador to nato victoria nuland expressed gratitude for allies ' support " to help ensure that the enormous outpouring of humanitarian offers ... can get to those in need quickly . " in all , more than 90 countries have offered services or equipment and aid to us authorities , who are seeking to manage the influx of foreign help amid the devastation wreaked by the hurricane on the gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union , which groups many of the same countries as nato , has also stepped up to the plate to help us authorities deal with the consequences of hurricane katrina .
the united states on sunday officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other supplies for the victims of hurricane katrina , said the european commission . logistical problems preventing aid some european officials have cited logistical problems in getting aid to its destinations .
for example , one swedish plane full of supplies was kept waiting this week because it lacked approval to land in the united states . us president george w. bush , who has been heavily criticized for his handling of the catastrophe , initially refused foreign aid but reversed that stance faced with the scale of the disaster . earlier this week the us state department said that washington had already been offered one billion dollars ' worth of assistance from some 45 countries .
the last time the united states called for nato help was in 2002 when alliance surveillance planes were used to monitor the skies over the salt lake city olympic games . before that , in the first time in its history , nato dispatched the awacs planes to help guard us airspace after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can katrina help mend transatlantic ties ?

it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

" waiting for the barbarians " premieres on saturday in the eastern german town of erfurt . erfurt , a small city in the eastern german state of thuringia , will put itself on the world opera map this week with the premiere of a new work by american minimalist composer philip glass . " waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .
six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas . " glass 's music is very harmonic and very listenable , " montavon said . bildunterschrift : the sets for " waiting for the barbarians " are by george tsypin allegory of the iraq war the composer sees the work as a criticism of the iraq war led by us president george w. bush - something that made it all the more surprising for glass when the opera was invited to hold its us premiere in austin , texas in january 2007 . " we were very surprised by the invitation " , he told germany 's dpa news agency . " but austin is n't texas , " he said , adding that bush 's policies were not as hotly disputed now as during the height of the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt theater opened in 2003 glass praised the erfurt theater for staging the work and for its commitment to contemporary music theater in general . he also lauded the theater 's musical standards , noting that the chorus and orchestra were able to recreate his sound world without any difficulty . " this sort of openness is not always found in other opera houses , " he said . ambitious project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern erfurt theater cost 60 million euros to complete erfurt managed to entice us maestro dennis russell davies - who has conducted many glass premieres - for the production . " he is the best midwife for my pieces , " the composer said . the sets are by russian theater designer , george tsypin , and the costumes are by german designer hank irwin kittel . glass said he likes to maintain links with opera houses that have performed his works and he could imagine returning to erfurt in the future . opened in september 2003 , the erfurt theater took four years to build .
it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

a third of 40-year-old women do not have children , causing politicians campaigning in germany 's election to push for a teutonic baby boom . chancellor gerhard schröder has made boosting a birthrate that is among the lowest in europe one of the key pledges of an election campaign focused on reviving germany 's moribund economy . his conservative challenger angela merkel , who looks set to become germany 's first woman chancellor , has promised a " better future for families " and financial help for parents until their children are 12 years old . if their policies differ in the detail , the right and the left both hope to breathe new life into an ageing society and avoid a future of too many pensioners and too few young earners . well-meaning but ineffective in 2004 , the average german woman had only 1.3 children , and projections show that by 2050 , a third of the population will be over the age of 60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning on a platform of children analysts say that if the incentives promised by the politicians are well-meaning , it is unlikely that they could rapidly reverse a demographic trend that has been decades in the making . they forecast that in the future almost half of those with a university education will never have children , in a country where the average life expectancy is around 76 for men and 82 for women . president horst koehler sounded the alarm in july when he gave the go-ahead for elections 12 months ahead of schedule , warning : " we have too few children and we are getting older and older .

a third of 40-year-old women do not have children , causing politicians campaigning in germany 's election to push for a teutonic baby boom . chancellor gerhard schröder has made boosting a birthrate that is among the lowest in europe one of the key pledges of an election campaign focused on reviving germany 's moribund economy . his conservative challenger angela merkel , who looks set to become germany 's first woman chancellor , has promised a " better future for families " and financial help for parents until their children are 12 years old . if their policies differ in the detail , the right and the left both hope to breathe new life into an ageing society and avoid a future of too many pensioners and too few young earners . well-meaning but ineffective in 2004 , the average german woman had only 1.3 children , and projections show that by 2050 , a third of the population will be over the age of 60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning on a platform of children analysts say that if the incentives promised by the politicians are well-meaning , it is unlikely that they could rapidly reverse a demographic trend that has been decades in the making . they forecast that in the future almost half of those with a university education will never have children , in a country where the average life expectancy is around 76 for men and 82 for women . president horst koehler sounded the alarm in july when he gave the go-ahead for elections 12 months ahead of schedule , warning : " we have too few children and we are getting older and older .

the vote is dominated by concerns about the labour market , more so still than the last one in 2002 , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has no children herself .
merkel 's christian democrats wish to preserve " the traditional family model " while schröder 's social democrats want to make life easier for working mothers and plan to create 230,000 new places in pre-schools by 2010 . the current government 's family minister , renate schmidt , has proposed new payments for parents who take time off work to care for a baby of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,230 -rrb- per month , until the child 's first birthday . the plan has been described as " impossible to finance " by ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven who is considered as childless merkel 's likely choice of family minister should she win the election . instead the conservatives are promising tax breaks for parents as well as a reduction of their monthly contributions towards the state pension funds . " financial incentives are not enough , " said josef schmid , a lecturer at the university of bamberg in southern germany .
" we need more pre-schools like there are in france , greater measures to make it easier for women to combine children with a career and more stable couples . " appreciation of children missing in a study by the federal demographics institute , 83 percent of those questioned said their main reason for not having children was the lack of a stable relationship .
some 60 percent also said they were too worried about what the future held to bring children into the world . the german press has remarked that perhaps what is missing is a general appreciation of children , not constant reminders that every newborn will eventually be a consumer and taxpayer . after all , the newspapers have said , the natural and somewhat obscure longing to have a child has little to do with state subsidies and labor market structures . " nobody wants to say out loud what is really happening , " retired demographics professor herwig birg said . he said the incentives to make more german babies have come " too late " and the ageing nature of the population has become " impossible to reverse " . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the birth-rate problem sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems .

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate has taken on heightened significance in germany , which is in the throes of an election campaign as the country goes to the polls on sept .
18 .
angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar germany 's federal commissioner of data protection , peter schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- , has argued that visible police presence would be more effective than more cameras .
we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " schaar told dw-world .
" even if an area is watched by video -lrb- that -rrb- does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes . "
others have voiced concerns over the financial costs and the sensitive issue of data protection .
" despite the success of their manhunts , the british have now sobered up because the financial cost of blanket video surveillance is enormous , " christian pfeiffer of the criminology institute of the state of lower saxony told spiegel online .
" who is going to guarantee that extracts of video surveillance footage wo n't be shown on private television , as is the case in england ? "

the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures . better known for its strip joints , bordellos , casinos and smoky watering holes , hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn is also a hotbed of violent crime .
last year , incidents of bodily harm jumped by 19 percent in the port city 's st pauli district while drug-related crimes were up by 15 percent .
last weekend , a man wielding a knife ended up seriously wounding eight people in a bar in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising crime barometer in the city 's district of sleaze and grit - and at the same time its largest tourist attraction - has led hamburg 's interior senator , udo nagel , to take drastic steps .
this week , nagel presented a new security concept that involves setting up 12 sophisticated surveillance cameras on the reeperbahn alone .
starting next year , the city 's police will be able to clearly follow events on the strip in real time at a downtown office on a large screen .
" the reeperbahn is the biggest hub of criminality in hamburg , " nagel said on wednesday , adding that between may 2004 and april 2005 , police had counted 757 criminal offenses on the reeperbahn - more than in all of hamburg 's other neighborhoods .
" it 's about making the reeperbahn - as hamburg 's showpiece - safer , " he added .
nagel has dismissed fears that tourists , who flock to the reeperbahn , would be put off by the new security measure .
nagel pointed out that his administration had identified so-called " private zones " where the video cameras were off-limits .
" we 're not interested in who 's moving out of an apartment , " nagel said .
london bombings trigger security concerns nagel 's proposal to step up video surveillance in hamburg is n't a lone one .
in the weeks since bombings on london 's transport system killed 52 commuters , several european countries have vowed more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to stamp out criminal and terrorist activity .

angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democrats and the likely next chancellor , recently spoke out in favor of stepping up video surveillance .
" the londoners would have never caught their terrorists if they had n't had video cameras at underground station entrances , " merkel said during a campaign rally .
" what 's possible in london , should also be possible in germany , " she added .
two weeks ago , german interior minister otto schily presented a tightened security concept for the country 's train stations which foresees significantly expanding existing video surveillance as well as police presence .
" video surveillance has proven itself - not only in the fight against terrorism , " schily said , adding that over 700 criminal offenses had been detected last year thanks to surveillance cameras .
but hamburg is n't planning to confine its surveillance techniques to the reeperbahn alone : the interior ministry is already planning to install cameras in at least two further flashpoints in the city .
how effective are " electronic eyes ? "
criminal experts and data protection agencies however are skeptical of the effectiveness of the measures .
" video surveillance is n't a panacea .
criminality should n't just be observed but also prevented , " hartmut lubomierski , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection told spiegel online .
lubomierski added that even a city like london , which has the most dense network of surveillance cameras in europe , could not be protected from terrorist attacks .

bremen , hamburg and schalke are all chasing bayern , which is hoping to expand its early season lead . it 'll only be the fourth match day for germany 's top-flight soccer league this season , and already everybody is trying to catch fc bayern münchen .
but the defending champions are currently only two points clear of three teams that have serious title ambitions this year : werder bremen , hamburg sv , and schalke 04 .
all four clubs will be playing away this weekend , increasing the competition to come out on top .
bayern will travel to bavarian rivals 1 .
fc nürnberg , bremen heads to 1 .
fc kaiserslautern , hamburg will take on 1 .
fsv mainz 05 and schalke will go to bayern leverkusen .
bavarian derby all of those match-ups are manageable for the visitors and bayern in particular will have the motivation to show struggling nürnberg who 's boss .
if bayern win , it will be the team 's 13th consecutive victory , breaking a 24-year-old bundesliga record .
munich has won half of all the bavarian derby held in nuremberg , which will be hard pressed to keep the defending champions from at least taking a point home with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart hamburg sv will have a harder time against mainz , which won their first bundesliga points by beating the northern club after being promoted to the top-flight .
but hamburg , with a strengthened squad and new ambition , has been in impressive form early this season .
hsv 's new dutch star rafael van der vaart will almost certainly be raring to go after having a great match with his national side at the weekend .
mainz , on the other hand , is wallowing at the bottom of the table .
but the club has taken new hope from the arrival of egyptian striker mohamed zidan on loan from bremen .
" i will show what i can do , " zidan said confidently after throwing his lot in with mainz .
bremen aims high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keyplayer saison 2005/06 werder bremen thorsten frings bremen certainly does n't seem to miss him at the moment as they prepare to head to kaiserslautern .
midfielder torsten frings has returned from injury and he knows his squad needs to get the away points to avoid falling too far behind his old club bayern .
" we have to win if we want to stay put up top , " he said .
bremen is undefeated since losing 0-1 to dortmund on may 8 last season .
their victory against kaiserslautern on may 21 punched bremen 's ticket to the champions league this year .
the last match for the top four clubs is schalke 04 visiting bayern leverkusen .
normally , leverkusen would be a tough nut to crack at home , but at the moment , the club is suffering a number of injuries .
to make things worse , roque junior and marko babic are both suspended due to red cards .
schalke 's brazilian playmaker lincoln will also be rejoining his side after his own suspension for spitting in the german cup final in august .
all the matches this weekend : sept .

a third of 40-year-old women do not have children , causing politicians campaigning in germany 's election to push for a teutonic baby boom . chancellor gerhard schröder has made boosting a birthrate that is among the lowest in europe one of the key pledges of an election campaign focused on reviving germany 's moribund economy . his conservative challenger angela merkel , who looks set to become germany 's first woman chancellor , has promised a " better future for families " and financial help for parents until their children are 12 years old . if their policies differ in the detail , the right and the left both hope to breathe new life into an ageing society and avoid a future of too many pensioners and too few young earners . well-meaning but ineffective in 2004 , the average german woman had only 1.3 children , and projections show that by 2050 , a third of the population will be over the age of 60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning on a platform of children analysts say that if the incentives promised by the politicians are well-meaning , it is unlikely that they could rapidly reverse a demographic trend that has been decades in the making . they forecast that in the future almost half of those with a university education will never have children , in a country where the average life expectancy is around 76 for men and 82 for women . president horst koehler sounded the alarm in july when he gave the go-ahead for elections 12 months ahead of schedule , warning : " we have too few children and we are getting older and older . " family policy to make no difference yet the focus on family in the campaign seems to have almost no influence on how germans will vote on september 18 , according to klaus-peter schoeppner , the head of the emnid polling institute . " family policy is not expected to make any difference to the election results .
the vote is dominated by concerns about the labour market , more so still than the last one in 2002 , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has no children herself .
merkel 's christian democrats wish to preserve " the traditional family model " while schröder 's social democrats want to make life easier for working mothers and plan to create 230,000 new places in pre-schools by 2010 . the current government 's family minister , renate schmidt , has proposed new payments for parents who take time off work to care for a baby of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,230 -rrb- per month , until the child 's first birthday . the plan has been described as " impossible to finance " by ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven who is considered as childless merkel 's likely choice of family minister should she win the election . instead the conservatives are promising tax breaks for parents as well as a reduction of their monthly contributions towards the state pension funds . " financial incentives are not enough , " said josef schmid , a lecturer at the university of bamberg in southern germany .
" we need more pre-schools like there are in france , greater measures to make it easier for women to combine children with a career and more stable couples . " appreciation of children missing in a study by the federal demographics institute , 83 percent of those questioned said their main reason for not having children was the lack of a stable relationship .
some 60 percent also said they were too worried about what the future held to bring children into the world . the german press has remarked that perhaps what is missing is a general appreciation of children , not constant reminders that every newborn will eventually be a consumer and taxpayer . after all , the newspapers have said , the natural and somewhat obscure longing to have a child has little to do with state subsidies and labor market structures . " nobody wants to say out loud what is really happening , " retired demographics professor herwig birg said . he said the incentives to make more german babies have come " too late " and the ageing nature of the population has become " impossible to reverse " . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the birth-rate problem sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems .

bremen , hamburg and schalke are all chasing bayern , which is hoping to expand its early season lead . it 'll only be the fourth match day for germany 's top-flight soccer league this season , and already everybody is trying to catch fc bayern münchen .
but the defending champions are currently only two points clear of three teams that have serious title ambitions this year : werder bremen , hamburg sv , and schalke 04 .
all four clubs will be playing away this weekend , increasing the competition to come out on top .
bayern will travel to bavarian rivals 1 .
fc nürnberg , bremen heads to 1 .
fc kaiserslautern , hamburg will take on 1 .
fsv mainz 05 and schalke will go to bayern leverkusen .
bavarian derby all of those match-ups are manageable for the visitors and bayern in particular will have the motivation to show struggling nürnberg who 's boss .
if bayern win , it will be the team 's 13th consecutive victory , breaking a 24-year-old bundesliga record .
munich has won half of all the bavarian derby held in nuremberg , which will be hard pressed to keep the defending champions from at least taking a point home with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart hamburg sv will have a harder time against mainz , which won their first bundesliga points by beating the northern club after being promoted to the top-flight .
but hamburg , with a strengthened squad and new ambition , has been in impressive form early this season .
hsv 's new dutch star rafael van der vaart will almost certainly be raring to go after having a great match with his national side at the weekend .
mainz , on the other hand , is wallowing at the bottom of the table .
but the club has taken new hope from the arrival of egyptian striker mohamed zidan on loan from bremen .
" i will show what i can do , " zidan said confidently after throwing his lot in with mainz .
bremen aims high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keyplayer saison 2005/06 werder bremen thorsten frings bremen certainly does n't seem to miss him at the moment as they prepare to head to kaiserslautern .
midfielder torsten frings has returned from injury and he knows his squad needs to get the away points to avoid falling too far behind his old club bayern .
" we have to win if we want to stay put up top , " he said .
bremen is undefeated since losing 0-1 to dortmund on may 8 last season .
their victory against kaiserslautern on may 21 punched bremen 's ticket to the champions league this year .
the last match for the top four clubs is schalke 04 visiting bayern leverkusen .
normally , leverkusen would be a tough nut to crack at home , but at the moment , the club is suffering a number of injuries .
to make things worse , roque junior and marko babic are both suspended due to red cards .
schalke 's brazilian playmaker lincoln will also be rejoining his side after his own suspension for spitting in the german cup final in august .
all the matches this weekend : sept .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .
" it would be a way for us -lrb- americans and europeans -rrb- to find the energy to look beyond iraq . " us-european relations were keenly tested during the 2003 campaign to topple saddam hussein , with germany and france leading the anti-war bloc and britain , italy and spain backing washington . a desire for cooperation glenn said that though relations have since been on the mend , the katrina disaster could spur the two sides in the transatlantic divide to focus more closely on issues they agree on rather than harp on rifts exacerbated by the war in iraq . " on both sides of the atlantic , there is a desire for cooperation ... and this can only provide an opportunity for relations to come closer again , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cooperation and smiles in the future ?
danish ambassador ulrik andreas federspiel , who is leaving washington this month after five and a half years , echoed glenn 's comments in an interview published this week . " in a sad way , katrina may contribute to better transatlantic ties , " he told the washington post .
" what is common with the aftermath of 9/11 ... is the realization that the american people are also vulnerable , there are no safe havens anywhere and no one can live alone on an island . " he and others noted that in seeking foreign aid in the aftermath of the hurricane , washington had debunked a commonly held perception overseas that it could go always get by without outside help . accepting aid after initial hesitation , the united states earlier this week officially asked for emergency aid from the eu in the form of blankets , medicines , water , pumps , food rations and other items . last week , new us ambassador to germany , william r. timken , jr. met with german foreign minister joschka fischer to accept german aid .
in his first press conference a few days later , he stressed " increased cooperation " between the two nations . meanwhile , three french planes have since flown in with supplies along with aid from other countries including britain , germany , greece and the baltic states of latvia , lithuania and estonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technical experts are on their way louisiana nathalie loiseau , spokeswoman at the french embassy in washington , denied reports that washington had initially balked at paris ' offer to help and qualified the idea that katrina was a necessary catalyst for improving bilateral ties . " it would be wrong to say that a catastrophe is a golden opportunity , " she said .

" how america is governed in the end does have an impact on europe and the world , " he said .

german technical experts with high-speed water pumps , trucks and food rations have already arrived .
even if transatlantic relations have only slightly thawed in the past two years , experts say the disaster in the southern states will be a further balm , spurred by money , food , personnel and gratitude . " this may be the silver lining , what could come from katrina , " said john k. glenn , director of foreign policy at the german marshall fund of the united states , a think tank that studies and promotes transatlantic relations .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die deutsche telekom ag hat in den ersten neun monaten des jahres umsatz , gewinn und schulden gesteigert , zugleich aber die zahl der mitarbeiter weiter gesenkt .
der umsatz stieg um 14,5 prozent auf 29,3 milliarden euro .
der konzernüberschuss schoss um 546 prozent auf 8,4 milliarden euro empor .
-lrb- 31.10.00 -rrb- between 1998 and 2005 , schröder 's administration has sold off 63.6 billion euros worth of shares in former state-owned monopolies such as deutsche telekom and deutsche post .
a further 23 billion euros in privatizations have been earmarked for 2006 .
the problem for the incoming government , of whichever political persuasion , is that such one-off sources of financing are quickly drying up .
the only company still to be privatized is the state-owned railway , deutsche bahn , and that is nowhere near fit enough for the stock exchange just yet .
" the new government wo n't be able to afford any further shortfalls in tax revenues , " said johannes eeckhoff , economics professor at cologne university .

18 faces some daunting economic tasks , including bringing down unemployment and tackling germany 's burgeoning deficit . if chancellor gerhard schröder is ousted from office in just over a week , it will largely be because he failed to address germany 's joblessness - currently stuck at an alltime postwar high .
either schröder or his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will need find a way to get people back to work in the eurozone 's largest economy to help rekindle moribund domestic demand , which has been in the doldrums for years .
but the victor in the poll will also have to show germany 's eu partners that they are willing - and able - to make some progress in restoring order to the country 's public finances , which have spiralled out of control in recent years as a result of the astronomic costs of unification , runaway unemployment and chronically weak growth .
" we 're sitting on a powder keg , " the head of cologne-based economic think tank diw , winfried fuest , warned in a newspaper interview this week .
" without some drastic measures , we 'll march ever deeper into debt , " fuest , who has been asked by merkel 's christian democrats to look at the state of germany 's shaky public finances , told berlin 's daily tagesspiegel .
in 2007 alone , germany could face a structural deficit of 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- that would not be reduced by the government simply selling off more of the family silver , fuest said .
immediate spending cuts of around 8 billion euros are needed if germany is to have any chance of bringing its deficit back within the limits laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact , he estimated .
conservatives vague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof ironically , the man the conservatives have tipped to become merkel 's future finance minister , paul kirchhof , has remained frustratingly vague on the likely timetable for those efforts .
many observers believe that kirchhof 's bold plans for a drastic streamlining of the tax system would slash tens of billions of euros from public revenues and push up the german deficit ratio even more .
the situation is something of a catch-22 .
the deficit can not come down until the economic recovery becomes self-sustaining , ensuring a healthy flow of tax revenues , and unemployment comes down , lowering the cost of benefit payouts .
on the other hand , the government is fearful of cutting back further on spending so as not to choke off sluggish demand altogether .
some economists also fear cdu plans to raise germany 's value added tax - a general consumption tax - by two percentage points in order to plug the budget deficit .
such a tax hike could completely snuff out germany 's already weak domestic demand , as people stop making purchases .
selling the silverware that 's partly why the ruling center-left coalition has had such a hard time sorting out the country 's finances over the years .
as a result , much of german finance minister hans eichel 's budget consolidation efforts have been more " cosmetic " in nature , with the government selling off state assets to fill some of the gaping holes in the public purse .

" i ca n't imagine that a decision would be made in four weeks , " she told reporters as she arrived at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in newcastle , northern england . the member states committed themselves to reaching an agreement on the issue by october , following the bombings in london on july 7 , in which 52 commuters were killed during the morning rush hour . weighing security against the costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries believes more time is needed for an eu-wide agreement zypries said that several questions about the controversial measures remained unanswered , such as who will foot the potentially massive bill for keeping records on calls and e-mail for up to a year .

either the state will pay for it or the consumers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.09.2005 will the postman ring twice ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will soon be history german mail monopolist deutsche post is gaining competition in the letter delivery service .
the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .
for many , it 's a long-overdue move .
" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .
müller pointed to scandinavia as an example where letter monopolies have been absent for some years , saying increased competition would not pose problems for either deutsche post or germany at large . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post faces red-letter days on monday deutsche post was ordered to cease actions that limited competition in the pre-sorting business .
on friday , a law may be passed that could end its letter monopoly .
the company has had better weeks .

the country 's large publishing houses plan to form a joint venture to take on the postal behemoth . three german newspaper publishers , axel springer , holtzbrinck and waz -lrb- westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -rrb- , are joining forces with a luxembourg-based management consultancy firm rosalia to compete with deutsche post in the letter delivery market , they announced friday .
the four partners said in a joint statement that they were setting up a joint venture - in which they would each hold a 25-percent stake - that would compete with the semi-privatized german postal service when it loses its monopoly in the letter delivery sector at the end of 2007 .
head of the joint venture would be günter thiel , former chairman of luxembourg-based thiel logistik and most recently head of the central and eastern european activities of tnt logistics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the coming years , even before the complete disappearance of the letter-delivery monopoly at the end of 2007 , the german postal market is going to grow rapidly , " thiel said . " not only will consumers benefit in the liberalization , but the market players as well who have the corresponding know-how .
our aim is to become the clear number two in the market behind deutsche post , " thiel said .
the joint venture was set to start operations at the beginning of next year .
operations would be based in berlin , but the company 's administrative headquarters would be in luxembourg .
the venture still has to be approved by antitrust authorities , the statement said .
end in sight for post monopoly deutsche post has reacted coolly to the joint venture plans .
" that 's a normal procedure , " a spokesman told the reuters news agency , adding that the company was convinced " it was well prepared " for the period after the end of its monopoly in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company , which is a global mail and logistics giant , says the german postal market accounts for 20 percent of its turnover .
last year , deutsche post had a turnover of 43.2 billion euros .
according to federal postal law , the deutsche post has the sole right to transport letters and catalogues up to 100 grams -lrb- 3.5 oz -rrb- .
starting 2006 , deutsche post 's monopoly will only extend to letters and catalogues up to 50 grams .
by the end of 2007 , deutsche post 's monopoly will completely end and the sector will be thrown open to competition .
for many , it 's a long-overdue move .
" this crossroads for the entire abolition of the letter monopoly is a welcome step , " elmar müller , director of the german federation for post and telecommunications -lrb- dvpt -rrb- told dw-world earlier this year .
müller pointed to scandinavia as an example where letter monopolies have been absent for some years , saying increased competition would not pose problems for either deutsche post or germany at large . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post faces red-letter days on monday deutsche post was ordered to cease actions that limited competition in the pre-sorting business .
on friday , a law may be passed that could end its letter monopoly .
the company has had better weeks .

the answer is far from clear just over a week before germany heads to the polls , the death of a far-right candidate and the shrinking of the once-solid lead enjoyed by the conservatives have complicated the outcome of the general elections . the death of a neo-nazi candidate could delay the final result of germany 's sept .
18 elections and even the appointment of the country 's new chancellor by at least one week , an electoral official said thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin lorenz irene schneider-böttcher , head of the electoral commission in the eastern state of saxony , said it had been forced to delay voting in one district of dresden after the candidate of the far-right national democratic party , kerstin lorenz -lrb- photo -rrb- , died following a stroke .
a date for a new by-election to be held after the main poll had not yet been set for the city 's district with its roughly 219,000 voters . political observers have speculated that the by-election could sway the result of the whole general election if the race between the parties remains as tight as it appears at present .
" the by-election in dresden could be of decisive importance in case of a close result on sept .
18 , " federal electoral officer johann hahlen told german public television station mdr .
a grand coalition ?
signs that the outcome of the general election could indeed be a close one hardened on friday as the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , led by chancellor candidate angela merkel , and its bavarian sister party -lrb- csu -rrb- saw their support slipping further in opinion poll ratings .
a poll conducted by infratest dimap for ard public television was the third this week to show that merkel 's once-comfortable lead has diminished since a television debate with chancellor gerhard schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a cdu election poster though the cdu / csu remains the strongest party , its support has dropped to 41 percent while the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the cdu 's preferred coalition partners - came in at 6.5 percent .
that would give a center-right coalition a combined total of 47.5 percent , less than a total of 49.5 percent for all other parties in parliament .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , meanwhile , has surged to 34 percent in poll ratings , while his green party coalition partners are at 7 percent .
the left party stands at 8.5 percent .
the spd has ruled out a coalition with the left party , a recently formed grouping of former communists and spd dissenters led by oskar lafontaine .
the latest poll has added to signs that merkel might be forced into a so-called " grand coalition " with schröder 's center-left spd .
it 's an alliance that is n't welcomed by experts and industry bosses .
many fear that it could lead to political deadlock , with the spd preventing merkel from pushing through reforms of the tax system and labor market , while others worry that political bickering could lead to a dilution of the reforms schröder has made .
however , friday 's ard poll showed the idea of a grand coalition finds favor among voters .
thirty-six percent said it would be " the best thing for germany " and only 29 percent preferred a center-right coalition .
spd getting back on track ?
the previously lackluster german election campaign , largely dominated by economic issues , has been injected with some dynamism since the televised face-off between merkel and schröder last sunday .
schröder 's smooth performance in the tv debate has largely been given credit for the resurgence of the spd , which had been written off by many experts in recent months .
bildunterschrift : the spd has since gained in poll ratings on issues such as tax policy , pensions and social justice .
in a direct comparison , schröder himself - who is largely seen as media-savvy and close to the people - was well ahead of his challenger , according to the latest ard poll .
fifty-four percent of those questioned said they would vote for schröder if the vote were for the main candidate alone rather than a party .
only 35 percent said they preferred merkel .
however , the conservatives fared better than the spd on issues such as policies for the future , the economy and jobs .
though it still remains questionable whether schröder will manage to reach his stated goal of 38 percent of the vote within a week , the chancellor was optimistic friday that the spd could gain further ground .

" waiting for the barbarians " premieres on saturday in the eastern german town of erfurt . erfurt , a small city in the eastern german state of thuringia , will put itself on the world opera map this week with the premiere of a new work by american minimalist composer philip glass . " waiting for the barbarians , " a harrowing allegory of oppressor and oppressed based on the novel by 2003 nobel laureate john maxwell coetzee of south africa , opens saturday at the new erfurt theater . the theater , under the direction of guy montavon , commissioned the work , which is glass ' 15th opera . bildunterschrift : richard salter as " magistrate " -lrb- right -rrb- and eugene perry als " joll , officer " during a rehearsal for " waiting for the barbarians " cruelty on the border the story 's main protagonist , the magistrate , is a loyal servant of the empire , running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement in an unnamed country for years and ignoring the ever-present threat of war with the " barbarians , " a nomadic people demonized by his own regime . shocked by the empire 's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war , the magistrate commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state , rendering him an object of public humiliation and torture . montavon said that the two-hour opera , with a libretto by christopher hampton , contains 20 scenes and follows the novel closely .
six performances are scheduled . british baritone richard salter takes the lead role , while the cruel colonel joll will be sung by us baritone eugene perry , who has starred in a number of glass operas . " glass 's music is very harmonic and very listenable , " montavon said . bildunterschrift : the sets for " waiting for the barbarians " are by george tsypin allegory of the iraq war the composer sees the work as a criticism of the iraq war led by us president george w. bush - something that made it all the more surprising for glass when the opera was invited to hold its us premiere in austin , texas in january 2007 . " we were very surprised by the invitation " , he told germany 's dpa news agency . " but austin is n't texas , " he said , adding that bush 's policies were not as hotly disputed now as during the height of the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt theater opened in 2003 glass praised the erfurt theater for staging the work and for its commitment to contemporary music theater in general . he also lauded the theater 's musical standards , noting that the chorus and orchestra were able to recreate his sound world without any difficulty . " this sort of openness is not always found in other opera houses , " he said . ambitious project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern erfurt theater cost 60 million euros to complete erfurt managed to entice us maestro dennis russell davies - who has conducted many glass premieres - for the production . " he is the best midwife for my pieces , " the composer said . the sets are by russian theater designer , george tsypin , and the costumes are by german designer hank irwin kittel . glass said he likes to maintain links with opera houses that have performed his works and he could imagine returning to erfurt in the future . opened in september 2003 , the erfurt theater took four years to build .
it is comprised of a main auditorium with 800 seats and a smaller studio stage with 200 seats . it is the first new theater built in the former east germany since 1960 , and is the biggest new theater built anywhere in germany since 1995 . additional performances of " waiting for the barbarians " will take place on sept .

a third of 40-year-old women do not have children , causing politicians campaigning in germany 's election to push for a teutonic baby boom . chancellor gerhard schröder has made boosting a birthrate that is among the lowest in europe one of the key pledges of an election campaign focused on reviving germany 's moribund economy . his conservative challenger angela merkel , who looks set to become germany 's first woman chancellor , has promised a " better future for families " and financial help for parents until their children are 12 years old . if their policies differ in the detail , the right and the left both hope to breathe new life into an ageing society and avoid a future of too many pensioners and too few young earners . well-meaning but ineffective in 2004 , the average german woman had only 1.3 children , and projections show that by 2050 , a third of the population will be over the age of 60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning on a platform of children analysts say that if the incentives promised by the politicians are well-meaning , it is unlikely that they could rapidly reverse a demographic trend that has been decades in the making . they forecast that in the future almost half of those with a university education will never have children , in a country where the average life expectancy is around 76 for men and 82 for women . president horst koehler sounded the alarm in july when he gave the go-ahead for elections 12 months ahead of schedule , warning : " we have too few children and we are getting older and older . " family policy to make no difference yet the focus on family in the campaign seems to have almost no influence on how germans will vote on september 18 , according to klaus-peter schoeppner , the head of the emnid polling institute . " family policy is not expected to make any difference to the election results .
the vote is dominated by concerns about the labour market , more so still than the last one in 2002 , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has no children herself .
merkel 's christian democrats wish to preserve " the traditional family model " while schröder 's social democrats want to make life easier for working mothers and plan to create 230,000 new places in pre-schools by 2010 . the current government 's family minister , renate schmidt , has proposed new payments for parents who take time off work to care for a baby of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,230 -rrb- per month , until the child 's first birthday . the plan has been described as " impossible to finance " by ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven who is considered as childless merkel 's likely choice of family minister should she win the election . instead the conservatives are promising tax breaks for parents as well as a reduction of their monthly contributions towards the state pension funds . " financial incentives are not enough , " said josef schmid , a lecturer at the university of bamberg in southern germany .
" we need more pre-schools like there are in france , greater measures to make it easier for women to combine children with a career and more stable couples . " appreciation of children missing in a study by the federal demographics institute , 83 percent of those questioned said their main reason for not having children was the lack of a stable relationship .
some 60 percent also said they were too worried about what the future held to bring children into the world . the german press has remarked that perhaps what is missing is a general appreciation of children , not constant reminders that every newborn will eventually be a consumer and taxpayer . after all , the newspapers have said , the natural and somewhat obscure longing to have a child has little to do with state subsidies and labor market structures . " nobody wants to say out loud what is really happening , " retired demographics professor herwig birg said . he said the incentives to make more german babies have come " too late " and the ageing nature of the population has become " impossible to reverse " . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : tackling the birth-rate problem sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems .

the victims were named locally as driver natalie malpas , 20 , her brother marc , 16 , and friends , brothers aaron and gavin matthews , aged 16 and 19 .
they died when their yellow renault megane hit a wall near ammanford in carmarthenshire on wednesday night .
a police investigation is continuing into the cause of the accident .
people living in houses near the crash scene said they had been campaigning for years for additional traffic calming measures .
david harries , owner of the property hit by the car , said he had intended to send a letter to both the council and the police calling for action along the straight stretch of road .
" my first reaction after the accident was one of utter disbelief , " mr harries said on thursday .
he added : " it is ironic that i was going to send off that letter today .
it was only typed up yesterday . "
mr harries said there had been two accidents on the stretch of road in the last month and residents had written to police before .
dyfed-powys police added that , as well as a coroner 's inquest , there will be a multi-agency inquiry into the need for further traffic calming at the site .
police said they were looking at " all possible causes " for the crash on a straight section of the pontamman road .
initial reports suggest the car veered across the road and mounted the kerb on the opposite side of the carriageway about 50 yards before the smash , before heading towards the wall of a bungalow .
eyewitness reports say the car flipped over onto its roof and debris was scattered in neighbouring gardens .
all four victims , who had been playing pool at a local pub before the accident , were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics .
marc 's 15-year-old girlfriend rachel meed said she had seen him just minutes before the crash .
the malpas family are originally from kent and had only recently moved to the area , while the matthews brothers were originally from the bridgend area .
the driver , natalie malpas , was the mother of an 18-month-old boy .
insp tom edwards said that it was at the very early stages of investigation but they were " looking at all possible causes " and that speeding could not be ruled in or out .
" i ca n't confirm that speed was in any way a contributory factor in connection with this particular incident , " he said .
he confirmed there had been four accidents that resulted in injuries on that stretch of road in the last five years .
police have appealed for witnesses to the accident to contact ammanford police station on 0845 3302000 .

the victims were named locally as driver natalie malpas , 20 , her brother marc , 16 , and friends , brothers aaron and gavin matthews , aged 16 and 19 .
they died when their yellow renault megane hit a wall near ammanford in carmarthenshire on wednesday night .
a police investigation is continuing into the cause of the accident .
people living in houses near the crash scene said they had been campaigning for years for additional traffic calming measures .
marc malpas and aaron matthews were killed in the crash david harries , owner of the property hit by the car , said he had intended to send a letter to both the council and the police calling for action along the straight stretch of road .
" my first reaction after the accident was one of utter disbelief , " mr harries said on thursday .
he added : " it is ironic that i was going to send off that letter today .
it was only typed up yesterday . "
mr harries said there had been two accidents on the stretch of road in the last month and residents had written to police before .
dyfed-powys police added that , as well as a coroner 's inquest , there will be a multi-agency inquiry into the need for further traffic calming at the site .
police said they were looking at " all possible causes " for the crash on a straight section of the pontamman road .
initial reports suggest the car veered across the road and mounted the kerb on the opposite side of the carriageway about 50 yards before the smash , before heading towards the wall of a bungalow .
eyewitness reports say the car flipped over onto its roof and debris was scattered in neighbouring gardens .
it is thought the car crashed after mounting a kerb all four victims , who had been playing pool at a local pub before the accident , were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics .
marc 's 15-year-old girlfriend rachel meed said she had seen him just minutes before the crash .
the malpas family are originally from kent and had only recently moved to the area , while the matthews brothers were originally from the bridgend area .
the driver , natalie malpas , was the mother of an 18-month-old boy .
insp tom edwards said that it was at the very early stages of investigation but they were " looking at all possible causes " and that speeding could not be ruled in or out .
" i ca n't confirm that speed was in any way a contributory factor in connection with this particular incident , " he said .
he confirmed there had been four accidents that resulted in injuries on that stretch of road in the last five years .
police have appealed for witnesses to the accident to contact ammanford police station on 0845 3302000 .

shelter cymru said homelessness in wales had grown by 57 % in the past three years , at the same time as 16,000 council homes have been sold .
the charity said that right-to-buy schemes had contributed , with other factors , to a shortage of " affordable " housing in wales .
right-to-buy schemes allow tenants to buy their homes from local authorities .
the growth in recorded homelessness in wales is overwhelmingly because of the lack of enough affordable homes john puzey , shelter cymru shelter cymru director john puzey said a reduction in the number of available council homes was a factor in the increase of homelessness .
" the growth in recorded homelessness in wales is overwhelmingly because of the lack of enough affordable homes , " he said .
" one of the main causes has been house price inflation and a lack of new social rented homes , but the constant haemorrhaging of council homes through the right to buy has also had a significant impact . "
' suspension necessary ' the charity added that it acknowledged that the right-to-buy scheme had allowed people who may not have been able to move onto the home ownership ladder .
but it claimed that , by reducing the level of rented housing , right-to-buy had also contributed to homelessness and forced many people to leave rural communities .
it added that in the last 25 years , 130,000 council homes had been sold , reducing council stock for rent by 42 % .
shelter cymru , which helps more than 17,000 people with housing problems in wales every year , said it believed the welsh assembly government should be given powers to suspend council house tenants ' right to buy their homes in some areas .
mr puzey added : " the assembly government has ... called for powers to be given them which will allow the suspension of the right to buy in areas of housing pressure .
" we strongly support this call and believe in the current housing climate that suspension will be necessary for a time in many parts of wales . "

finance ministers and central bankers are meeting in manchester in their first talks since katrina pushed crude oil prices to record levels .
the eu policy-makers are expected to look at how to limit the impact of high petrol , diesel and raw material costs .
they will also discuss ways to increase development aid and best use subsidies .
areas of interest will be how to increase help to the west bank and gaza strip , as well as the best way to proceed with the international financing facility -lrb- iff -rrb- promoted by uk chancellor gordon brown .
mr brown is expected to make a separate announcement on friday morning about the extension of the iff , which aims to borrow money against aid budgets , to fund vaccines and medicines for developing countries .
talking shop a number of business leaders have been lined up to address the ministers and central bankers about the importance of reform and generating economic momentum .
taking part in the meeting are arun sarin , boss of phone firm vodafone , patrick cescau , head of consumer goods maker unilever , and bart becht , chief of household cleaner manufacturer reckitt benckiser .
belgian economist andre sapir , who has called for the radical reform of the eu 's budget , also has been invited to speak .
but the embattled bank of italy president antonio fazio has decided not to attend the meeting .
mr fazio is under increasing pressure to resign and would have had to come face to face with italy 's economy minister domenico siniscalco , one of the people calling most loudly for his resignation .
no clear picture recent reports have shown a mixed picture emerging from some of the eu 's largest economies .
companies , by and large , have seen profits grow as measures such as price increases and staff cuts have lifted the bottom line .
however , the cost cutting has had a negative effect and the unemployment rate in france and germany is stuck close to 10 % , while consumer and business confidence is proving fragile and fickle .
italy is struggling and the stagnant state of its economy is putting pressure on the government of prime minister silvio berlusconi .
and all three countries are in breach of the eurozone 's 3 % budget deficit limit .
conditions in the uk are better , but alarm bells have been sounded by some analysts , worried that high levels of personal borrowing , a slowdown in house price growth and high petrol prices will combine to hamper growth .
price impact on thursday , the bank of england left its benchmark interest rate at 4.5 % , having cut it by a quarter of a percentage point the previous month .
the european central bank has held its rates at 2 % for more than two years , and president jean-claude trichet recently reiterated his view that borrowing costs are at the right level .
industry groups have increased calls for an interest rate cut , and analysts said ministers and bankers should have plenty to talk about in manchester .
" ministers will discuss the development of oil prices and its implications for growth and they will try to identify policy responses , " a diplomatic source told the reuters news agency .
" they will discuss if it is necessary to compensate for the impact of oil prices in the short-term , and talk about energy policy in the long term , " reuters quoted the source as saying .
" they will also talk about how to handle sectors of the economy that are regularly asking for interventions . "

but it could be here that the next general election - just a week away - could be decided .
the statistics are bleak .
germany 's ' aufbau ost ' - the rebuilding of eastern germany - has cost an estimated 1.25 trillion euro -lrb- £ 843bn , $ 1,550bn -rrb- so far .
despite the capital injection , the east 's unemployment rate is still 18.6 % - in many regions it tops 25 % .
the economy grows by about 5.5 % a year , but from a very low base - and that is not enough to create many new jobs .
east germany population 1989:16.7m population 2004:15.3m unemployment : 18.6 % germany 's new ' laender ' brandenburg mecklenburg-vorpommern saxony saxony-anhalt thuringia is germany 's economy recovering ?
how firms fight the slump as a result the east is emptying .
since unification some 1.4 million people have moved to the west , most of them young and well-educated .
take halle in saxony-anhalt .
once a town of more than 315,000 people and dominated by its chemical industry , it has lost nearly a fifth of its citizens .
it is a far cry from what the " chancellor of unity " , helmut kohl , promised in july 1990 : " in a joint effort we will soon turn -lsb- the east german regions -rsb- mecklenburg-vorpommern and saxony-anhalt , brandenburg , saxony and thuringia into flourishing landscapes . "
kohl failed , as did his 1998 replacement , gerhard schroeder .
soon the job might fall to an east german , angela merkel , kohl 's successor as party leader of the right-wing cdu and tipped to win the elections on 18 september .
the new east germany of course not all is bad .
jena 's students and economic success have made it a modern city these days it is difficult to spot where the west ends and the east begins .
the acrid smell of the east 's polluting chemical industry is gone ; its industrial ruins have disappeared .
autobahns are not potholed any more .
grand bourgeois houses , many riddled with world war ii bullet holes until 1989 , have been restored to their old glory .
generous subsidies have attracted nearly 2,000 foreign investors including bmw , volkswagen , general motors , amd and motorola .
but there have also been plenty of spectacular failures , especially in the brandenburg region around the capital berlin .
the result is a patchwork economy , where vibrant cities like jena are neighbours to dreary and shrinking towns like gera , which could easily double up as background for a movie set in communist east germany , circa 1984 .
" in towns like gera and -lsb- nearby -rsb- altenburg nearly every family has been touched by unemployment , " reports dr stefan russwurm , who runs bio technology start-up sirs-lab down the road in jena .
marx reloaded these economically depressed areas are turning into breeding grounds for political disaffection , where voters drift towards far-left and far-right parties .
east germany 's former communists are riding high in the polls hans-juergen schneider , a 49-year-old trained engineer has been unemployed since january 2004 .
he has sent out 286 job applications since then , without success .
" the market economy ca n't solve our problems , " he says , " big business is just grabbing the profits without accepting any responsibility . "
he is not alone ; 73 % of east germans believe that karl marx 's critique of capitalism is still valid , according to a recent poll by news magazine der spiegel .
the pds , successor to the east german communists and now campaigning as " the left party " , is expected to get more than 30 % of the vote here .
society of envy " the people do n't see a future , the country 's mood is gloomy , " warns gerhard schade , boss of jena-based asi .
dr ute bergner : ' we 've turned into a society of envy ' during the past 10 years he has grown his company from a couple of people to 206 employees installing and maintaining heating and air-conditioning systems , fitting kitchens and bathrooms , and more .
however most people in the east are afraid of taking risks , mr schade says .
" entrepreneurs are maligned as nasty exploiters , especially here in eastern germany , " says dr ute bergner , founder of vacom , a firm specialising in vacuum technologies .
" we have turned into a society of envy , " she says .
the collapse this is the fallout from the collapse of communism , reverberating around the country 15 years on .
before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , the " chemical triangle " leuna-halle-bitterfeld gave employment to 100,000 people - now 10,000 jobs remain .
seven case studies that show how german companies are beating the slump at-a-glance gera once had large textiles and defence industries , and some uranium mining .
they have gone , and much the same happened in most other state-owned industries since 1989 .
east germany 's industries turned out to be much less competitive and productive than most had assumed .
and east germans were allowed to swap their currency one-for-one with west german deutschmarks .
this combined to make most state-owned industries unviable .
another mistake was the decision to transplant the west 's cumbersome bureaucracy .
the biggest mistake was to spread the investments -lsb- in east germany -rsb- across the region alexander von witzleben , jenoptik " when an investor from abroad comes to germany , he 'll shake his head when he sees all that red tape , " says dr bergner .
subsidies are another problem .
the region is rife with stories of firms that invested in the east only to pull out as soon as the subsidies stopped flowing .
some companies were able to compete only on the strength of their subsidies , says asi 's mr schade , but quickly went bust once this money was used up .
no focus but east germany 's biggest problem was a lack of focus .
" the biggest mistake was to spread the investments -lsb- in east germany -rsb- across the region .
the government made infrastructure investments where they were not needed , " says alexander von witzleben , boss of thuringian high-tech company jenoptik .
bereft of industry , gera has failed to develop it triggered a boom-and-bust in east germany 's construction industry , and wasted money because the investments failed to create self-sustaining industries .
just look at the number of jobless , says dr russwurm of sirs-lab .
" saxony and thuringia focused their investments on a few industry clusters and small and medium-sized companies .
today they have the lowest rates of unemployment in the east , " he says .
his words are echoed by mr von witzleben : " governments should have ... waited for the spill-over effects from these areas . "
the rebuilding in west germany the average working hour costs 28.14 euro ; east german companies have to spend a third less , just 17.15 euro , according to cologne 's institute of german industry .
combined with cheaper living costs and a brand-new infrastructure , the east is getting attractive for some investors .
already a new chemical industry is emerging around leuna , an automotive industry is re-energising dresden and eisenach , while jena attracts a cluster of firms and know-how in precision engineering , opto-electronics and biotechnology .
industry clusters lift a whole region , says biocentiv 's klaus ullrich but it wo n't happen fast .
high-tech firms are not very staff intensive , but towns like jena " live from their presence and the local buying power they bring , " says dr klaus ullrich of biocentiv , a science park designed to attract biotech firms to the city .
it will take " a generation to replace the collapsed industries -lsb- of eastern germany -rsb- , " says mr von witzleben , and " there are regions that have n't made the necessary structural changes yet " .
but it may require more than a better industrial policy - people 's attitude 's also need to change .
thirteen years ago vacom 's ute bergner decided to set up her own company in jena after working for a swiss firm for a year .
" i manufacture in germany because i was born here and i believe in the future of my homeland ... our children and grand children want to be able to earn a living too , " she says .
eastern germany needs many ute bergners .
this is the third in a series of reports from germany ; in the run-up to the election we are also looking at the country 's economy , its unemployed , and how its companies are trying to beat the slump .

but it could be here that the next general election - just a week away - could be decided .
the statistics are bleak .
germany 's ' aufbau ost ' - the rebuilding of eastern germany - has cost an estimated 1.25 trillion euro -lrb- £ 843bn , $ 1,550bn -rrb- so far .
despite the capital injection , the east 's unemployment rate is still 18.6 % - in many regions it tops 25 % .
the economy grows by about 5.5 % a year , but from a very low base - and that is not enough to create many new jobs .
east germany population 1989:16.7m population 2004:15.3m unemployment : 18.6 % germany 's new ' laender ' brandenburg mecklenburg-vorpommern saxony saxony-anhalt thuringia is germany 's economy recovering ?

take halle in saxony-anhalt .
once a town of more than 315,000 people and dominated by its chemical industry , it has lost nearly a fifth of its citizens .
it is a far cry from what the " chancellor of unity " , helmut kohl , promised in july 1990 : " in a joint effort we will soon turn -lsb- the east german regions -rsb- mecklenburg-vorpommern and saxony-anhalt , brandenburg , saxony and thuringia into flourishing landscapes . "
kohl failed , as did his 1998 replacement , gerhard schroeder .
soon the job might fall to an east german , angela merkel , kohl 's successor as party leader of the right-wing cdu and tipped to win the elections on 18 september .

he is not alone ; 73 % of east germans believe that karl marx 's critique of capitalism is still valid , according to a recent poll by news magazine der spiegel .

but it could be here that the next general election - just a week away - could be decided .
the statistics are bleak .
germany 's ' aufbau ost ' - the rebuilding of eastern germany - has cost an estimated 1.25 trillion euro -lrb- £ 843bn , $ 1,550bn -rrb- so far .
despite the capital injection , the east 's unemployment rate is still 18.6 % - in many regions it tops 25 % .
the economy grows by about 5.5 % a year , but from a very low base - and that is not enough to create many new jobs .
east germany population 1989:16.7m population 2004:15.3m unemployment : 18.6 % germany 's new ' laender ' brandenburg mecklenburg-vorpommern saxony saxony-anhalt thuringia is germany 's economy recovering ?
how firms fight the slump as a result the east is emptying .
since unification some 1.4 million people have moved to the west , most of them young and well-educated .
take halle in saxony-anhalt .
once a town of more than 315,000 people and dominated by its chemical industry , it has lost nearly a fifth of its citizens .
it is a far cry from what the " chancellor of unity " , helmut kohl , promised in july 1990 : " in a joint effort we will soon turn -lsb- the east german regions -rsb- mecklenburg-vorpommern and saxony-anhalt , brandenburg , saxony and thuringia into flourishing landscapes . "
kohl failed , as did his 1998 replacement , gerhard schroeder .
soon the job might fall to an east german , angela merkel , kohl 's successor as party leader of the right-wing cdu and tipped to win the elections on 18 september .
the new east germany of course not all is bad .
jena 's students and economic success have made it a modern city these days it is difficult to spot where the west ends and the east begins .
the acrid smell of the east 's polluting chemical industry is gone ; its industrial ruins have disappeared .
autobahns are not potholed any more .
grand bourgeois houses , many riddled with world war ii bullet holes until 1989 , have been restored to their old glory .
generous subsidies have attracted nearly 2,000 foreign investors including bmw , volkswagen , general motors , amd and motorola .
but there have also been plenty of spectacular failures , especially in the brandenburg region around the capital berlin .
the result is a patchwork economy , where vibrant cities like jena are neighbours to dreary and shrinking towns like gera , which could easily double up as background for a movie set in communist east germany , circa 1984 .
" in towns like gera and -lsb- nearby -rsb- altenburg nearly every family has been touched by unemployment , " reports dr stefan russwurm , who runs bio technology start-up sirs-lab down the road in jena .
marx reloaded these economically depressed areas are turning into breeding grounds for political disaffection , where voters drift towards far-left and far-right parties .
east germany 's former communists are riding high in the polls hans-juergen schneider , a 49-year-old trained engineer has been unemployed since january 2004 .
he has sent out 286 job applications since then , without success .
" the market economy ca n't solve our problems , " he says , " big business is just grabbing the profits without accepting any responsibility . "
he is not alone ; 73 % of east germans believe that karl marx 's critique of capitalism is still valid , according to a recent poll by news magazine der spiegel .
the pds , successor to the east german communists and now campaigning as " the left party " , is expected to get more than 30 % of the vote here .
society of envy " the people do n't see a future , the country 's mood is gloomy , " warns gerhard schade , boss of jena-based asi .
dr ute bergner : ' we 've turned into a society of envy ' during the past 10 years he has grown his company from a couple of people to 206 employees installing and maintaining heating and air-conditioning systems , fitting kitchens and bathrooms , and more .
however most people in the east are afraid of taking risks , mr schade says .
" entrepreneurs are maligned as nasty exploiters , especially here in eastern germany , " says dr ute bergner , founder of vacom , a firm specialising in vacuum technologies .
" we have turned into a society of envy , " she says .
the collapse this is the fallout from the collapse of communism , reverberating around the country 15 years on .
before the berlin wall came down in 1989 , the " chemical triangle " leuna-halle-bitterfeld gave employment to 100,000 people - now 10,000 jobs remain .
seven case studies that show how german companies are beating the slump at-a-glance gera once had large textiles and defence industries , and some uranium mining .
they have gone , and much the same happened in most other state-owned industries since 1989 .
east germany 's industries turned out to be much less competitive and productive than most had assumed .
and east germans were allowed to swap their currency one-for-one with west german deutschmarks .
this combined to make most state-owned industries unviable .
another mistake was the decision to transplant the west 's cumbersome bureaucracy .
the biggest mistake was to spread the investments -lsb- in east germany -rsb- across the region alexander von witzleben , jenoptik " when an investor from abroad comes to germany , he 'll shake his head when he sees all that red tape , " says dr bergner .
subsidies are another problem .
the region is rife with stories of firms that invested in the east only to pull out as soon as the subsidies stopped flowing .
some companies were able to compete only on the strength of their subsidies , says asi 's mr schade , but quickly went bust once this money was used up .
no focus but east germany 's biggest problem was a lack of focus .
" the biggest mistake was to spread the investments -lsb- in east germany -rsb- across the region .
the government made infrastructure investments where they were not needed , " says alexander von witzleben , boss of thuringian high-tech company jenoptik .
bereft of industry , gera has failed to develop it triggered a boom-and-bust in east germany 's construction industry , and wasted money because the investments failed to create self-sustaining industries .
just look at the number of jobless , says dr russwurm of sirs-lab .
" saxony and thuringia focused their investments on a few industry clusters and small and medium-sized companies .
today they have the lowest rates of unemployment in the east , " he says .
his words are echoed by mr von witzleben : " governments should have ... waited for the spill-over effects from these areas . "
the rebuilding in west germany the average working hour costs 28.14 euro ; east german companies have to spend a third less , just 17.15 euro , according to cologne 's institute of german industry .
combined with cheaper living costs and a brand-new infrastructure , the east is getting attractive for some investors .
already a new chemical industry is emerging around leuna , an automotive industry is re-energising dresden and eisenach , while jena attracts a cluster of firms and know-how in precision engineering , opto-electronics and biotechnology .
industry clusters lift a whole region , says biocentiv 's klaus ullrich but it wo n't happen fast .
high-tech firms are not very staff intensive , but towns like jena " live from their presence and the local buying power they bring , " says dr klaus ullrich of biocentiv , a science park designed to attract biotech firms to the city .
it will take " a generation to replace the collapsed industries -lsb- of eastern germany -rsb- , " says mr von witzleben , and " there are regions that have n't made the necessary structural changes yet " .
but it may require more than a better industrial policy - people 's attitude 's also need to change .
thirteen years ago vacom 's ute bergner decided to set up her own company in jena after working for a swiss firm for a year .
" i manufacture in germany because i was born here and i believe in the future of my homeland ... our children and grand children want to be able to earn a living too , " she says .
eastern germany needs many ute bergners .
this is the third in a series of reports from germany ; in the run-up to the election we are also looking at the country 's economy , its unemployed , and how its companies are trying to beat the slump .

the human fertilisation and embryology has reversed its ban on the controversial proposal from the university of newcastle .
the researchers will transfer genetic material created when an egg and sperm fuse into another woman 's egg .
the groundbreaking work aims to prevent mothers from passing certain genetic diseases on to their unborn babies .
such diseases arise from dna found outside the nucleus , and thus inherited separately from dna in the nucleus .
they are collectively called mitochondrial diseases .
mitochondria are small complex structures , which exist in every cell of the body , except red blood cells .
they are responsible for producing the energy that we need to grow and live . "
the innovative approach being tested may lead to a treatment for mitochondrial myopathies " dr david harrison of the muscular dystrophy campaign q & a : two mother embryo one unique feature of mitochondria is that they have their own dna - mitochondrial dna , which is inherited from the mother only .
if this dna is faulty , a mitochondrial diseases occurs .
at present , no treatment for mitochondrial diseases exists .
studies in mice show it is possible to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease by moving the pronuclei - the genetic material which will go on to form a nucleus - from a fertilised egg containing bad mitochondria and putting it into another fertilised egg which only contains good mitochondria .
professor doug turnbull , professor of neurology at newcastle university , and dr mary herbert , scientific director of newcastle fertility centre at the city 's centre for life , now plan to do the same in humans .
us scientists at the institute for reproductive medicine and science of st barnabas , new jersey , reported back in 2001 that they had successfully done similar , giving rise to 15 healthy children who appeared to be free of their mothers ' disease .
safety check instead of transplanting the pronuclei , these researchers injected another woman 's ooplasm - the substance inside the cell that contains the mitochondrial dna and bathes the nucleus - into the egg cell of the mother with faulty mitochondrial dna .
the uk research , funded by the muscular dystrophy campaign , will check that transplanting the pro-nuclei works and is safe .
the resulting egg would never be allowed to develop into a baby .
but even if it did , the offspring would still resemble their mother and father because the mitochondrial dna does not dictate things like hair colour .
the researchers stress that this research is only the very first step in a very difficult process , which they hope will lead to techniques that might prevent the transmission of mitochondrial dna disease .
about one in 5,000 children and adults are at risk of developing a mitochondrial disease . "
the hfea does not have any regard for public consultation and the views of the public " josephine quintavalle from comment on reproductive ethics the group of conditions professor turnbull 's team will look at is called mitochondrial myopathy .
these cause muscle weakness and wasting , making it difficult for those who have it to move normally - some may need to use a wheelchair .
the muscular dystrophy campaign said it was delighted that the hfea had given approval for the research project .
head of research dr david harrison said : " the innovative approach being tested by professor turnbull may lead to a treatment for mitochondrial myopathies , a group of conditions that dramatically affect quality and length of life . "
the public are currently being consulted about their opinions on laws governing embryo research such as this .
some believe it is dangerous and unethical to carry out such work on human embryos and cells .
debate josephine quintavalle from comment on reproductive ethics said she was horrified .
" this shows once again that the hfea does not have any regard for public consultation and the views of the public .
" it is undesirable to create children in this way .
it will shock the world .
this is playing around with early human life . "
matthew o ¿ gorman , for the charity life , said : " this decision is utterly unethical , abhorrent and contrary to public opinion .
" the hfea are relentlessly imposing their libertarian agenda on the people of this country against their wishes : the government must act to disband it immediately . "
professor turnbull said they were not radically altering an embryo 's dna .
" we are simply changing the energy source . "
professor azim surani , professor of physiology and reproduction at cambridge university , said : " i see few ethical problems as we are dealing with the embryo at a very early stage where the cells have n't even started to divide yet . "
dr andy miah , ethicist at paisley university , said : " many of the more controversial ethical concerns arise only if we project into the future and imagine that a child were to be born , as a result of this kind of procedure .
" even if a child were born with ' two mothers ' , i doubt very much that we should be concerned about its welfare any more than we are concerned about the welfare of all children . "

the human fertilisation and embryology has reversed its ban on the controversial proposal from the university of newcastle .
the researchers will transfer genetic material created when an egg and sperm fuse into another woman 's egg .
the groundbreaking work aims to prevent mothers from passing certain genetic diseases on to their unborn babies .
such diseases arise from dna found outside the nucleus , and thus inherited separately from dna in the nucleus .
they are collectively called mitochondrial diseases .
mitochondria are small complex structures , which exist in every cell of the body , except red blood cells .
they are responsible for producing the energy that we need to grow and live .
the innovative approach being tested may lead to a treatment for mitochondrial myopathies dr david harrison of the muscular dystrophy campaign q & a : two mother embryo one unique feature of mitochondria is that they have their own dna - mitochondrial dna , which is inherited from the mother only .
if this dna is faulty , a mitochondrial diseases occurs .
at present , no treatment for mitochondrial diseases exists .
studies in mice show it is possible to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease by moving the pronuclei - the genetic material which will go on to form a nucleus - from a fertilised egg containing bad mitochondria and putting it into another fertilised egg which only contains good mitochondria .
professor doug turnbull , professor of neurology at newcastle university , and dr mary herbert , scientific director of newcastle fertility centre at the city 's centre for life , now plan to do the same in humans .
us scientists at the institute for reproductive medicine and science of st barnabas , new jersey , reported back in 2001 that they had successfully done similar , giving rise to 15 healthy children who appeared to be free of their mothers ' disease .
safety check instead of transplanting the pronuclei , these researchers injected another woman 's ooplasm - the substance inside the cell that contains the mitochondrial dna and bathes the nucleus - into the egg cell of the mother with faulty mitochondrial dna .
the uk research , funded by the muscular dystrophy campaign , will check that transplanting the pro-nuclei works and is safe .
the resulting egg would never be allowed to develop into a baby .
but even if it did , the offspring would still resemble their mother and father because the mitochondrial dna does not dictate things like hair colour .
the researchers stress that this research is only the very first step in a very difficult process , which they hope will lead to techniques that might prevent the transmission of mitochondrial dna disease .
about one in 5,000 children and adults are at risk of developing a mitochondrial disease .
the hfea does not have any regard for public consultation and the views of the public josephine quintavalle from comment on reproductive ethics the group of conditions professor turnbull 's team will look at is called mitochondrial myopathy .
these cause muscle weakness and wasting , making it difficult for those who have it to move normally - some may need to use a wheelchair .
the muscular dystrophy campaign said it was delighted that the hfea had given approval for the research project .
head of research dr david harrison said : " the innovative approach being tested by professor turnbull may lead to a treatment for mitochondrial myopathies , a group of conditions that dramatically affect quality and length of life . "
the public are currently being consulted about their opinions on laws governing embryo research such as this .
some believe it is dangerous and unethical to carry out such work on human embryos and cells .
debate josephine quintavalle from comment on reproductive ethics said she was horrified .
" this shows once again that the hfea does not have any regard for public consultation and the views of the public .
" it is undesirable to create children in this way .
it will shock the world .
this is playing around with early human life . "
matthew o ¿ gorman , for the charity life , said : " this decision is utterly unethical , abhorrent and contrary to public opinion .
" the hfea are relentlessly imposing their libertarian agenda on the people of this country against their wishes : the government must act to disband it immediately . "
professor turnbull said they were not radically altering an embryo 's dna .
" we are simply changing the energy source . "
professor azim surani , professor of physiology and reproduction at cambridge university , said : " i see few ethical problems as we are dealing with the embryo at a very early stage where the cells have n't even started to divide yet . "
dr andy miah , ethicist at paisley university , said : " many of the more controversial ethical concerns arise only if we project into the future and imagine that a child were to be born , as a result of this kind of procedure .
" even if a child were born with ' two mothers ' , i doubt very much that we should be concerned about its welfare any more than we are concerned about the welfare of all children . "

some believe it is dangerous and unethical to carry out such work on human embryos and cells .
debate josephine quintavalle from comment on reproductive ethics said she was horrified .
" this shows once again that the hfea does not have any regard for public consultation and the views of the public .
" it is undesirable to create children in this way .
it will shock the world .
this is playing around with early human life . "
matthew o ¿ gorman , for the charity life , said : " this decision is utterly unethical , abhorrent and contrary to public opinion .
" the hfea are relentlessly imposing their libertarian agenda on the people of this country against their wishes : the government must act to disband it immediately . "
professor turnbull said they were not radically altering an embryo 's dna .
" we are simply changing the energy source . "
professor azim surani , professor of physiology and reproduction at cambridge university , said : " i see few ethical problems as we are dealing with the embryo at a very early stage where the cells have n't even started to divide yet . "
dr andy miah , ethicist at paisley university , said : " many of the more controversial ethical concerns arise only if we project into the future and imagine that a child were to be born , as a result of this kind of procedure .
" even if a child were born with ' two mothers ' , i doubt very much that we should be concerned about its welfare any more than we are concerned about the welfare of all children . "

the 360 will have security built directly into the hardware , said xbox engineer chris satchell .
fans have modified the first xbox to turn it into a media centre , upgrade the hard drive or allow it to play imported games .
modifying a console is illegal in the uk if this is intended to get around anti-piracy measures on the xbox .
consoles such as the xbox and playstation 2 can be modified by chips that are soldered to a console 's main circuit board to bypass copyright controls .
the chips allow people to play games purchased legitimately in other countries , as well as running backup copies or bootleg discs .
shortly after the first xbox came out , computer scientists , smart amateur engineers and others started taking it apart and creating modification chips and software for the machine to make it do things microsoft never intended it to .
custom design such actions are frowned upon by the hardware manufacturers .

" one of the reasons we went with custom hardware design for all our silicon is that it allows us to build security at the silicon level , " he told the bbc news website .
" there are going to be levels of security in this box that the hacker community has never seen before . "
part of the motivation behind this is to prevent people from using the 360 to watch pirated films or tv shows .
but mr satchell admitted no system was fool-proof and that , with enough time and dedication , the security on the xbox 360 would be broken .
" there 're some really bright people in the world with some really expensive hardware , " he said .
" i 'm sure sooner or later someone will work out how to circumvent security .
but the way we have done the design does n't mean that it will work on somebody else 's machine . "
microsoft 's 360 is set to be the first of the new wave of games machines to hit the shops sometime before christmas .
the basic xbox 360 , dubbed the core system , will retail for $ 299 in the us , 299 euros in europe and £ 209 in the uk .

fans have modified the first xbox to turn it into a media centre , upgrade the hard drive or allow it to play imported games .
modifying a console is illegal in the uk if this is intended to get around anti-piracy measures on the xbox .
consoles such as the xbox and playstation 2 can be modified by chips that are soldered to a console 's main circuit board to bypass copyright controls .
the chips allow people to play games purchased legitimately in other countries , as well as running backup copies or bootleg discs .
shortly after the first xbox came out , computer scientists , smart amateur engineers and others started taking it apart and creating modification chips and software for the machine to make it do things microsoft never intended it to .
custom design such actions are frowned upon by the hardware manufacturers .
in july last year , sony won a court case to ban the selling of mod chips for its playstation 2 in the uk .

with the 360 , microsoft is aiming to make it as hard as possible to hack .
" we 've taken security to the hardware level and built it in from the ground up , " said chris satchell from the xbox advanced technology group .
" one of the reasons we went with custom hardware design for all our silicon is that it allows us to build security at the silicon level , " he told the bbc news website .
" there are going to be levels of security in this box that the hacker community has never seen before . "
part of the motivation behind this is to prevent people from using the 360 to watch pirated films or tv shows .
but mr satchell admitted no system was fool-proof and that , with enough time and dedication , the security on the xbox 360 would be broken .
" there 're some really bright people in the world with some really expensive hardware , " he said .

the beatles signed with emi in 1962 on the wall outside tony wadsworth 's office at emi records , near hammersmith in london , hangs a cluster of framed prints of early beatles ' album covers , each signed by the fab four .
it is a clear reminder that the history of emi records is inextricably tied to the history of british popular music .
the beatles , rolling stones , pink floyd , david bowie , queen , kate bush and peter gabriel are all signed to emi .
more recently radiohead , coldplay , robbie williams , the magic numbers and kt tunstall have been added to the roster .
" it is inspiring for people here to know they are working for the company which signed the beatles , " says mr wadsworth .
he should know , having spent 22 years at emi , working with its various labels , including parlophone , overseeing the introduction of cds in 1984 and signing bands such as radiohead and coldplay .
pedigree of artists " the fact that emi is the only british owned-major record company is important but not as important as the pedigree of artists we have to look back on . "
we want creative , self starters , who have a point of difference and are going to be around for a long , long time tony wadsworth he says emi 's principles when it comes to signing artists is relatively unchanged in 20 years .
" we want creative , self starters , who have a point of difference and are going to be around for a long , long time . "
mr wadsworth cites ed harcourt and beverly knight as two artists who are backed because of the music they make and not the money they generate .
driving the point home , he adds : " for the first two albums blur were on a downward sales curve .
modern life is rubbish sold 20-odd thousand .
it was quite desperate .
" an accountant looking at the books would probably say it is the time to get out .
we decided to stick our neck out as we believed in what they were doing . "
the success of a band like coldplay allows an ed harcourt to continue working .
" what this business is is portfolio management .
the majority of artists on the live roster lose money , " he says .
' relationship stronger ' mr wadsworth says : " the relationship that exists between artists and record companies is a lot stronger and closer than the public understands .
" investment in an artist means they have time to develop their craft and their art and if they have to work full time in a bank to pay the rent they wo n't have too much time to play their music . "
emi 's two biggest recent signings have been radiohead and coldplay - both british bands who have had success in the uk and the us .
radiohead 's thom yorke has taken the band to conquer the us but mr wadsworth said they had no idea when they signed the two bands that they would become global conquerors .
" when radiohead were signed we felt they wrote great songs , doing something different .
you do n't really know where it is going to lead .
' step change ' " the step change that band made from pablo honey , their first album , to ok computer was massive .
you hope that bands are going to move with that sort of progress .
but you ca n't rely on that .
" with coldplay we always believed in them totally but the speed and the ubiquity of their success has been a pleasant surprise .
" when you think that not too long ago they were waiting for degree results , now they are hollywood royalty . "
in recent years music bosses have been criticised for not changing quickly enough .
artificially inflating cd prices , promoting packaged pop , stifling innovation and dragging its heels over downloading are just a few of the accusations most often levelled .
" music is something people feel very personal about .
the very idea that it 's also a commercial product to somebody else probably jars with the personal relationship you have with that music , " says mr wadsworth .
but he feels emi is innocent of the charges .
' embraced digital ' coldplay forced a wobble in emi shares when they said their album was delayed " the industry does not make unreasonable profits .
it has got a return on sale which is about average for any industry of this kind , " he says , arguing that cds have not risen in price like other similar consumer goods .

going shopping in zimbabwe these days is an odd experience .
drivers can beat fuel queues with foreign currency - or a cart for one thing , you do n't simply plan to go to the supermarket on tuesday after work .
more likely , you find yourself rushing there when a rumour goes around the neighbourhood that one shop is selling bread that morning .
you get there , and if you 're lucky there 's bread , but there 's no cooking oil , flour or soap ; the shelves will , however , be stacked with things like wine , chocolate and electrical appliances .
buying any of these luxuries will require wads of $ 20,000 notes - now the highest denomination , but worth less than us $ 0.50 on the black market .
inflation runs at more than 250 % per year .
outside the shop you might spot a $ 500 note lying on the ground - no-one considers it worth the effort to bend down to pick it up .
wine but no bread zimbabwe has long had policies of fixing the prices of basic commodities so that the poorest may not go hungry , but in the context of inflation , general shortages and partial deregulation , the policy is backfiring : price-controlled goods mean little or no profit for shopkeepers .
fuel shortages mean bulawayo 's streets have little traffic these days " any trader will try to put on the shelves anything that is not controlled , " says martin rupiya , senior researcher in peace and security at the institute for security studies in south africa 's capital , pretoria .
until 1998 , there was a heavy tax on imported items - the imf insisted this tax be scrapped , providing a further incentive for shopkeepers to favour luxuries over essentials .
is there hope for the common man in zimbabwe ?
omorodion osula , usa inside zimbabwe : ask justin your questions while traders who have applied to the reserve bank for foreign currency are legally obliged to show that part of their allowance has been spent on basics , they tend to keep this to a minimum .
zimbabweans complain of bakeries that sell bread at the regulated price , but bake their loaves less than the standard weight .
band-aid for years now , pundits have been predicting the imminent collapse of zimbabwe 's economy , amid hyperinflation and foreign exchange shortages .
will it ever happen ?
has it already happened ?
what does " collapse " mean anyhow ?
zimbabwe , as a case study , keeps on surprising us martin rupiya q & a : zimbabwe and imf " the context of collapse may be different in terms of what we are looking for , " mr rupiya says .
" at street level things have just about stopped functioning - it 's at a different level for the international community . "
patrick bond from the centre for civil society at south africa 's university of kwazulu-natal also points to a difference between the big and the small picture : " at the macro level , the state seems capable of periodically bailing out the economy ... and by assessing where forex is for emergency purchases and making those available to its preferred importers .
so i would anticipate this continuing though the costs - hyperinflation and the culture of the black market - are severe .
" on the micro side , the key question is whether the complicated functioning of a siege economy with very divergent market power can continue .
" but i think at a certain point , it 's very hard to keep a patient alive when there 's more band-aid than skin .
when that critical point comes is impossible to say . "
dollarisation it 's easy to find the petrol stations in zimbabwe - just look for the queue of cars that may be 100 vehicles long .
and if you do see a petrol station with no queue , it 's probably one of the garages that the government recently designated as taking foreign currency only .
food subsidies mean trading in basic goods is unprofitable this response to the fuel crisis drew a furious response from zimbabwe 's privately-owned press , which felt that government 's assurance that it would ask no questions about the source of the foreign currency legitimised those who have been stashing foreign exchange illegally for years .
patrick bond describes the measure as " the first step towards a more general ' dollarisation ' .
it 's important but i think the state will limit dollarisation for the moment , because it still has this awesome power to grab forex everywhere it can sniff it out . "
the government surprised most observers when it " sniffed out " $ 120m to pay back part of its imf debt .
mr rupiya says there is a need to examine whether the economy is capable of generating foreign exchange : " if it 's not , then dollarisation will start to undermine the economy . "
so where are the dollars coming from these days ?
a mismanaged land reform programme is widely blamed for the shrinking of the commercial agriculture sector , which cost zimbabwe dearly in terms of foreign exchange , at the same time as drought exacerbated the need to import basic foodstuffs .
but south african and australian investors remain committed to the mining sector , along with the unknown deals that may have resulted from president robert mugabe 's recent overtures towards china - even electrical and fuel shortages are likely to take their toll on the mines ' output .
imf ruling so what will happen once the imf makes its decision ?
mr rupiya believes that if the imf votes not to expel zimbabwe - as seems likely - harare will respond by implementing some of the structural changes the fund has called for , including the lifting of restrictions on trade and the cancellation of subsidies .
zimbabweans have to queue for everyday goods - if in stock this is a measure that can hurt the poorest hardest - though in zimbabwe 's case it may be somewhat mitigated by the fact that the subsidised basics are barely available anyway .
another recommendation would be to cut public spending , yet the recent decision to introduce the senate - an upper house of parliament accommodating 66 new members - suggests the government is not about to tighten its belt .
" zimbabwe , as a case study , keeps on surprising us , " mr rupiya says .
in any case , mr bond argues , it will make no difference at all whether or not zimbabwe is expelled from the imf : " they have n't been repaying loans at the required rate since 1999 , and they owe the world bank and african development bank even more , with no prospect of paying .
" even if they were fully repaid , their policies prevent any further lending .
so the $ 120m repayment - if really true - was mere vanity , it seems . "
according to mr bond , only fundamental political change will revive zimbabwe 's economic fortunes : " the most important aspects of economic revival are linked to a dramatic change required in social confidence and in the class character of the elite , who are generally parasitical and corrupt . "

over the next 10 days the event will screen 335 films from 52 countries , including 109 world premieres .

by wednesday , the 300,000 copies were being manufactured and by friday they were in record stores throughout the uk .
this time around things will be a little more slick .
after recording , the songs will be sent to a mixing studio in london .
within hours the entire album will be available for anyone in the world to download .
not bad for 24 hours ' work .

seven research groups will benefit from the cancer research uk cash and 11 new research posts will be created .
a spokesman said the award , which is the largest sum the university has received for cancer research , reflected the high calibre of its cancer work .
the research will take place over the next three to five years .
three of the research grants , totalling more than £ 8m , have been awarded to the cancer research uk molecular pharmacology unit at the university of dundee .
anti-cancer drugs the remaining four research grants have been awarded to scientists based in the school of life sciences at the university of dundee .
scientists will look at how drugs are processed by the body to help them identify more tailored anti-cancer drugs with fewer side-effects .
they will also attempt to unravel the role of enzymes in a vital pathway which can be faulty in cancer cases .
and they will look at the controls in place when cells multiply to stop them corrupting , triggering cancer .
different people respond completely differently to different drugs dr colin henderson cancer specialist sir alan langlands , dundee university 's principal , said they were grateful to cancer research uk for its support .
" awards on this scale are a clear endorsement of the calibre of the cancer research being carried out at the university of dundee , " he said .
" we are pleased that our researchers are able to contribute to the understanding , treatment and prevention of cancer . "
dr colin henderson , a cancer specialist at the university , told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that the funds would help research into how everyday chemicals interact with the body .
he said : " if we can understand more about the defence systems that we have in our bodies , we can then try to understand how we can deliver anti-cancer treatments more effectively . "
he added : " this is leading to the idea of personalised medicine , which is another central part of our research - the idea that different people respond completely differently to different drugs and if we can understand the basis for that we can tailor different drugs for different people . "

different people respond completely differently to different drugs dr colin henderson cancer specialist sir alan langlands , dundee university 's principal , said they were grateful to cancer research uk for its support .
" awards on this scale are a clear endorsement of the calibre of the cancer research being carried out at the university of dundee , " he said .

dr colin henderson , a cancer specialist at the university , told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that the funds would help research into how everyday chemicals interact with the body .
he said : " if we can understand more about the defence systems that we have in our bodies , we can then try to understand how we can deliver anti-cancer treatments more effectively . "
he added : " this is leading to the idea of personalised medicine , which is another central part of our research - the idea that different people respond completely differently to different drugs and if we can understand the basis for that we can tailor different drugs for different people . "

chorley fm has received a five-year licence to broadcast round the clock to the local community .
" the radio station that inspired peter kay 's imagination is now a reality , and will be coming soon to chorley people " , says station boss , christian moss .
phoenix nights co-star dave spikey is a station patron .
cheesy station the fictional chorley fm developed a life of its own in kay 's shows , that peter kay thing and phoenix nights .
the comic sells t-shirts and car stickers bearing the station 's name .
a station spokeswoman said peter kay was unaware the real station existed .

analysis by evan davis bbc economics editor finance ministers are important but the people with real power are the statisticians .
it must feel that way to gordon brown at least because when our chancellor worked up his big idea of the international finance facility it was n't the prime minister he needed to persuade , nor the president of the us , nor the pope .
it was the official european statisticians residing in an agency , called eurostat , in luxembourg .
mr brown needed their blessing and he eventually got it on 2 august .
with the thumbs up from eurostat , the pilot version of the iff was ready for its launch , which it gets on friday .
off books so , why were the statisticians so important ?
it is all because the iff is really a clever way of borrowing money .
we borrow it to give out as development aid to poorer countries .
we pay it back in future out of our aid budgets then . "
there are a few curmudgeonly voices who point out some unhelpful truths " now , no statistician can stop us borrowing money and giving it away : we have always been free to do that .
what was crucial to the idea of the iff though was that the borrowing did not show up in the books .
it is eurostat which decides what counts as borrowing and it decided that the mini-pilot scheme being launched today does not count as government borrowing .
it will count as international organisation borrowing , albeit to be paid back by governments .
relief ?
" phew " , mr brown must have said when the news came in .
he has got more than enough borrowing on the books as it is and there would be no international finance facility at all if the borrowing had had to be added to the rest .
so , now the statisticians have given the nod , today 's launch of the mini iff should see a modest $ 4bn over 10 years going towards the global vaccine fund .
that will only cost the british taxpayer £ 70m a year but if it saves 10 million lives , who 's complaining ?
well , there are one or two curmudgeonly voices who point out some unhelpful truths .
when we come to pay back this money in a few years , there will be less aid for the world 's poor then .
we are bringing aid forward - no one 's going to get it twice .
trade fears and then some curmudgeons also say : look at the countries signing up to this scheme alongside britain - france , italy and spain ?
are n't these the very same countries who have been most vociferous in stopping cheap textile imports from china ?
is it really sensible to hand out aid while obstructing trade from countries when they actually find something to sell us ?
so in a way it actually gets to the heart of our whole relationship with the developing world .
this is meant to be the year of development , the year of africa , but even this year it seems easier to make small cash handouts than big concessions .
the international finance facility for immunisation will help people but it involves little political sacrifice .
it seems that when it comes to helping the poor it is less the big visionaries who are getting their way , it is more the book-keepers who determine what gets done .

analysis by evan davis bbc economics editor polio vaccines are among the life-saving measures planned finance ministers are important but the people with real power are the statisticians .
it must feel that way to gordon brown at least because when our chancellor worked up his big idea of the international finance facility it was n't the prime minister he needed to persuade , nor the president of the us , nor the pope .
it was the official european statisticians residing in an agency , called eurostat , in luxembourg .
mr brown needed their blessing and he eventually got it on 2 august .
with the thumbs up from eurostat , the pilot version of the iff was ready for its launch , which it gets on friday .
off books so , why were the statisticians so important ?
it is all because the iff is really a clever way of borrowing money .
we borrow it to give out as development aid to poorer countries .
we pay it back in future out of our aid budgets then .
there are a few curmudgeonly voices who point out some unhelpful truths now , no statistician can stop us borrowing money and giving it away : we have always been free to do that .
what was crucial to the idea of the iff though was that the borrowing did not show up in the books .
it is eurostat which decides what counts as borrowing and it decided that the mini-pilot scheme being launched today does not count as government borrowing .
it will count as international organisation borrowing , albeit to be paid back by governments .
relief ?
" phew " , mr brown must have said when the news came in .
he has got more than enough borrowing on the books as it is and there would be no international finance facility at all if the borrowing had had to be added to the rest .
so , now the statisticians have given the nod , today 's launch of the mini iff should see a modest $ 4bn over 10 years going towards the global vaccine fund .
