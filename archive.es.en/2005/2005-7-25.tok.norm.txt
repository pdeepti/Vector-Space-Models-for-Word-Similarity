governors are against creating a " german fbi . " " it 's urgent that the federal criminal office can also act preventatively against terorristic threats , " schily told the german mass daily bild .
until now , the bka , responsible for investigating threats to germany - locally or abroad - passed on tips it had gathered on possible threats and suspects to the state investigative agencies .
the agencies would then act on them and took any sort of preventative measures - like surveillance or arrests - needed . critics , like schily , say the extra step puts up an unnecessary obstacle that could delay quick action on a terror threat . no need for " german fbi " günther beckstein , the conservative interior minister of bavaria and normally a schily ally , disagreed .
" the demand for a german fbi is not one of ours , " beckstein said following the attacks .
security work must happen locally , and " ca n't be organized centrally from berlin . " there are an estimated 300 islamic fundamentalists currently under observation by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution , said schily .
major trials involving planned terrorist attacks or activities are taking place in munich , hamburg and düsseldorf , where members of alleged al qaeda splinter group al-tawhid are on trial for planning attacks on us and israeli targets in germany . though schily was careful to point out that the vast majority of the country 's more than three million muslims was peaceful , fundamentalists continue to pose a major threat to the country . still , he said he did n't " think much of fatalistic predictions that it was only a matter of time before something like what happened in london or madrid happened in germany . "
muslim community needs to cooperate he urged the muslim community to be more active in combating fundamental tendencies among its youth .
" it 's imperative that the muslim community works together with the security services to fight fundamentalism and terrorism , " said schily . though the interior minister continues to push for more competencies , the chances he will get his way are limited by the german constitution , which clearly divides up responsibilities between the federal government and germany 's 16 states .
a reform of germany 's federal structure , pushed by his social democratic party is currently on ice because of new elections .
the same fate will meet his push for more competency for federal investigators . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over security response while 51 percent of germans express concern at the prospect of their country becoming a target for terrorists , politicians are bickering over what action to take to secure the country from attack .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election issues : what 's at stake a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2005 last chance talks for g4 un hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after cosy but ultimately failed talks in new york , the g4 head to london diplomats from germany , india , japan , brazil and the african union meet in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expanding the un security council by september . it is being billed as a " make-or-break " meeting for the four united nations security council hopefuls . foreign ministers from germany , india , japan and brazil meet with their african union counterparts in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expansion of the un security council by september . while the common goal is a seat at the powerful table alongside the united states , france , britain , russia and china , there is no certainty that the g4 hopefuls will be successful in their negotiations as last week 's failure in new york to achieve a joint position showed .
the onus is now on the african union -lrb- au -rrb- to help make a breakthrough . the g4 aspirants are proposing an expansion of the 15-member security council to 25 , including six new permanent seats and have been working towards a vote in the general assembly this month and a decision before a summit of world leaders in september .
but they have come up hard against opposition form the us and china . african union ministers hold the key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura , united nations general assembly president jean ping , india 's foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- not visible -rrb- , and brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim .
germany , india , japan and brazil all know that their bids can not succeed without african support .
" we have exhausted our discussion .
it is now up to african ministers to take a decision , " kenzo oshima , japan 's un ambassador , wearily told reporters on monday . but while au backing would be a major boost in getting the two-thirds support in the 191-member general assembly needed to push through any reforms - the au has 53 members - it is not a guarantee for success . au has own agenda and inner conflict the au has its own demands which do not fit in with the g4 's current plans .
it wants the security council to be expanded to 26 , and says the new permanent seats should have veto rights - a position the g4 already abandoned for lack of support . as well as these conflicting demands , some un diplomats suggest the au is itself ready to split over its own position due to internal arguments over tactics . all in all , the job of ensuring support for a g4 bid from an allegedly fractious and divided au at odds with the ideas of germany , india , japan and brazil is a difficult one . german diplomats have admitted efforts to find a common position could drag on beyond the self-imposed september deadline .
they have warned that those in opposition to security council reform were using " all the spoiling tactics available to them . " aggressive german campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder it could be the last throw of the dice for germany , whose incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder has targeted security council membership as imperative . the germans have waged an aggressive campaign involving shuttle diplomacy and global lobbying but have found themselves accused of promising increased aid to poor african , asian and latin american countries in exchange for support . kazakh ambassador to the un yerzham kazykhanov has claimed that a german envoy asked for support for permanent council membership and proposed greater investment in tapping kazakhstan 's 13.8 billion barrels of oil reserves in return . g4 powers accused of financial incentives and the germans are n't alone .
the prestige and power that comes with a council seat has apparently driven other members of the g4 to offer incentives .
japan invited afghanistan 's foreign minister to tokyo in may to hear its case for a permanent seat and the war-damaged nation was offered an increase in aid , according to un ambassador ravan farhadi . the campaign has led other envoys at the united nations to voice concerns .
lobbying by the g4 would be " judged as unethical or worse " if it occurred in a national election , pakistani ambassador munir akram said in a july 11 speech to the un general assembly . germany , japan deny any wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoriko kawaguchi , left , foreign minister of japan , and joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany .
japanese and german envoys deny any explicit offers to trade aid for votes .
dirk rotenberg , spokesman for the german mission , told bloomberg that investment in kazakhstan or other developing nations has " nothing to do " with the outcome of the g4 proposal .
yoshifumo okamura , special un envoy for japan , added in the same article that there was no direct connection between japanese aid to afghanistan and security council membership . with the stakes so evidently high for those involved in the talks in london on monday , nothing less than successful negotiations will do . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 , au still at a stalemate over un reforms brazil , germany , india and japan reached no compromise with the african union -lrb- au -rrb- sunday , but agreed to press on with negotiations to overcome remaining differences over the proposed reforms of the un security council .
-lrb- july 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany on un diplomatic offensive after rejection by the us of a draft resolution by germany and three other countries for permanent un security council seats , berlin and its allies are going on the offensive to drum up support for their plan .
-lrb- july 14 , 2005 -rrb- un reform sparks heavy debate tensions ran high during the first day of debates at the united nations on security council enlargement .
diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .

the onus is now on the african union -lrb- au -rrb- to help make a breakthrough . the g4 aspirants are proposing an expansion of the 15-member security council to 25 , including six new permanent seats and have been working towards a vote in the general assembly this month and a decision before a summit of world leaders in september .

or at least very little , seeing as there are some parallels : great britain and egypt are both close allies of the united states , and both tony blair and hosni mubarak are presented by al qaeda as stooges of george w. bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharm el-sheikh it is perceived discrimination that leads to violence and terror being directed against the state .
not against its official representatives - for that the terrorists are too cowardly - but rather against innocent people such as underground passengers in london and hotel staff and souvenir hawkers in egypt . the victims are randomly and blindly picked , possibly belonging to the same population group as the perpetrators .
terrorists do n't care about such things .
innocent victims are the " collateral damage " of their battle against the dark forces of the us and its allies - to use the same cynical term that the us itself first used in its fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes was shot dead by british police such " collateral damage " by the british includes the young brazilian man who was practically executed by the british police with five bullets pumped into his head .
why ?
because he came out from the wrong building , wore a coat in summer , looked southern or " oriental " and then fled from the cops .
scotland yard 's statement that it deeply regrets the tragic mistake sounds hollow because it adds that targeted killings remains permissible in special cases . britain treading on dangerous ground " targeted killing " could also be " murder in broad daylight . "
the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .
her majesty 's agents still , however , have carte blanche to first shoot and ask questions later . that makes britain - a recognized democracy - move dangerously close to countries and regimes in the middle east recognized for not being democratic .
egypt , for example , which serves the us as a willing helper in the interrogation of disagreeable suspects in the fight against terror .
washington may have guantanamo , but in egypt torture can take place more nonchalantly . however , the egyptian authorities have n't killed any suspects so far .
they have only arrested dozens of possible witnesses in order to pick up the trail of the perpetrators - perpetrators , who consciously aimed to strike hosni mubarak 's regime at its most sensitive spot : the tourism industry , which brings in lucrative foreign currency . the poor hit the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearful reunions as tourists come home from egypt much like in the aftermath of big attacks in the past , tourists will lose their appetite to spend their holidays in the land of the pharaohs . it 's an understandable sentiment but still a tragic mistake .
after all , avoiding a certain country ca n't protect one from terrorism .
and would people think of canceling their vacations to england ? in the case of egypt , it 's the poor who are worst hit - they are among the victims and they are the ones who will in future sit in front of empty hotels and have nothing to eat .
it 's the same scenario as tsunami-affected regions experienced earlier this year . it might sound macabre , but one is as helpless against terrorism as one was against the seaquake .

or at least very little , seeing as there are some parallels : great britain and egypt are both close allies of the united states , and both tony blair and hosni mubarak are presented by al qaeda as stooges of george w. bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharm el-sheikh it is perceived discrimination that leads to violence and terror being directed against the state .
not against its official representatives - for that the terrorists are too cowardly - but rather against innocent people such as underground passengers in london and hotel staff and souvenir hawkers in egypt . the victims are randomly and blindly picked , possibly belonging to the same population group as the perpetrators .
terrorists do n't care about such things .
innocent victims are the " collateral damage " of their battle against the dark forces of the us and its allies - to use the same cynical term that the us itself first used in its fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes was shot dead by british police such " collateral damage " by the british includes the young brazilian man who was practically executed by the british police with five bullets pumped into his head .
why ?
because he came out from the wrong building , wore a coat in summer , looked southern or " oriental " and then fled from the cops .
scotland yard 's statement that it deeply regrets the tragic mistake sounds hollow because it adds that targeted killings remains permissible in special cases . britain treading on dangerous ground " targeted killing " could also be " murder in broad daylight . "
the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .
her majesty 's agents still , however , have carte blanche to first shoot and ask questions later . that makes britain - a recognized democracy - move dangerously close to countries and regimes in the middle east recognized for not being democratic .
egypt , for example , which serves the us as a willing helper in the interrogation of disagreeable suspects in the fight against terror .
washington may have guantanamo , but in egypt torture can take place more nonchalantly . however , the egyptian authorities have n't killed any suspects so far .
they have only arrested dozens of possible witnesses in order to pick up the trail of the perpetrators - perpetrators , who consciously aimed to strike hosni mubarak 's regime at its most sensitive spot : the tourism industry , which brings in lucrative foreign currency . the poor hit the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearful reunions as tourists come home from egypt much like in the aftermath of big attacks in the past , tourists will lose their appetite to spend their holidays in the land of the pharaohs . it 's an understandable sentiment but still a tragic mistake .
after all , avoiding a certain country ca n't protect one from terrorism .
and would people think of canceling their vacations to england ? in the case of egypt , it 's the poor who are worst hit - they are among the victims and they are the ones who will in future sit in front of empty hotels and have nothing to eat .
it 's the same scenario as tsunami-affected regions experienced earlier this year . it might sound macabre , but one is as helpless against terrorism as one was against the seaquake .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .
she underlined that this time the emphasis would on putting forward the right arguments .
" once you discuss with the people then you quickly realize that they do n't really know what to expect from the cdu . " small parties not exactly ecstatic the big parties may be raring to fight it out at the polls , but it is n't necessarily the same with the smaller ones .
in particular , the green party did n't really want new elections - quite apart from the fact that they were n't even asked about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer enveloped in green at a party conference and to add to the woes of the green party , the cdu is now hitting the campaign trail with a woman at the forefront while the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , their likely coalition partner , have a homosexual man as a leader .
the greens ' macho man joschka fischer is once again expected to lead the party to increase its share of the vote .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .
she underlined that this time the emphasis would on putting forward the right arguments .
" once you discuss with the people then you quickly realize that they do n't really know what to expect from the cdu . " small parties not exactly ecstatic the big parties may be raring to fight it out at the polls , but it is n't necessarily the same with the smaller ones .
in particular , the green party did n't really want new elections - quite apart from the fact that they were n't even asked about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer enveloped in green at a party conference and to add to the woes of the green party , the cdu is now hitting the campaign trail with a woman at the forefront while the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , their likely coalition partner , have a homosexual man as a leader .
the greens ' macho man joschka fischer is once again expected to lead the party to increase its share of the vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2005 eleven friends and their love of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two friends behind " 11 friends " for the past five years , a scrappy fan-focused soccer magazine has been winning hearts in germany .
a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .

" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .
" we are doing this magazine for people like us , " he said .
" people who are aware of their position as a fan , who reflect on it and ask why they 're fans .

there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

governors are against creating a " german fbi . " " it 's urgent that the federal criminal office can also act preventatively against terorristic threats , " schily told the german mass daily bild .
until now , the bka , responsible for investigating threats to germany - locally or abroad - passed on tips it had gathered on possible threats and suspects to the state investigative agencies .
the agencies would then act on them and took any sort of preventative measures - like surveillance or arrests - needed . critics , like schily , say the extra step puts up an unnecessary obstacle that could delay quick action on a terror threat . no need for " german fbi " günther beckstein , the conservative interior minister of bavaria and normally a schily ally , disagreed .
" the demand for a german fbi is not one of ours , " beckstein said following the attacks .
security work must happen locally , and " ca n't be organized centrally from berlin . " there are an estimated 300 islamic fundamentalists currently under observation by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution , said schily .
major trials involving planned terrorist attacks or activities are taking place in munich , hamburg and düsseldorf , where members of alleged al qaeda splinter group al-tawhid are on trial for planning attacks on us and israeli targets in germany . though schily was careful to point out that the vast majority of the country 's more than three million muslims was peaceful , fundamentalists continue to pose a major threat to the country . still , he said he did n't " think much of fatalistic predictions that it was only a matter of time before something like what happened in london or madrid happened in germany . "
muslim community needs to cooperate he urged the muslim community to be more active in combating fundamental tendencies among its youth .
" it 's imperative that the muslim community works together with the security services to fight fundamentalism and terrorism , " said schily . though the interior minister continues to push for more competencies , the chances he will get his way are limited by the german constitution , which clearly divides up responsibilities between the federal government and germany 's 16 states .
a reform of germany 's federal structure , pushed by his social democratic party is currently on ice because of new elections .
the same fate will meet his push for more competency for federal investigators . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over security response while 51 percent of germans express concern at the prospect of their country becoming a target for terrorists , politicians are bickering over what action to take to secure the country from attack .

the dual system , which requires both workers and their employers to pay a portion of the insurance coverage , would be kept under the cdu / csu , but the rate due by the employer would remain constant .

children will not be required to pay insurance – instead it will be paid for out of tax revenues .

for nursing care coverage , the cdu and csu intend on introducing a capital-based plan during their first legislative period . the greens the greens platform calls for a citizens ' health insurance , in which everyone pays a fee based on income .
services and coverage provided by the insurance plans will be based on cost developments in the health care branch .
all coverage for the handicapped should be written in law so that the financial support for those patients does not dependent on the financial situation of the federal budget . fdp the business-friendly fdp wants to do away with the statutory health and nursing care insurance plans .
each citizen should insure himself privately and determine for himself which plan is best suited for the individual situation .
a minimum insurance coverage would be required by law , but anything above or beyond is a private choice .
health and nursing care coverage for children and the otherwise disenfranchised should be covered by tax revenues . the left party the party of oscar lafontaine and gregor gysi calls for a " solidarity-based citizens ' insurance , " which would include all professions and income levels in a statutory health and nursing care plan . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

governors are against creating a " german fbi . " " it 's urgent that the federal criminal office can also act preventatively against terorristic threats , " schily told the german mass daily bild .
until now , the bka , responsible for investigating threats to germany - locally or abroad - passed on tips it had gathered on possible threats and suspects to the state investigative agencies .
the agencies would then act on them and took any sort of preventative measures - like surveillance or arrests - needed . critics , like schily , say the extra step puts up an unnecessary obstacle that could delay quick action on a terror threat . no need for " german fbi " günther beckstein , the conservative interior minister of bavaria and normally a schily ally , disagreed .
" the demand for a german fbi is not one of ours , " beckstein said following the attacks .
security work must happen locally , and " ca n't be organized centrally from berlin . " there are an estimated 300 islamic fundamentalists currently under observation by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution , said schily .
major trials involving planned terrorist attacks or activities are taking place in munich , hamburg and düsseldorf , where members of alleged al qaeda splinter group al-tawhid are on trial for planning attacks on us and israeli targets in germany . though schily was careful to point out that the vast majority of the country 's more than three million muslims was peaceful , fundamentalists continue to pose a major threat to the country . still , he said he did n't " think much of fatalistic predictions that it was only a matter of time before something like what happened in london or madrid happened in germany . "
muslim community needs to cooperate he urged the muslim community to be more active in combating fundamental tendencies among its youth .
" it 's imperative that the muslim community works together with the security services to fight fundamentalism and terrorism , " said schily . though the interior minister continues to push for more competencies , the chances he will get his way are limited by the german constitution , which clearly divides up responsibilities between the federal government and germany 's 16 states .
a reform of germany 's federal structure , pushed by his social democratic party is currently on ice because of new elections .
the same fate will meet his push for more competency for federal investigators . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over security response while 51 percent of germans express concern at the prospect of their country becoming a target for terrorists , politicians are bickering over what action to take to secure the country from attack .

it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .
she underlined that this time the emphasis would on putting forward the right arguments .
" once you discuss with the people then you quickly realize that they do n't really know what to expect from the cdu . " small parties not exactly ecstatic the big parties may be raring to fight it out at the polls , but it is n't necessarily the same with the smaller ones .
in particular , the green party did n't really want new elections - quite apart from the fact that they were n't even asked about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer enveloped in green at a party conference and to add to the woes of the green party , the cdu is now hitting the campaign trail with a woman at the forefront while the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , their likely coalition partner , have a homosexual man as a leader .

the onus is now on the african union -lrb- au -rrb- to help make a breakthrough . the g4 aspirants are proposing an expansion of the 15-member security council to 25 , including six new permanent seats and have been working towards a vote in the general assembly this month and a decision before a summit of world leaders in september .
but they have come up hard against opposition form the us and china . african union ministers hold the key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura , united nations general assembly president jean ping , india 's foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- not visible -rrb- , and brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim .
germany , india , japan and brazil all know that their bids can not succeed without african support .
" we have exhausted our discussion .
it is now up to african ministers to take a decision , " kenzo oshima , japan 's un ambassador , wearily told reporters on monday . but while au backing would be a major boost in getting the two-thirds support in the 191-member general assembly needed to push through any reforms - the au has 53 members - it is not a guarantee for success . au has own agenda and inner conflict the au has its own demands which do not fit in with the g4 's current plans .
it wants the security council to be expanded to 26 , and says the new permanent seats should have veto rights - a position the g4 already abandoned for lack of support . as well as these conflicting demands , some un diplomats suggest the au is itself ready to split over its own position due to internal arguments over tactics . all in all , the job of ensuring support for a g4 bid from an allegedly fractious and divided au at odds with the ideas of germany , india , japan and brazil is a difficult one . german diplomats have admitted efforts to find a common position could drag on beyond the self-imposed september deadline .

the prestige and power that comes with a council seat has apparently driven other members of the g4 to offer incentives .
japan invited afghanistan 's foreign minister to tokyo in may to hear its case for a permanent seat and the war-damaged nation was offered an increase in aid , according to un ambassador ravan farhadi . the campaign has led other envoys at the united nations to voice concerns .
lobbying by the g4 would be " judged as unethical or worse " if it occurred in a national election , pakistani ambassador munir akram said in a july 11 speech to the un general assembly . germany , japan deny any wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoriko kawaguchi , left , foreign minister of japan , and joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany .
japanese and german envoys deny any explicit offers to trade aid for votes .
dirk rotenberg , spokesman for the german mission , told bloomberg that investment in kazakhstan or other developing nations has " nothing to do " with the outcome of the g4 proposal .
yoshifumo okamura , special un envoy for japan , added in the same article that there was no direct connection between japanese aid to afghanistan and security council membership . with the stakes so evidently high for those involved in the talks in london on monday , nothing less than successful negotiations will do . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 , au still at a stalemate over un reforms brazil , germany , india and japan reached no compromise with the african union -lrb- au -rrb- sunday , but agreed to press on with negotiations to overcome remaining differences over the proposed reforms of the un security council .

or at least very little , seeing as there are some parallels : great britain and egypt are both close allies of the united states , and both tony blair and hosni mubarak are presented by al qaeda as stooges of george w. bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharm el-sheikh it is perceived discrimination that leads to violence and terror being directed against the state .
not against its official representatives - for that the terrorists are too cowardly - but rather against innocent people such as underground passengers in london and hotel staff and souvenir hawkers in egypt . the victims are randomly and blindly picked , possibly belonging to the same population group as the perpetrators .
terrorists do n't care about such things .
innocent victims are the " collateral damage " of their battle against the dark forces of the us and its allies - to use the same cynical term that the us itself first used in its fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes was shot dead by british police such " collateral damage " by the british includes the young brazilian man who was practically executed by the british police with five bullets pumped into his head .
why ?
because he came out from the wrong building , wore a coat in summer , looked southern or " oriental " and then fled from the cops .
scotland yard 's statement that it deeply regrets the tragic mistake sounds hollow because it adds that targeted killings remains permissible in special cases . britain treading on dangerous ground " targeted killing " could also be " murder in broad daylight . "
the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .
her majesty 's agents still , however , have carte blanche to first shoot and ask questions later . that makes britain - a recognized democracy - move dangerously close to countries and regimes in the middle east recognized for not being democratic .
egypt , for example , which serves the us as a willing helper in the interrogation of disagreeable suspects in the fight against terror .
washington may have guantanamo , but in egypt torture can take place more nonchalantly . however , the egyptian authorities have n't killed any suspects so far .
they have only arrested dozens of possible witnesses in order to pick up the trail of the perpetrators - perpetrators , who consciously aimed to strike hosni mubarak 's regime at its most sensitive spot : the tourism industry , which brings in lucrative foreign currency . the poor hit the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearful reunions as tourists come home from egypt much like in the aftermath of big attacks in the past , tourists will lose their appetite to spend their holidays in the land of the pharaohs . it 's an understandable sentiment but still a tragic mistake .
after all , avoiding a certain country ca n't protect one from terrorism .
and would people think of canceling their vacations to england ? in the case of egypt , it 's the poor who are worst hit - they are among the victims and they are the ones who will in future sit in front of empty hotels and have nothing to eat .
it 's the same scenario as tsunami-affected regions experienced earlier this year . it might sound macabre , but one is as helpless against terrorism as one was against the seaquake .

the situation poses serious consequences for the state 's pension plans . spd the goal is to keep retirement age at 65 .
at the moment , a good number of germans opt for an early retirement package before the age of 60 .

the cdu / csu also wants to reduce the number of years germans spend studying and at the same time raise the retirement age . greens the greens are in favor of more state backing for private pension plans .
the party also wants to see a new " generation contract " which would share the burden across the generations , but there has been no mention of details in their election platform . fdp the fdp wants to keep the retirement age at 65 .
contributions to the state retirement plan should not be higher than 19 percent of income ; and the pension should not be reduced . left party the new party wants to introduce a minimum pension of 800 euros per month .
it plans to convert the current state retirement insurance plan into a workers ' pension for all categories of jobs – unlike the current system which allows some people to opt out .

the onus is now on the african union -lrb- au -rrb- to help make a breakthrough . the g4 aspirants are proposing an expansion of the 15-member security council to 25 , including six new permanent seats and have been working towards a vote in the general assembly this month and a decision before a summit of world leaders in september .
but they have come up hard against opposition form the us and china . african union ministers hold the key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura , united nations general assembly president jean ping , india 's foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- not visible -rrb- , and brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim .
germany , india , japan and brazil all know that their bids can not succeed without african support .
" we have exhausted our discussion .
it is now up to african ministers to take a decision , " kenzo oshima , japan 's un ambassador , wearily told reporters on monday . but while au backing would be a major boost in getting the two-thirds support in the 191-member general assembly needed to push through any reforms - the au has 53 members - it is not a guarantee for success . au has own agenda and inner conflict the au has its own demands which do not fit in with the g4 's current plans .
it wants the security council to be expanded to 26 , and says the new permanent seats should have veto rights - a position the g4 already abandoned for lack of support . as well as these conflicting demands , some un diplomats suggest the au is itself ready to split over its own position due to internal arguments over tactics . all in all , the job of ensuring support for a g4 bid from an allegedly fractious and divided au at odds with the ideas of germany , india , japan and brazil is a difficult one . german diplomats have admitted efforts to find a common position could drag on beyond the self-imposed september deadline .
they have warned that those in opposition to security council reform were using " all the spoiling tactics available to them . " aggressive german campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder it could be the last throw of the dice for germany , whose incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder has targeted security council membership as imperative . the germans have waged an aggressive campaign involving shuttle diplomacy and global lobbying but have found themselves accused of promising increased aid to poor african , asian and latin american countries in exchange for support . kazakh ambassador to the un yerzham kazykhanov has claimed that a german envoy asked for support for permanent council membership and proposed greater investment in tapping kazakhstan 's 13.8 billion barrels of oil reserves in return . g4 powers accused of financial incentives and the germans are n't alone .
the prestige and power that comes with a council seat has apparently driven other members of the g4 to offer incentives .
japan invited afghanistan 's foreign minister to tokyo in may to hear its case for a permanent seat and the war-damaged nation was offered an increase in aid , according to un ambassador ravan farhadi . the campaign has led other envoys at the united nations to voice concerns .
lobbying by the g4 would be " judged as unethical or worse " if it occurred in a national election , pakistani ambassador munir akram said in a july 11 speech to the un general assembly . germany , japan deny any wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoriko kawaguchi , left , foreign minister of japan , and joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany .
japanese and german envoys deny any explicit offers to trade aid for votes .
dirk rotenberg , spokesman for the german mission , told bloomberg that investment in kazakhstan or other developing nations has " nothing to do " with the outcome of the g4 proposal .
yoshifumo okamura , special un envoy for japan , added in the same article that there was no direct connection between japanese aid to afghanistan and security council membership . with the stakes so evidently high for those involved in the talks in london on monday , nothing less than successful negotiations will do . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 , au still at a stalemate over un reforms brazil , germany , india and japan reached no compromise with the african union -lrb- au -rrb- sunday , but agreed to press on with negotiations to overcome remaining differences over the proposed reforms of the un security council .

or at least very little , seeing as there are some parallels : great britain and egypt are both close allies of the united states , and both tony blair and hosni mubarak are presented by al qaeda as stooges of george w. bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharm el-sheikh it is perceived discrimination that leads to violence and terror being directed against the state .
not against its official representatives - for that the terrorists are too cowardly - but rather against innocent people such as underground passengers in london and hotel staff and souvenir hawkers in egypt . the victims are randomly and blindly picked , possibly belonging to the same population group as the perpetrators .

scotland yard 's statement that it deeply regrets the tragic mistake sounds hollow because it adds that targeted killings remains permissible in special cases . britain treading on dangerous ground " targeted killing " could also be " murder in broad daylight . "
the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .
her majesty 's agents still , however , have carte blanche to first shoot and ask questions later . that makes britain - a recognized democracy - move dangerously close to countries and regimes in the middle east recognized for not being democratic .
egypt , for example , which serves the us as a willing helper in the interrogation of disagreeable suspects in the fight against terror .
washington may have guantanamo , but in egypt torture can take place more nonchalantly . however , the egyptian authorities have n't killed any suspects so far .

after all , avoiding a certain country ca n't protect one from terrorism .
and would people think of canceling their vacations to england ? in the case of egypt , it 's the poor who are worst hit - they are among the victims and they are the ones who will in future sit in front of empty hotels and have nothing to eat .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines at unemployment offices are growing more than five million germans are out of work : reducing unemployment is the election 's most important topic . spd the spd wants all industries to implement nationwide minimum wages on their own - otherwise the party will push for a legally mandated minimum wage .
the social democrats are opposed to weakening germany 's job-protection measures -lrb- kündigungsschutz -rrb- and is against legislation that would interfere with the ability of unions and employers to negotiate wages for their respective industries .
worker co-determination - where employees are legally entitled to be represented on company boards - is not up for discussion .
the spd plans to eliminate the differences between the new unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless -lrb- arbeitslosengeld ii -rrb- in eastern and western germany by hiking eastern germans ' monthly check to 345 euros .
older recipients of unemployment benefits will have an extra two years -lrb- 01-02-2008 not 01-02-2006 as had been planned -rrb- before their unemployment benefits are slashed to the new lower levels .
other germans without work have 12 months before their benefits are cut to the arbeitslosengeld ii level .
the spd wants to spend 250 million euros for regional efforts to find work for older germans that have difficulty finding work .
cdu / csu the union wants to cut germany 's non-wage labor costs by lowering unemployment insurance rate from 6.5 percent to 4.5 percent starting 01-01-2006 .
the conservatives also want recipients of long-term unemployment benefits to work for the first two years of a new job at wages outside of industry-wide contracts .
the wage would be up to 10 percent lower than the industry standard in order to encourage employers to hire more people .
the union also wants to repeal job-protection measures -lrb- kündigungsschutz -rrb- for firms with less than 20 employees for the first two years of employment .
non-permanent contracts could also be offered to workers that are already employed - currently such limited contracts are only possible for new employees .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
lastly , the union plans to nix so-called " ich-ags " , which were meant to make it easier for unemployed germans to become self-employed .
the greens the greens want to implement " regionally and sector-specific differentiated " minimum wages .
non-wage labor costs should also be cut in the lower income levels .
those costs would then slowly increase parallel to worker income while the financial gap could be offset by higher taxes on the private income of wealthy individuals .
like the spd , the greens oppose changes to job-protection measures , industry-wide wage negotiations , and worker co-determination .
the greens support raising unemployment benefits in line with the regional cost of living .
the party wants to look at the possibility of reducing working hours with an according reduction of wages during negotiations .
the greens want to expand the efforts of private companies in reducing long-term unemployment . fdp the fdp wants to move wage negotiation away from the currently common industry-wide tariffs and towards more individually-tailored agreements .
wage deals that deviate from the sector norm should be allowed if 75 percent of a firm 's employees back such a move .
workers councils would become mandatory only in companies with more than 20 employees and advisory boards would be reduced in size .
legal job-protection measures would go into effect only after four years on the job and only at firms with more than 50 employees .
the fdp wants to break up the federal labor agency and split its responsibilities among regional job centers . the left party the newly-formed left party wants to roll back the government 's decision to combine welfare and long-term unemployment benefits .
instead of receiving so-called hartz iv benefits , those germans long out of work would be encouraged to take part-time work and would have government aid added as net wages .
the leftist party wants a minimum monthly wage of 1,400 euros and would not change current job-protection measures .
the average work week would be legally limited to 40 hours . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study raises flag on youth unemployment the german economy has chalked up few successes over the past six months , according to a new study by the bertelsmann foundation .
the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying .
-lrb- may 6 , 2005 -rrb- one euro , one way out of unemployment ?
for those out of work , the government has introduced a new category of low-paying jobs to supplement welfare .
so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ?

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .
-lrb- july 16 , 2005 -rrb- cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .
she underlined that this time the emphasis would on putting forward the right arguments .
" once you discuss with the people then you quickly realize that they do n't really know what to expect from the cdu . " small parties not exactly ecstatic the big parties may be raring to fight it out at the polls , but it is n't necessarily the same with the smaller ones .
in particular , the green party did n't really want new elections - quite apart from the fact that they were n't even asked about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer enveloped in green at a party conference and to add to the woes of the green party , the cdu is now hitting the campaign trail with a woman at the forefront while the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , their likely coalition partner , have a homosexual man as a leader .
the greens ' macho man joschka fischer is once again expected to lead the party to increase its share of the vote .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party .

a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .
" we are doing this magazine for people like us , " he said .
" people who are aware of their position as a fan , who reflect on it and ask why they 're fans . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scoring in the chancellery in his youth , gerhard schröder was an impressive striker in local soccer leagues .
his love for the game has n't let up since .

a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .

a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .
" we are doing this magazine for people like us , " he said .

the onus is now on the african union -lrb- au -rrb- to help make a breakthrough . the g4 aspirants are proposing an expansion of the 15-member security council to 25 , including six new permanent seats and have been working towards a vote in the general assembly this month and a decision before a summit of world leaders in september .
but they have come up hard against opposition form the us and china . african union ministers hold the key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura , united nations general assembly president jean ping , india 's foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- not visible -rrb- , and brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim .
germany , india , japan and brazil all know that their bids can not succeed without african support .
" we have exhausted our discussion .
it is now up to african ministers to take a decision , " kenzo oshima , japan 's un ambassador , wearily told reporters on monday . but while au backing would be a major boost in getting the two-thirds support in the 191-member general assembly needed to push through any reforms - the au has 53 members - it is not a guarantee for success . au has own agenda and inner conflict the au has its own demands which do not fit in with the g4 's current plans .
it wants the security council to be expanded to 26 , and says the new permanent seats should have veto rights - a position the g4 already abandoned for lack of support . as well as these conflicting demands , some un diplomats suggest the au is itself ready to split over its own position due to internal arguments over tactics . all in all , the job of ensuring support for a g4 bid from an allegedly fractious and divided au at odds with the ideas of germany , india , japan and brazil is a difficult one . german diplomats have admitted efforts to find a common position could drag on beyond the self-imposed september deadline .
they have warned that those in opposition to security council reform were using " all the spoiling tactics available to them . " aggressive german campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder it could be the last throw of the dice for germany , whose incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder has targeted security council membership as imperative . the germans have waged an aggressive campaign involving shuttle diplomacy and global lobbying but have found themselves accused of promising increased aid to poor african , asian and latin american countries in exchange for support . kazakh ambassador to the un yerzham kazykhanov has claimed that a german envoy asked for support for permanent council membership and proposed greater investment in tapping kazakhstan 's 13.8 billion barrels of oil reserves in return . g4 powers accused of financial incentives and the germans are n't alone .
the prestige and power that comes with a council seat has apparently driven other members of the g4 to offer incentives .
japan invited afghanistan 's foreign minister to tokyo in may to hear its case for a permanent seat and the war-damaged nation was offered an increase in aid , according to un ambassador ravan farhadi . the campaign has led other envoys at the united nations to voice concerns .
lobbying by the g4 would be " judged as unethical or worse " if it occurred in a national election , pakistani ambassador munir akram said in a july 11 speech to the un general assembly . germany , japan deny any wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoriko kawaguchi , left , foreign minister of japan , and joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany .
japanese and german envoys deny any explicit offers to trade aid for votes .
dirk rotenberg , spokesman for the german mission , told bloomberg that investment in kazakhstan or other developing nations has " nothing to do " with the outcome of the g4 proposal .
yoshifumo okamura , special un envoy for japan , added in the same article that there was no direct connection between japanese aid to afghanistan and security council membership . with the stakes so evidently high for those involved in the talks in london on monday , nothing less than successful negotiations will do . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 , au still at a stalemate over un reforms brazil , germany , india and japan reached no compromise with the african union -lrb- au -rrb- sunday , but agreed to press on with negotiations to overcome remaining differences over the proposed reforms of the un security council .
-lrb- july 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany on un diplomatic offensive after rejection by the us of a draft resolution by germany and three other countries for permanent un security council seats , berlin and its allies are going on the offensive to drum up support for their plan .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2005 schily wants more police capabilities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily wants federal investigators to act preventatively the london attacks have sparked disagreement between state governors and interior minister schily on expanding police capabilities .
governors are against creating a " german fbi . " " it 's urgent that the federal criminal office can also act preventatively against terorristic threats , " schily told the german mass daily bild .
until now , the bka , responsible for investigating threats to germany - locally or abroad - passed on tips it had gathered on possible threats and suspects to the state investigative agencies .
the agencies would then act on them and took any sort of preventative measures - like surveillance or arrests - needed . critics , like schily , say the extra step puts up an unnecessary obstacle that could delay quick action on a terror threat . no need for " german fbi " günther beckstein , the conservative interior minister of bavaria and normally a schily ally , disagreed .
" the demand for a german fbi is not one of ours , " beckstein said following the attacks .
security work must happen locally , and " ca n't be organized centrally from berlin . " there are an estimated 300 islamic fundamentalists currently under observation by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution , said schily .

governors are against creating a " german fbi . " " it 's urgent that the federal criminal office can also act preventatively against terorristic threats , " schily told the german mass daily bild .
until now , the bka , responsible for investigating threats to germany - locally or abroad - passed on tips it had gathered on possible threats and suspects to the state investigative agencies .
the agencies would then act on them and took any sort of preventative measures - like surveillance or arrests - needed . critics , like schily , say the extra step puts up an unnecessary obstacle that could delay quick action on a terror threat . no need for " german fbi " günther beckstein , the conservative interior minister of bavaria and normally a schily ally , disagreed .
" the demand for a german fbi is not one of ours , " beckstein said following the attacks .
security work must happen locally , and " ca n't be organized centrally from berlin . " there are an estimated 300 islamic fundamentalists currently under observation by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution , said schily .

a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .
" we are doing this magazine for people like us , " he said .
" people who are aware of their position as a fan , who reflect on it and ask why they 're fans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 high-speed election campaign gets going großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel : the fight 's officially opened with federal polls now almost sure to take place , germany 's politicians face their shortest ever election campaign .
the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .
she underlined that this time the emphasis would on putting forward the right arguments .
" once you discuss with the people then you quickly realize that they do n't really know what to expect from the cdu . " small parties not exactly ecstatic the big parties may be raring to fight it out at the polls , but it is n't necessarily the same with the smaller ones .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .
she underlined that this time the emphasis would on putting forward the right arguments .
" once you discuss with the people then you quickly realize that they do n't really know what to expect from the cdu . " small parties not exactly ecstatic the big parties may be raring to fight it out at the polls , but it is n't necessarily the same with the smaller ones .
in particular , the green party did n't really want new elections - quite apart from the fact that they were n't even asked about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer enveloped in green at a party conference and to add to the woes of the green party , the cdu is now hitting the campaign trail with a woman at the forefront while the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , their likely coalition partner , have a homosexual man as a leader .
the greens ' macho man joschka fischer is once again expected to lead the party to increase its share of the vote . " that shows very clearly that without the greens , the opposition would n't be where it is today , " said advertising guru heusinger in a defense of his employer . but , convincing electoral arguments probably sound different . kerstin hilt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections prompt reserved optimism with the green light given by german president horst köhler , most politicians and people expect to vote on september 18 .

instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .

the onus is now on the african union -lrb- au -rrb- to help make a breakthrough . the g4 aspirants are proposing an expansion of the 15-member security council to 25 , including six new permanent seats and have been working towards a vote in the general assembly this month and a decision before a summit of world leaders in september .
but they have come up hard against opposition form the us and china . african union ministers hold the key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura , united nations general assembly president jean ping , india 's foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- not visible -rrb- , and brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim .
germany , india , japan and brazil all know that their bids can not succeed without african support .
" we have exhausted our discussion .
it is now up to african ministers to take a decision , " kenzo oshima , japan 's un ambassador , wearily told reporters on monday . but while au backing would be a major boost in getting the two-thirds support in the 191-member general assembly needed to push through any reforms - the au has 53 members - it is not a guarantee for success . au has own agenda and inner conflict the au has its own demands which do not fit in with the g4 's current plans .
it wants the security council to be expanded to 26 , and says the new permanent seats should have veto rights - a position the g4 already abandoned for lack of support . as well as these conflicting demands , some un diplomats suggest the au is itself ready to split over its own position due to internal arguments over tactics . all in all , the job of ensuring support for a g4 bid from an allegedly fractious and divided au at odds with the ideas of germany , india , japan and brazil is a difficult one . german diplomats have admitted efforts to find a common position could drag on beyond the self-imposed september deadline .
they have warned that those in opposition to security council reform were using " all the spoiling tactics available to them . " aggressive german campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder it could be the last throw of the dice for germany , whose incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder has targeted security council membership as imperative . the germans have waged an aggressive campaign involving shuttle diplomacy and global lobbying but have found themselves accused of promising increased aid to poor african , asian and latin american countries in exchange for support . kazakh ambassador to the un yerzham kazykhanov has claimed that a german envoy asked for support for permanent council membership and proposed greater investment in tapping kazakhstan 's 13.8 billion barrels of oil reserves in return . g4 powers accused of financial incentives and the germans are n't alone .
the prestige and power that comes with a council seat has apparently driven other members of the g4 to offer incentives .
japan invited afghanistan 's foreign minister to tokyo in may to hear its case for a permanent seat and the war-damaged nation was offered an increase in aid , according to un ambassador ravan farhadi . the campaign has led other envoys at the united nations to voice concerns .
lobbying by the g4 would be " judged as unethical or worse " if it occurred in a national election , pakistani ambassador munir akram said in a july 11 speech to the un general assembly . germany , japan deny any wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoriko kawaguchi , left , foreign minister of japan , and joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany .
japanese and german envoys deny any explicit offers to trade aid for votes .
dirk rotenberg , spokesman for the german mission , told bloomberg that investment in kazakhstan or other developing nations has " nothing to do " with the outcome of the g4 proposal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2005 eleven friends and their love of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two friends behind " 11 friends " for the past five years , a scrappy fan-focused soccer magazine has been winning hearts in germany .
a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .
" we are doing this magazine for people like us , " he said .
" people who are aware of their position as a fan , who reflect on it and ask why they 're fans . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scoring in the chancellery in his youth , gerhard schröder was an impressive striker in local soccer leagues .
his love for the game has n't let up since .
over the weekend , he opened a soccer exhibit - in the first floor of his office .

officials have faith in security measures but experts predict trouble .

or at least very little , seeing as there are some parallels : great britain and egypt are both close allies of the united states , and both tony blair and hosni mubarak are presented by al qaeda as stooges of george w. bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharm el-sheikh it is perceived discrimination that leads to violence and terror being directed against the state .
not against its official representatives - for that the terrorists are too cowardly - but rather against innocent people such as underground passengers in london and hotel staff and souvenir hawkers in egypt . the victims are randomly and blindly picked , possibly belonging to the same population group as the perpetrators .
terrorists do n't care about such things .
innocent victims are the " collateral damage " of their battle against the dark forces of the us and its allies - to use the same cynical term that the us itself first used in its fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes was shot dead by british police such " collateral damage " by the british includes the young brazilian man who was practically executed by the british police with five bullets pumped into his head .
why ?
because he came out from the wrong building , wore a coat in summer , looked southern or " oriental " and then fled from the cops .
scotland yard 's statement that it deeply regrets the tragic mistake sounds hollow because it adds that targeted killings remains permissible in special cases . britain treading on dangerous ground " targeted killing " could also be " murder in broad daylight . "
the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .
her majesty 's agents still , however , have carte blanche to first shoot and ask questions later . that makes britain - a recognized democracy - move dangerously close to countries and regimes in the middle east recognized for not being democratic .
egypt , for example , which serves the us as a willing helper in the interrogation of disagreeable suspects in the fight against terror .
washington may have guantanamo , but in egypt torture can take place more nonchalantly . however , the egyptian authorities have n't killed any suspects so far .
they have only arrested dozens of possible witnesses in order to pick up the trail of the perpetrators - perpetrators , who consciously aimed to strike hosni mubarak 's regime at its most sensitive spot : the tourism industry , which brings in lucrative foreign currency . the poor hit the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearful reunions as tourists come home from egypt much like in the aftermath of big attacks in the past , tourists will lose their appetite to spend their holidays in the land of the pharaohs . it 's an understandable sentiment but still a tragic mistake .
after all , avoiding a certain country ca n't protect one from terrorism .
and would people think of canceling their vacations to england ? in the case of egypt , it 's the poor who are worst hit - they are among the victims and they are the ones who will in future sit in front of empty hotels and have nothing to eat .
it 's the same scenario as tsunami-affected regions experienced earlier this year . it might sound macabre , but one is as helpless against terrorism as one was against the seaquake .
you ca n't prevent the quake itself and its deadly waves , but you can reduce its impact through sufficient preventive measures . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london jittery as police arrest third man londoners faced tense underground train trips to work monday fearing that at least four suicide bombers are still on the loose , despite the arrest of a third man by police who are still defending a shoot-to-kill policy .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2005 eleven friends and their love of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two friends behind " 11 friends " for the past five years , a scrappy fan-focused soccer magazine has been winning hearts in germany .
a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .
" we are doing this magazine for people like us , " he said .
" people who are aware of their position as a fan , who reflect on it and ask why they 're fans . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scoring in the chancellery in his youth , gerhard schröder was an impressive striker in local soccer leagues .
his love for the game has n't let up since .
over the weekend , he opened a soccer exhibit - in the first floor of his office .
-lrb- july 18 , 2005 -rrb- the specter of hooliganism returns german soccer hooligans have made a violent return to the international stage with just over a year to go before germany hosts the 2006 world cup .
officials have faith in security measures but experts predict trouble .
-lrb- april 7 , 2005 -rrb- world soccer made in germany germany has become famous around the world for soccer , especially because next year 's world cup takes place here .
but another reason for german soccer 's fame is a university coach training program in cologne .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2005 opinion : helpless in the face of terrorism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 64 people were killed by bombs in sharm el-sheikh the recent bombings , first in london and now in egypt , and the killing of an innocent man by british police make it clear that we 're increasingly helpless in the face of terrorism . this is the only thing that appears certain : the attacks in london and sharm el-sheikh did n't directly have anything to do with each other .
or at least very little , seeing as there are some parallels : great britain and egypt are both close allies of the united states , and both tony blair and hosni mubarak are presented by al qaeda as stooges of george w. bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharm el-sheikh it is perceived discrimination that leads to violence and terror being directed against the state .
not against its official representatives - for that the terrorists are too cowardly - but rather against innocent people such as underground passengers in london and hotel staff and souvenir hawkers in egypt . the victims are randomly and blindly picked , possibly belonging to the same population group as the perpetrators .
terrorists do n't care about such things .
innocent victims are the " collateral damage " of their battle against the dark forces of the us and its allies - to use the same cynical term that the us itself first used in its fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes was shot dead by british police such " collateral damage " by the british includes the young brazilian man who was practically executed by the british police with five bullets pumped into his head .
why ?
because he came out from the wrong building , wore a coat in summer , looked southern or " oriental " and then fled from the cops .
scotland yard 's statement that it deeply regrets the tragic mistake sounds hollow because it adds that targeted killings remains permissible in special cases . britain treading on dangerous ground " targeted killing " could also be " murder in broad daylight . "
the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .
her majesty 's agents still , however , have carte blanche to first shoot and ask questions later . that makes britain - a recognized democracy - move dangerously close to countries and regimes in the middle east recognized for not being democratic .
egypt , for example , which serves the us as a willing helper in the interrogation of disagreeable suspects in the fight against terror .
washington may have guantanamo , but in egypt torture can take place more nonchalantly . however , the egyptian authorities have n't killed any suspects so far .
they have only arrested dozens of possible witnesses in order to pick up the trail of the perpetrators - perpetrators , who consciously aimed to strike hosni mubarak 's regime at its most sensitive spot : the tourism industry , which brings in lucrative foreign currency . the poor hit the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearful reunions as tourists come home from egypt much like in the aftermath of big attacks in the past , tourists will lose their appetite to spend their holidays in the land of the pharaohs . it 's an understandable sentiment but still a tragic mistake .
after all , avoiding a certain country ca n't protect one from terrorism .
and would people think of canceling their vacations to england ? in the case of egypt , it 's the poor who are worst hit - they are among the victims and they are the ones who will in future sit in front of empty hotels and have nothing to eat .
it 's the same scenario as tsunami-affected regions experienced earlier this year . it might sound macabre , but one is as helpless against terrorism as one was against the seaquake .
you ca n't prevent the quake itself and its deadly waves , but you can reduce its impact through sufficient preventive measures . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london jittery as police arrest third man londoners faced tense underground train trips to work monday fearing that at least four suicide bombers are still on the loose , despite the arrest of a third man by police who are still defending a shoot-to-kill policy .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .

there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines at unemployment offices are growing more than five million germans are out of work : reducing unemployment is the election 's most important topic . spd the spd wants all industries to implement nationwide minimum wages on their own - otherwise the party will push for a legally mandated minimum wage .
the social democrats are opposed to weakening germany 's job-protection measures -lrb- kündigungsschutz -rrb- and is against legislation that would interfere with the ability of unions and employers to negotiate wages for their respective industries .
worker co-determination - where employees are legally entitled to be represented on company boards - is not up for discussion .
the spd plans to eliminate the differences between the new unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless -lrb- arbeitslosengeld ii -rrb- in eastern and western germany by hiking eastern germans ' monthly check to 345 euros .
older recipients of unemployment benefits will have an extra two years -lrb- 01-02-2008 not 01-02-2006 as had been planned -rrb- before their unemployment benefits are slashed to the new lower levels .
other germans without work have 12 months before their benefits are cut to the arbeitslosengeld ii level .
the spd wants to spend 250 million euros for regional efforts to find work for older germans that have difficulty finding work .
cdu / csu the union wants to cut germany 's non-wage labor costs by lowering unemployment insurance rate from 6.5 percent to 4.5 percent starting 01-01-2006 .
the conservatives also want recipients of long-term unemployment benefits to work for the first two years of a new job at wages outside of industry-wide contracts .
the wage would be up to 10 percent lower than the industry standard in order to encourage employers to hire more people .
the union also wants to repeal job-protection measures -lrb- kündigungsschutz -rrb- for firms with less than 20 employees for the first two years of employment .
non-permanent contracts could also be offered to workers that are already employed - currently such limited contracts are only possible for new employees .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
lastly , the union plans to nix so-called " ich-ags " , which were meant to make it easier for unemployed germans to become self-employed .
the greens the greens want to implement " regionally and sector-specific differentiated " minimum wages .
non-wage labor costs should also be cut in the lower income levels .
those costs would then slowly increase parallel to worker income while the financial gap could be offset by higher taxes on the private income of wealthy individuals .
like the spd , the greens oppose changes to job-protection measures , industry-wide wage negotiations , and worker co-determination .
the greens support raising unemployment benefits in line with the regional cost of living .
the party wants to look at the possibility of reducing working hours with an according reduction of wages during negotiations .
the greens want to expand the efforts of private companies in reducing long-term unemployment . fdp the fdp wants to move wage negotiation away from the currently common industry-wide tariffs and towards more individually-tailored agreements .
wage deals that deviate from the sector norm should be allowed if 75 percent of a firm 's employees back such a move .
workers councils would become mandatory only in companies with more than 20 employees and advisory boards would be reduced in size .
legal job-protection measures would go into effect only after four years on the job and only at firms with more than 50 employees .
the fdp wants to break up the federal labor agency and split its responsibilities among regional job centers . the left party the newly-formed left party wants to roll back the government 's decision to combine welfare and long-term unemployment benefits .
instead of receiving so-called hartz iv benefits , those germans long out of work would be encouraged to take part-time work and would have government aid added as net wages .
the leftist party wants a minimum monthly wage of 1,400 euros and would not change current job-protection measures .
the average work week would be legally limited to 40 hours . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study raises flag on youth unemployment the german economy has chalked up few successes over the past six months , according to a new study by the bertelsmann foundation .
the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying .
-lrb- may 6 , 2005 -rrb- one euro , one way out of unemployment ?
for those out of work , the government has introduced a new category of low-paying jobs to supplement welfare .
so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ?
-lrb- dec .
28 , 2004 -rrb- political parties : on the campaign trail unemployment , taxes , health insurance and social justice are just a few of the topics politicians are wrangling about this campaign season , and every party has a different solution to the country 's problems .

the onus is now on the african union -lrb- au -rrb- to help make a breakthrough . the g4 aspirants are proposing an expansion of the 15-member security council to 25 , including six new permanent seats and have been working towards a vote in the general assembly this month and a decision before a summit of world leaders in september .
but they have come up hard against opposition form the us and china . african union ministers hold the key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura , united nations general assembly president jean ping , india 's foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- not visible -rrb- , and brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim .
germany , india , japan and brazil all know that their bids can not succeed without african support .
" we have exhausted our discussion .
it is now up to african ministers to take a decision , " kenzo oshima , japan 's un ambassador , wearily told reporters on monday . but while au backing would be a major boost in getting the two-thirds support in the 191-member general assembly needed to push through any reforms - the au has 53 members - it is not a guarantee for success . au has own agenda and inner conflict the au has its own demands which do not fit in with the g4 's current plans .
it wants the security council to be expanded to 26 , and says the new permanent seats should have veto rights - a position the g4 already abandoned for lack of support . as well as these conflicting demands , some un diplomats suggest the au is itself ready to split over its own position due to internal arguments over tactics . all in all , the job of ensuring support for a g4 bid from an allegedly fractious and divided au at odds with the ideas of germany , india , japan and brazil is a difficult one . german diplomats have admitted efforts to find a common position could drag on beyond the self-imposed september deadline .
they have warned that those in opposition to security council reform were using " all the spoiling tactics available to them . " aggressive german campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder it could be the last throw of the dice for germany , whose incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder has targeted security council membership as imperative . the germans have waged an aggressive campaign involving shuttle diplomacy and global lobbying but have found themselves accused of promising increased aid to poor african , asian and latin american countries in exchange for support . kazakh ambassador to the un yerzham kazykhanov has claimed that a german envoy asked for support for permanent council membership and proposed greater investment in tapping kazakhstan 's 13.8 billion barrels of oil reserves in return . g4 powers accused of financial incentives and the germans are n't alone .
the prestige and power that comes with a council seat has apparently driven other members of the g4 to offer incentives .
japan invited afghanistan 's foreign minister to tokyo in may to hear its case for a permanent seat and the war-damaged nation was offered an increase in aid , according to un ambassador ravan farhadi . the campaign has led other envoys at the united nations to voice concerns .

japanese and german envoys deny any explicit offers to trade aid for votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2005 opinion : helpless in the face of terrorism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 64 people were killed by bombs in sharm el-sheikh the recent bombings , first in london and now in egypt , and the killing of an innocent man by british police make it clear that we 're increasingly helpless in the face of terrorism . this is the only thing that appears certain : the attacks in london and sharm el-sheikh did n't directly have anything to do with each other .
or at least very little , seeing as there are some parallels : great britain and egypt are both close allies of the united states , and both tony blair and hosni mubarak are presented by al qaeda as stooges of george w. bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharm el-sheikh it is perceived discrimination that leads to violence and terror being directed against the state .
not against its official representatives - for that the terrorists are too cowardly - but rather against innocent people such as underground passengers in london and hotel staff and souvenir hawkers in egypt . the victims are randomly and blindly picked , possibly belonging to the same population group as the perpetrators .
terrorists do n't care about such things .
innocent victims are the " collateral damage " of their battle against the dark forces of the us and its allies - to use the same cynical term that the us itself first used in its fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes was shot dead by british police such " collateral damage " by the british includes the young brazilian man who was practically executed by the british police with five bullets pumped into his head .
why ?
because he came out from the wrong building , wore a coat in summer , looked southern or " oriental " and then fled from the cops .
scotland yard 's statement that it deeply regrets the tragic mistake sounds hollow because it adds that targeted killings remains permissible in special cases . britain treading on dangerous ground " targeted killing " could also be " murder in broad daylight . "
the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .
her majesty 's agents still , however , have carte blanche to first shoot and ask questions later . that makes britain - a recognized democracy - move dangerously close to countries and regimes in the middle east recognized for not being democratic .
egypt , for example , which serves the us as a willing helper in the interrogation of disagreeable suspects in the fight against terror .
washington may have guantanamo , but in egypt torture can take place more nonchalantly . however , the egyptian authorities have n't killed any suspects so far .
they have only arrested dozens of possible witnesses in order to pick up the trail of the perpetrators - perpetrators , who consciously aimed to strike hosni mubarak 's regime at its most sensitive spot : the tourism industry , which brings in lucrative foreign currency . the poor hit the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearful reunions as tourists come home from egypt much like in the aftermath of big attacks in the past , tourists will lose their appetite to spend their holidays in the land of the pharaohs . it 's an understandable sentiment but still a tragic mistake .
after all , avoiding a certain country ca n't protect one from terrorism .
and would people think of canceling their vacations to england ? in the case of egypt , it 's the poor who are worst hit - they are among the victims and they are the ones who will in future sit in front of empty hotels and have nothing to eat .
it 's the same scenario as tsunami-affected regions experienced earlier this year . it might sound macabre , but one is as helpless against terrorism as one was against the seaquake .
you ca n't prevent the quake itself and its deadly waves , but you can reduce its impact through sufficient preventive measures . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london jittery as police arrest third man londoners faced tense underground train trips to work monday fearing that at least four suicide bombers are still on the loose , despite the arrest of a third man by police who are still defending a shoot-to-kill policy .
-lrb- july 25 , 2005 -rrb- egypt blasts pose tough question for tourists as the world condemned the bomb attacks in egypt which killed at least 88 people , foreign tourists began returning home .
the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday .

governors are against creating a " german fbi . " " it 's urgent that the federal criminal office can also act preventatively against terorristic threats , " schily told the german mass daily bild .
until now , the bka , responsible for investigating threats to germany - locally or abroad - passed on tips it had gathered on possible threats and suspects to the state investigative agencies .
the agencies would then act on them and took any sort of preventative measures - like surveillance or arrests - needed . critics , like schily , say the extra step puts up an unnecessary obstacle that could delay quick action on a terror threat . no need for " german fbi " günther beckstein , the conservative interior minister of bavaria and normally a schily ally , disagreed .
" the demand for a german fbi is not one of ours , " beckstein said following the attacks .
security work must happen locally , and " ca n't be organized centrally from berlin . " there are an estimated 300 islamic fundamentalists currently under observation by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution , said schily .
major trials involving planned terrorist attacks or activities are taking place in munich , hamburg and düsseldorf , where members of alleged al qaeda splinter group al-tawhid are on trial for planning attacks on us and israeli targets in germany . though schily was careful to point out that the vast majority of the country 's more than three million muslims was peaceful , fundamentalists continue to pose a major threat to the country . still , he said he did n't " think much of fatalistic predictions that it was only a matter of time before something like what happened in london or madrid happened in germany . "
muslim community needs to cooperate he urged the muslim community to be more active in combating fundamental tendencies among its youth .
" it 's imperative that the muslim community works together with the security services to fight fundamentalism and terrorism , " said schily . though the interior minister continues to push for more competencies , the chances he will get his way are limited by the german constitution , which clearly divides up responsibilities between the federal government and germany 's 16 states .
a reform of germany 's federal structure , pushed by his social democratic party is currently on ice because of new elections .
the same fate will meet his push for more competency for federal investigators . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over security response while 51 percent of germans express concern at the prospect of their country becoming a target for terrorists , politicians are bickering over what action to take to secure the country from attack .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .

" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party .

that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2005 eleven friends and their love of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two friends behind " 11 friends " for the past five years , a scrappy fan-focused soccer magazine has been winning hearts in germany .
a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .
" we are doing this magazine for people like us , " he said .
" people who are aware of their position as a fan , who reflect on it and ask why they 're fans . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scoring in the chancellery in his youth , gerhard schröder was an impressive striker in local soccer leagues .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .
-lrb- july 16 , 2005 -rrb- cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work .
-lrb- april 5 , 2005 -rrb- 9797 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

" now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
" he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper .

he has been runner-up on five occasions .
the top-selling bild newspaper carried armstrong 's words of advice to ullrich , whom he advised to be fitter at the start of a race and " lose a kilo and a half . "
" i really believe jan can win the tour again , " the texan said .
bild was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's words to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

governors are against creating a " german fbi . " " it 's urgent that the federal criminal office can also act preventatively against terorristic threats , " schily told the german mass daily bild .
until now , the bka , responsible for investigating threats to germany - locally or abroad - passed on tips it had gathered on possible threats and suspects to the state investigative agencies .
the agencies would then act on them and took any sort of preventative measures - like surveillance or arrests - needed . critics , like schily , say the extra step puts up an unnecessary obstacle that could delay quick action on a terror threat . no need for " german fbi " günther beckstein , the conservative interior minister of bavaria and normally a schily ally , disagreed .
" the demand for a german fbi is not one of ours , " beckstein said following the attacks .
security work must happen locally , and " ca n't be organized centrally from berlin . " there are an estimated 300 islamic fundamentalists currently under observation by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution , said schily .
major trials involving planned terrorist attacks or activities are taking place in munich , hamburg and düsseldorf , where members of alleged al qaeda splinter group al-tawhid are on trial for planning attacks on us and israeli targets in germany . though schily was careful to point out that the vast majority of the country 's more than three million muslims was peaceful , fundamentalists continue to pose a major threat to the country . still , he said he did n't " think much of fatalistic predictions that it was only a matter of time before something like what happened in london or madrid happened in germany . "
muslim community needs to cooperate he urged the muslim community to be more active in combating fundamental tendencies among its youth .
" it 's imperative that the muslim community works together with the security services to fight fundamentalism and terrorism , " said schily . though the interior minister continues to push for more competencies , the chances he will get his way are limited by the german constitution , which clearly divides up responsibilities between the federal government and germany 's 16 states .

" now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
" he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper .
the paper said if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times . "
he has been runner-up on five occasions .
the top-selling bild newspaper carried armstrong 's words of advice to ullrich , whom he advised to be fitter at the start of a race and " lose a kilo and a half . "
" i really believe jan can win the tour again , " the texan said .
bild was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's words to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 high-speed election campaign gets going großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel : the fight 's officially opened with federal polls now almost sure to take place , germany 's politicians face their shortest ever election campaign .
the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .
she underlined that this time the emphasis would on putting forward the right arguments .
" once you discuss with the people then you quickly realize that they do n't really know what to expect from the cdu . " small parties not exactly ecstatic the big parties may be raring to fight it out at the polls , but it is n't necessarily the same with the smaller ones .
in particular , the green party did n't really want new elections - quite apart from the fact that they were n't even asked about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer enveloped in green at a party conference and to add to the woes of the green party , the cdu is now hitting the campaign trail with a woman at the forefront while the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , their likely coalition partner , have a homosexual man as a leader .
the greens ' macho man joschka fischer is once again expected to lead the party to increase its share of the vote . " that shows very clearly that without the greens , the opposition would n't be where it is today , " said advertising guru heusinger in a defense of his employer . but , convincing electoral arguments probably sound different . kerstin hilt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections prompt reserved optimism with the green light given by german president horst köhler , most politicians and people expect to vote on september 18 .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party .

that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .
she underlined that this time the emphasis would on putting forward the right arguments .
" once you discuss with the people then you quickly realize that they do n't really know what to expect from the cdu . " small parties not exactly ecstatic the big parties may be raring to fight it out at the polls , but it is n't necessarily the same with the smaller ones .
in particular , the green party did n't really want new elections - quite apart from the fact that they were n't even asked about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer enveloped in green at a party conference and to add to the woes of the green party , the cdu is now hitting the campaign trail with a woman at the forefront while the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , their likely coalition partner , have a homosexual man as a leader .
the greens ' macho man joschka fischer is once again expected to lead the party to increase its share of the vote .

the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .

or at least very little , seeing as there are some parallels : great britain and egypt are both close allies of the united states , and both tony blair and hosni mubarak are presented by al qaeda as stooges of george w. bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sharm el-sheikh it is perceived discrimination that leads to violence and terror being directed against the state .
not against its official representatives - for that the terrorists are too cowardly - but rather against innocent people such as underground passengers in london and hotel staff and souvenir hawkers in egypt . the victims are randomly and blindly picked , possibly belonging to the same population group as the perpetrators .
terrorists do n't care about such things .
innocent victims are the " collateral damage " of their battle against the dark forces of the us and its allies - to use the same cynical term that the us itself first used in its fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes was shot dead by british police such " collateral damage " by the british includes the young brazilian man who was practically executed by the british police with five bullets pumped into his head .
why ?
because he came out from the wrong building , wore a coat in summer , looked southern or " oriental " and then fled from the cops .
scotland yard 's statement that it deeply regrets the tragic mistake sounds hollow because it adds that targeted killings remains permissible in special cases . britain treading on dangerous ground " targeted killing " could also be " murder in broad daylight . "
the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .
her majesty 's agents still , however , have carte blanche to first shoot and ask questions later . that makes britain - a recognized democracy - move dangerously close to countries and regimes in the middle east recognized for not being democratic .
egypt , for example , which serves the us as a willing helper in the interrogation of disagreeable suspects in the fight against terror .
washington may have guantanamo , but in egypt torture can take place more nonchalantly . however , the egyptian authorities have n't killed any suspects so far .

after all , avoiding a certain country ca n't protect one from terrorism .
and would people think of canceling their vacations to england ? in the case of egypt , it 's the poor who are worst hit - they are among the victims and they are the ones who will in future sit in front of empty hotels and have nothing to eat .
it 's the same scenario as tsunami-affected regions experienced earlier this year . it might sound macabre , but one is as helpless against terrorism as one was against the seaquake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 high-speed election campaign gets going großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel : the fight 's officially opened with federal polls now almost sure to take place , germany 's politicians face their shortest ever election campaign .
the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date . bernd heusinger managed just four hours of sleep thursday night after german president horst köhler gave the go-ahead for the dissolution of the parliament paving the way for early federal elections in september . in fact , heusinger who 's organizing the election campaign for the green party , the junior coalition partner in the current government , has had to do make do with very little shuteye ever since chancellor gerhard schröder made the shock announcement - on the evening of may 22 after a humiliating defeat for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in its traditional stronghold state of northrhine-westphalia - that he would seek a new mandate from the people a year earlier than scheduled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heusinger 's ad agency is a flurry of activity these days heusinger 's advertising agency " zum goldenen hirsch " has been in overdrive ever since .
whereas heusinger had over a year to organize the greens ' election campaign the last time , this time round he only has about four weeks . though the advertising expert admits that everything will be toned down a bit this time with six rather than 12 campaign posters and other paraphernalia , he says the work wo n't be any easier .
" when compared to the last one in 2002 , this election campaign is going to be at least as stressful , " heusinger said . more emphasis on content equally stressful maybe , but , according to experts , the campaign could turn out to be quite different in some aspects . " precisely because of the short preparatory time , election advertising will this time play a much lesser role than usual , " said wolfgang donsbach , a dresden-based communication expert .
" this campaign will be more about content and that 's why it 's likely to be more exciting than previous ones . " unsurprisingly , experts say the key tussle between the campaigning parties is likely to be about labor and a fair reform of the social system .
but , though the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - largely expected to win the election - is expected to do everything it can to paint chancellor schröder 's spd as a job-killer , experts warn that it does n't automatically mean that the cdu can pick up votes on the basis of this issue . " the cdu has to gradually reveal what it actually wants in concrete terms , " said donsbach .
the party 's new platform may make things a bit clearer , but it 's not enough , according to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter radunski the veteran cdu campaign manager and former senator for science in berlin , peter radunksi -lrb- photo -rrb- however sees things differently .
" when it comes to managing economic issues , the cdu leads the way in voters ' minds and that 's not going to change in the coming weeks , " radunksi said .
" frankly , between you and me , i would n't want to be campaign manager for the spd this time , not for a million dollars . " the new left is more of a threat the sentiment is understandable .
considering that the spd voluntarily gave up power , it 's a bit difficult to grasp how the party could still legitimately urge people to vote for it .
" we 're in a unique moment in time right now , " said radunksi .
" the spd is leading an opposition election campaign and the cdu , as the real opposition , is almost presenting itself as a governing party . " fittingly , the spd , according to experts , has named its combative yet vague platform an " election manifesto " - something that really does n't sound like an invitation to further governance , according to communication expert donsbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine at the same time , experts warn that it would be rash to assume that the cdu has almost won the elections .
that 's because though the spd may not prove much of a threat , a political grouping from a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties has many worried in the cdu .
the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism which has joined forces with a breakaway leftist grouping led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , now has the support of 12 percent of voters . the new grouping - if it did manage to get into parliament - would n't just cost the cdu a possible absolute majority , but could also actually rob it off votes .
" the cdu can traditionally fish for votes on the right-wing fringe , " said donsbach .
" but it 's precisely these extremist voters who could defect to the new political left simply because they 're the loudest voice against everything . " spd has work cut out the spd however seems relatively unconcerned about the new left .
" in my constituency , i still have n't come across a single politician from the new left , " said katja mast , who is a direct candidate for the spd in pforzheim-enz in the heart of the state of baden-württemberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaja mast , left mast added that the people there at the grassroots were n't complaining at all ever since chancellor schröder announced he would voluntarily renounce power .
" naturally , there was a moment of shock .
but now people are saying , ' let 's do it this time . " ' but , since baden-württemberg will enjoy holidays until a week before the planned federal elections on sept .
18 , katja mast is likely to have quite an unusual election campaign - no huge events , rather just hard back-breaking work in an effort to reach potential voters . " we 'll go to the swimming pools , to street festivals and beach volleyball tournaments and really talk to the people , " mast said .

" care must always be taken with taxes , but with goods which are already very expensive , we can consider a third rate of vat , " fischer told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
however , in an early general election salvo , fischer , a member of the junior partner in the government coalition , the greens , criticized proposals by the opposition conservatives to raise the general rate of vat in germany from 16 percent to 18 percent .
" an across-the-board rise in vat reduces people 's buying power , " fischer said .
angela merkel , the christian democratic challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in the election on september 18 , has proposed using the increased receipts from vat to help reduce unemployment which is hovering around the five million mark .
but schröder 's social democrats and the greens believe raising the tax would be a counterproductive measure which would penalize the poor more than the rich . dw-world.de industry does n't want schröder for germany 's elite there can only be one person to lead the country forward : angela merkel .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .
-lrb- july 16 , 2005 -rrb- cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday .
" now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
" he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper .
the paper said if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times . "
he has been runner-up on five occasions .
the top-selling bild newspaper carried armstrong 's words of advice to ullrich , whom he advised to be fitter at the start of a race and " lose a kilo and a half . "
" i really believe jan can win the tour again , " the texan said .
bild was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's words to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .

why ?
because he came out from the wrong building , wore a coat in summer , looked southern or " oriental " and then fled from the cops .
scotland yard 's statement that it deeply regrets the tragic mistake sounds hollow because it adds that targeted killings remains permissible in special cases . britain treading on dangerous ground " targeted killing " could also be " murder in broad daylight . "
the latter is how the liquidation of radical palestinians by israel is condemned throughout the world as well as the shooting of ira radicals by british agents in gibraltar years ago .
her majesty 's agents still , however , have carte blanche to first shoot and ask questions later . that makes britain - a recognized democracy - move dangerously close to countries and regimes in the middle east recognized for not being democratic .
egypt , for example , which serves the us as a willing helper in the interrogation of disagreeable suspects in the fight against terror .
washington may have guantanamo , but in egypt torture can take place more nonchalantly . however , the egyptian authorities have n't killed any suspects so far .

" now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
" he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper .
the paper said if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times . "
he has been runner-up on five occasions .
the top-selling bild newspaper carried armstrong 's words of advice to ullrich , whom he advised to be fitter at the start of a race and " lose a kilo and a half . "
" i really believe jan can win the tour again , " the texan said .
bild was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's words to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2005 last chance talks for g4 un hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after cosy but ultimately failed talks in new york , the g4 head to london diplomats from germany , india , japan , brazil and the african union meet in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expanding the un security council by september . it is being billed as a " make-or-break " meeting for the four united nations security council hopefuls . foreign ministers from germany , india , japan and brazil meet with their african union counterparts in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expansion of the un security council by september . while the common goal is a seat at the powerful table alongside the united states , france , britain , russia and china , there is no certainty that the g4 hopefuls will be successful in their negotiations as last week 's failure in new york to achieve a joint position showed .
the onus is now on the african union -lrb- au -rrb- to help make a breakthrough . the g4 aspirants are proposing an expansion of the 15-member security council to 25 , including six new permanent seats and have been working towards a vote in the general assembly this month and a decision before a summit of world leaders in september .
but they have come up hard against opposition form the us and china . african union ministers hold the key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura , united nations general assembly president jean ping , india 's foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- not visible -rrb- , and brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim .
germany , india , japan and brazil all know that their bids can not succeed without african support .
" we have exhausted our discussion .
it is now up to african ministers to take a decision , " kenzo oshima , japan 's un ambassador , wearily told reporters on monday . but while au backing would be a major boost in getting the two-thirds support in the 191-member general assembly needed to push through any reforms - the au has 53 members - it is not a guarantee for success . au has own agenda and inner conflict the au has its own demands which do not fit in with the g4 's current plans .
it wants the security council to be expanded to 26 , and says the new permanent seats should have veto rights - a position the g4 already abandoned for lack of support . as well as these conflicting demands , some un diplomats suggest the au is itself ready to split over its own position due to internal arguments over tactics . all in all , the job of ensuring support for a g4 bid from an allegedly fractious and divided au at odds with the ideas of germany , india , japan and brazil is a difficult one . german diplomats have admitted efforts to find a common position could drag on beyond the self-imposed september deadline .
they have warned that those in opposition to security council reform were using " all the spoiling tactics available to them . " aggressive german campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder it could be the last throw of the dice for germany , whose incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder has targeted security council membership as imperative . the germans have waged an aggressive campaign involving shuttle diplomacy and global lobbying but have found themselves accused of promising increased aid to poor african , asian and latin american countries in exchange for support . kazakh ambassador to the un yerzham kazykhanov has claimed that a german envoy asked for support for permanent council membership and proposed greater investment in tapping kazakhstan 's 13.8 billion barrels of oil reserves in return . g4 powers accused of financial incentives and the germans are n't alone .
the prestige and power that comes with a council seat has apparently driven other members of the g4 to offer incentives .
japan invited afghanistan 's foreign minister to tokyo in may to hear its case for a permanent seat and the war-damaged nation was offered an increase in aid , according to un ambassador ravan farhadi . the campaign has led other envoys at the united nations to voice concerns .
lobbying by the g4 would be " judged as unethical or worse " if it occurred in a national election , pakistani ambassador munir akram said in a july 11 speech to the un general assembly . germany , japan deny any wrong-doing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoriko kawaguchi , left , foreign minister of japan , and joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany .
japanese and german envoys deny any explicit offers to trade aid for votes .
dirk rotenberg , spokesman for the german mission , told bloomberg that investment in kazakhstan or other developing nations has " nothing to do " with the outcome of the g4 proposal .
yoshifumo okamura , special un envoy for japan , added in the same article that there was no direct connection between japanese aid to afghanistan and security council membership . with the stakes so evidently high for those involved in the talks in london on monday , nothing less than successful negotiations will do . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 , au still at a stalemate over un reforms brazil , germany , india and japan reached no compromise with the african union -lrb- au -rrb- sunday , but agreed to press on with negotiations to overcome remaining differences over the proposed reforms of the un security council .
-lrb- july 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany on un diplomatic offensive after rejection by the us of a draft resolution by germany and three other countries for permanent un security council seats , berlin and its allies are going on the offensive to drum up support for their plan .

the onus is now on the african union -lrb- au -rrb- to help make a breakthrough . the g4 aspirants are proposing an expansion of the 15-member security council to 25 , including six new permanent seats and have been working towards a vote in the general assembly this month and a decision before a summit of world leaders in september .

it is now up to african ministers to take a decision , " kenzo oshima , japan 's un ambassador , wearily told reporters on monday . but while au backing would be a major boost in getting the two-thirds support in the 191-member general assembly needed to push through any reforms - the au has 53 members - it is not a guarantee for success . au has own agenda and inner conflict the au has its own demands which do not fit in with the g4 's current plans .
it wants the security council to be expanded to 26 , and says the new permanent seats should have veto rights - a position the g4 already abandoned for lack of support . as well as these conflicting demands , some un diplomats suggest the au is itself ready to split over its own position due to internal arguments over tactics . all in all , the job of ensuring support for a g4 bid from an allegedly fractious and divided au at odds with the ideas of germany , india , japan and brazil is a difficult one . german diplomats have admitted efforts to find a common position could drag on beyond the self-imposed september deadline .

the prestige and power that comes with a council seat has apparently driven other members of the g4 to offer incentives .
japan invited afghanistan 's foreign minister to tokyo in may to hear its case for a permanent seat and the war-damaged nation was offered an increase in aid , according to un ambassador ravan farhadi . the campaign has led other envoys at the united nations to voice concerns .

yoshifumo okamura , special un envoy for japan , added in the same article that there was no direct connection between japanese aid to afghanistan and security council membership . with the stakes so evidently high for those involved in the talks in london on monday , nothing less than successful negotiations will do . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 , au still at a stalemate over un reforms brazil , germany , india and japan reached no compromise with the african union -lrb- au -rrb- sunday , but agreed to press on with negotiations to overcome remaining differences over the proposed reforms of the un security council .

however , none of the bombers are thought to be among them . the times , quoting unnamed police sources , said a fifth bomber could be on the loose , and more heavily armed undercover police would be deployed in the investigation .
it said a suspect package found in a west london park on saturday contained a fifth abandoned explosive device , suggesting another bomber was at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police outside stockwell station police were reportedly sending more armed officers onto the streets of london in search of the bombers who tried to blow up three underground trains and a bus last week , in a repeat of a suicide attack by four other men which killed 56 people including the bombers on july 7 . police stick by shoot-to-kill policy as the probe into the bombings gained momentum , london police were also struggling to defend a shoot-to-kill policy which cost the life of a brazilian electrician who was shot dead after police mistook him for a suicide bomber on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean charles de menezes brazilian foreign minister celso amorim , on a trip to london , demanded a " full investigation " into the killing of 27-year-old jean charles de menezes . british foreign secretary jack straw straw spoke by telephone with amorim on sunday to express his regrets , but said police must have recourse to lethal force to stop a suicide bomber triggering his device . metropolitan police commissioner ian blair apologized for the menezes shooting but also stressed that police had to act decisively when confronted with such a threat .
" the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " he said .
the commissioner also refused to rule out further tragic mistakes in the hunt for suicide terrorists , saying : " somebody else could be shot . " terrified passengers scattered in panic as plain-clothed police chased menezes through stockwell underground station in south london on friday after he failed to stop when challenged .
witnesses said the brazilian looked " like a cornered rabbit " when he fell to the floor in a train carriage and was shot five times in the head by plain-clothed police . " public trust shaken " as with all police-related deaths , the independent police complaints commission will investigate the shooting but islamic groups , worried that muslims could be targeted , have called for a public inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers , search the bag of a commuter at london bridge train station on monday , the british press said the shooting raised " troubling questions " about the conduct of the police investigation and could not have come at a worse time for community relations . " now public trust in the police in ethnic communities , which holds a key to identifying terrorists , has understandably been badly shaken , " the guardian said in an editorial . the daily telegraph reflected growing public anxiety about the failure of the police to catch the bombers despite the massive manhunt .
" we have their images on camera as well as the bombs they left behind ...
yet , at the time of going to press , all four bombers seem to be still on the loose , " it wrote . as the controversy over the shooting raged , the police commissioner said the investigation was advancing quickly and detectives believed that the four suspects in thursday 's attacks were still in britain .
the paper added that " troubling questions " hung over the police service .
" we ask whether the met is getting the leadership it deserves , " it said . wealth of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the suspects in an image captured on cctv unconfirmed reports said the wanted men were believed to be of east african origin and were associates of the four july 7 suicide bombers , identified by police as british-born muslims of pakistani descent and a jamaican-born briton who had converted to islam . a wealth of evidence has been gathered from the abandoned bombs .
police are hoping the investigation will catch not only the bombers but the masterminds behind them .
documents found in one of the abandoned rucksacks have reportedly led police toward a possible link between the two groups of attackers , although so far only circumstantial connections have been made public . some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have gone on a whitewater rafting " bonding " trip in wales with two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which have been plastered all over london . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police stick by policy despite wrong killing london 's police chief said he deeply regretted the killing of an innocent brazilian in the hunt for the attackers , but added that police remain under orders to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head if necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2005 eleven friends and their love of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two friends behind " 11 friends " for the past five years , a scrappy fan-focused soccer magazine has been winning hearts in germany .
a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .
" we are doing this magazine for people like us , " he said .
" people who are aware of their position as a fan , who reflect on it and ask why they 're fans . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scoring in the chancellery in his youth , gerhard schröder was an impressive striker in local soccer leagues .
his love for the game has n't let up since .
over the weekend , he opened a soccer exhibit - in the first floor of his office .
-lrb- july 18 , 2005 -rrb- the specter of hooliganism returns german soccer hooligans have made a violent return to the international stage with just over a year to go before germany hosts the 2006 world cup .
officials have faith in security measures but experts predict trouble .
-lrb- april 7 , 2005 -rrb- world soccer made in germany germany has become famous around the world for soccer , especially because next year 's world cup takes place here .
but another reason for german soccer 's fame is a university coach training program in cologne .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans .

olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .

we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .

they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation .

the spd plans to eliminate the differences between the new unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless -lrb- arbeitslosengeld ii -rrb- in eastern and western germany by hiking eastern germans ' monthly check to 345 euros .
older recipients of unemployment benefits will have an extra two years -lrb- 01-02-2008 not 01-02-2006 as had been planned -rrb- before their unemployment benefits are slashed to the new lower levels .
other germans without work have 12 months before their benefits are cut to the arbeitslosengeld ii level .
the spd wants to spend 250 million euros for regional efforts to find work for older germans that have difficulty finding work .
cdu / csu the union wants to cut germany 's non-wage labor costs by lowering unemployment insurance rate from 6.5 percent to 4.5 percent starting 01-01-2006 .
the conservatives also want recipients of long-term unemployment benefits to work for the first two years of a new job at wages outside of industry-wide contracts .
the wage would be up to 10 percent lower than the industry standard in order to encourage employers to hire more people .
the union also wants to repeal job-protection measures -lrb- kündigungsschutz -rrb- for firms with less than 20 employees for the first two years of employment .
non-permanent contracts could also be offered to workers that are already employed - currently such limited contracts are only possible for new employees .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
lastly , the union plans to nix so-called " ich-ags " , which were meant to make it easier for unemployed germans to become self-employed .
the greens the greens want to implement " regionally and sector-specific differentiated " minimum wages .
non-wage labor costs should also be cut in the lower income levels .
those costs would then slowly increase parallel to worker income while the financial gap could be offset by higher taxes on the private income of wealthy individuals .
like the spd , the greens oppose changes to job-protection measures , industry-wide wage negotiations , and worker co-determination .
the greens support raising unemployment benefits in line with the regional cost of living .
the party wants to look at the possibility of reducing working hours with an according reduction of wages during negotiations .
the greens want to expand the efforts of private companies in reducing long-term unemployment . fdp the fdp wants to move wage negotiation away from the currently common industry-wide tariffs and towards more individually-tailored agreements .
wage deals that deviate from the sector norm should be allowed if 75 percent of a firm 's employees back such a move .
workers councils would become mandatory only in companies with more than 20 employees and advisory boards would be reduced in size .
legal job-protection measures would go into effect only after four years on the job and only at firms with more than 50 employees .
the fdp wants to break up the federal labor agency and split its responsibilities among regional job centers . the left party the newly-formed left party wants to roll back the government 's decision to combine welfare and long-term unemployment benefits .
instead of receiving so-called hartz iv benefits , those germans long out of work would be encouraged to take part-time work and would have government aid added as net wages .
the leftist party wants a minimum monthly wage of 1,400 euros and would not change current job-protection measures .
the average work week would be legally limited to 40 hours . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study raises flag on youth unemployment the german economy has chalked up few successes over the past six months , according to a new study by the bertelsmann foundation .

the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .
-lrb- july 16 , 2005 -rrb- cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines at unemployment offices are growing more than five million germans are out of work : reducing unemployment is the election 's most important topic . spd the spd wants all industries to implement nationwide minimum wages on their own - otherwise the party will push for a legally mandated minimum wage .
the social democrats are opposed to weakening germany 's job-protection measures -lrb- kündigungsschutz -rrb- and is against legislation that would interfere with the ability of unions and employers to negotiate wages for their respective industries .
worker co-determination - where employees are legally entitled to be represented on company boards - is not up for discussion .
the spd plans to eliminate the differences between the new unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless -lrb- arbeitslosengeld ii -rrb- in eastern and western germany by hiking eastern germans ' monthly check to 345 euros .
older recipients of unemployment benefits will have an extra two years -lrb- 01-02-2008 not 01-02-2006 as had been planned -rrb- before their unemployment benefits are slashed to the new lower levels .
other germans without work have 12 months before their benefits are cut to the arbeitslosengeld ii level .
the spd wants to spend 250 million euros for regional efforts to find work for older germans that have difficulty finding work .
cdu / csu the union wants to cut germany 's non-wage labor costs by lowering unemployment insurance rate from 6.5 percent to 4.5 percent starting 01-01-2006 .
the conservatives also want recipients of long-term unemployment benefits to work for the first two years of a new job at wages outside of industry-wide contracts .
the wage would be up to 10 percent lower than the industry standard in order to encourage employers to hire more people .
the union also wants to repeal job-protection measures -lrb- kündigungsschutz -rrb- for firms with less than 20 employees for the first two years of employment .
non-permanent contracts could also be offered to workers that are already employed - currently such limited contracts are only possible for new employees .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
lastly , the union plans to nix so-called " ich-ags " , which were meant to make it easier for unemployed germans to become self-employed .
the greens the greens want to implement " regionally and sector-specific differentiated " minimum wages .
non-wage labor costs should also be cut in the lower income levels .
those costs would then slowly increase parallel to worker income while the financial gap could be offset by higher taxes on the private income of wealthy individuals .
like the spd , the greens oppose changes to job-protection measures , industry-wide wage negotiations , and worker co-determination .
the greens support raising unemployment benefits in line with the regional cost of living .
the party wants to look at the possibility of reducing working hours with an according reduction of wages during negotiations .
the greens want to expand the efforts of private companies in reducing long-term unemployment . fdp the fdp wants to move wage negotiation away from the currently common industry-wide tariffs and towards more individually-tailored agreements .
wage deals that deviate from the sector norm should be allowed if 75 percent of a firm 's employees back such a move .
workers councils would become mandatory only in companies with more than 20 employees and advisory boards would be reduced in size .
legal job-protection measures would go into effect only after four years on the job and only at firms with more than 50 employees .
the fdp wants to break up the federal labor agency and split its responsibilities among regional job centers . the left party the newly-formed left party wants to roll back the government 's decision to combine welfare and long-term unemployment benefits .
instead of receiving so-called hartz iv benefits , those germans long out of work would be encouraged to take part-time work and would have government aid added as net wages .
the leftist party wants a minimum monthly wage of 1,400 euros and would not change current job-protection measures .
the average work week would be legally limited to 40 hours . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study raises flag on youth unemployment the german economy has chalked up few successes over the past six months , according to a new study by the bertelsmann foundation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2005 eleven friends and their love of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two friends behind " 11 friends " for the past five years , a scrappy fan-focused soccer magazine has been winning hearts in germany .
a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice . born out of the friendship of two crazed soccer fans who met on the grandstand of the bielefeld stadium , it 's no surprise 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- reads more like a love letter than a typical sports magazine .
instead of news from the transfer market , player ratings and dispassionate post-match analysis , the magazine offers odes to famous teams and goals of the century and is full of ironic - sometimes biting - commentary on the state of the game . " it 's a misconception that a game only lasts 90 minutes , " said phillip köster -lrb- above photo , right -rrb- , the magazine 's co-founder and editor-in-chief .
" in reality , it lasts much longer than that for many of the fans . " the needs of the " greater soccer movement " when köster , 33 , started the magazine with reinaldo coddou -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , a fellow arminia bielefeld fan , in 2000 , they wanted to create a fanzine along the lines of england 's when saturday comes , that would resonate with fans across germany . after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy through the media crisis of three years ago , 11 freunde has evolved into a clear fan favorite , boasting a circulation of 75,000 and a subscriber list of around 13,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent issue carries a cover which appeals to fans to " get the game back ! "
others are starting to notice .
olympia verlag , which puts out the german soccer news bible kicker every week , debuted a soccer culture magazine this week called rund -lrb- round -rrb- .
like 11 freunde , it 's written and edited by journalists who used to publish fanzines .
unlike 11 freunde 's smooth paper publication with a retro-look layout , rund is glossy and slick and says it is looking to reach a broader cross-section of fans .
" we do n't want to reach niches , but the greater soccer movement in this country , " said rund 's editor-in-chief rainer schäfer , who used to edit the fc st. pauli fan magazine viertel vor fünf -lrb- a quarter to five -rrb- in hamburg .
" there are apparently one million germans who want more information on soccer and there are very few titles out there . " indeed , most german soccer fans pick up kicker , which typically features shorter news articles , match reports , player profiles and ratings and insider information .
sport bild , a subsidiary product of germany 's biggest tabloid , offers lighter features and game reports . a survivor there have been attempts to create something as lasting as when saturday comes before in germany .
the most recent , hattrick , folded in the late 1990s because it lacked the power of a publishing house behind it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : written by fans , but not necessarily only for fans 11 freunde was threatened with the same fate before cologne-based publisher intro verlag , impressed by the small magazine 's steadily growing subscriber rate , offered to market it in 2003 .
the change was visible in the next issue , which doubled in size thanks to big ads from companies like postbank and puma . " before that we were perpetually just short of closing down .
we had thousands of euros in debt , " said köster .
" but because we had 3,000 subscribers we could n't just shut it down . " the new-found muscle has had its positives and its negatives , admits köster .
as his small publication has grown and gained in relevance in germany 's soccer community , some of the bite - and the traditional fan 's lament that soccer has become too commercialized - has been taken out . fans wary of increasing commercialization " we have a certain relevance now , " said köster , pointing to the letter from the president of the soccer club 1 .
fc cologne hanging in his office .
" which is not always great . " still , given the choice between insolvency and a slightly more commercial tilt , köster says he and coddou decided to choose the latter .
they moved from a small office in berlin 's working class kreuzberg neighborhood to breezy , light-filled split-level digs in a quiet neighborhood near the city center a year ago .
rather than write all the articles himself using a pseudonym , as he did for the first two years , köster now has a small staff and freelancers to relieve the burden . fans remain supporters of the magazine , even if it has undergone a slight transformation . " many people have complained that it 's gotten too commercial , " said johannes stender , fan of the 1 .
fc kaiserslautern soccer club and editor of the team 's fanzine .
but he remains a subscriber and pointed to a recent issue with a cover story offering fans tips on how to reclaim the game . " the topics are not just fan topics , but involve the entire game , " he said . the deeper fan in the coming bundesliga season , 11 freunde plans to run a half-hour television show on pay tv channel premiere , which will be hosted by actor peter lohmeyer .
outside of that , köster hopes the magazine will stay just the way it is and continue to offer the average fan a chance to think a bit deeper .
" we are doing this magazine for people like us , " he said .
" people who are aware of their position as a fan , who reflect on it and ask why they 're fans .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 25.07.2005 taxes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where should the taxes come from and how much is required ?
there are two main issues related to taxation in this election : reforming the highly complicated tax system and making it more just .
just who or what will be taxed and how much is at stake depends on the party . spd discussion of germany 's value added tax is making waves this election campaign .
the spd believes raising the vat would be a " step in the wrong direction , " but the party 's official platform does not reject hiking the consumption tax outright .
the social democrats are pushing a " wealth tax " on yearly income over 250,000 euros .
that would raise the top tax rate to 45 percent from the current 42 percent .
the party has n't delved into specifics for its plans for corporate taxes , however , the spd has said its goal would be to eventually tax both publicly and privately held firms at the same rate .
tax rates for publicly traded companies could be cut from 25 percent to 19 percent , but the spd has not explained how it would finance such a reduction .
bills up to 600 euros for tradesmen such as carpenters or plumbers for private households could also be deducted from income taxes in the next two years . cdu / csu cdu and csu want to increase the vat from 16 to 18 percent from 01-01-2006 in order to lower non-wage labor costs .
the lowest bracket for income taxes would be cut from 15 to 12 percent and the top rate would decrease from 42 to 39 percent .
the conservatives would keep a local business tax know as gewerbesteuer , but corporate taxes would drop from 25 to 22 percent .
to offset those cuts , tax loopholes and subsidies would be shut including tax breaks for commuters and wages earned on sunday , holidays and nights .
inheritance taxes on family-run companies would be scrapped if the firm continues operation under the heirs for the following 10 years .
the union wants to introduce a tax-free income amount of 8,000 euros for all individuals , including children which could be used by their parents .
the conservatives have not yet determined if there would be changes to the kindergeld money germans receive to help support children . the greens the greens oppose raising the vat , but back eliminating tax breaks including subsidies for agriculture and coalmining .
the party supports low taxes for the middle class , but wants the rich to pay more .
how much more has not yet been decided , however .
the greens also propose implementing a wealth tax on private assets .
taxation for companies and individuals would remain differentiated and corporate tax revenues would be stabilized by increasing the base for minimum tax .
the greens want to change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
the environmental tax ökosteuer would not be increased . fdp the fdp is against raising the vat .
instead the market-oriented party want to introduce a three-step income tax model with rates of 15 , 25 and 35 percent .
the tax-free income amount would be 7,700 euros .
the fdp would also revamp corporate taxes with a top bracket of 25 percent and the municipal business tax , gewerbesteuer , would be scrapped .
to replace the loss in tax revenue , local governments would receive a larger portion of the sales tax and there would be surcharges on income and corporate taxes .
over the long-term , the fdp proposes introducing a flat-tax system .
the left party the leftists would leave the vat at 16 percent , but would cut it to only 7 percent on purchases of medicine and work done by the trades , such as plumbers or electricians .
the left party would leave the lowest income tax bracket at 15 percent but it would increase the tax-free allowance to 12,000 euros per year .
the top tax rate would be increased to 50 percent on all annual income over 60,000 euros .
the party would also introduce a wealth tax for people with yearly income over 300,000 euros and would reintroduce a sales tax for stock market transactions .
like the greens , the left party would change the business tax gewerbesteuer into a communal economic tax that would take more account of income from interest , rent and leasing .
in order to sink non-wage labor costs , the left party would no longer have companies pay into the social security system according to the amount of employees they have , but would rather measure how much the firms contribute to the economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

the protein , kdi tripeptide , works by blocking the harmful effects of a substance present in degenerative brain diseases and spinal cord injuries .
by blocking this substance , called glutamate , kdi prevents permanent cell death and helps the body heal itself .
the finnish work from the university of helsinki will be published online by the journal of neuroscience research .
human trials so far the researchers have tested kdi in the lab on animals and nerve cells from humans . "
i think it is totally feasible we would be ready to start human clinical trials within a year " lead researcher dr päivi liesi the findings have been promising and they hope to be able to begin treating people with nerve and degenerative brain diseases , such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , using kdi injections within a year .
since kdi occurs naturally in some form in the body , researchers do not believe it will have major toxic side effects .
none have been noted during their work to date .
lead researcher dr päivi liesi said : " we have had such good results with animals that i think it is totally feasible we would be ready to start human clinical trials within a year . "
currently , kdi has to be injected as a solution directly to the damaged area .
however , in the future it might be possible to make the treatment as an oral drug or an intravenous injection , said dr liesi .
future promise her work builds on that of dr george martin from the national institute on ageing , at the us national institutes of health , who first discovered the molecule that kdi is derived from .
dr martin said : " this represents a new approach and one with considerable promise .
" when you look at the potential for preventing spinal cord injury progressing to total lack of physical control , to the fact that people could regenerate and regain their lives , this could be enormously important . "
dr hugh pearson , from the alzheimer 's research trust and the school of biomedical sciences at leeds university , said : " this is an interesting study , though while the peptide has some significance for alzheimer 's disease treatment , it would be in slowing the mental decline associated with the disease .
it does not represent a cure .
side effects " kdi will not generate new neurons but will increase the connections between the remaining neurons in the patient 's brain .
" there is some evidence that this can improve cognition in alzheimer 's disease patients . "
he said there might be problems with delivery of kdi - the tripeptide would be broken down by the body if given orally or intravenously .
although the researchers do not expect side effects , he said the peptide could upset the balance of electrical activity in neurons and this might have some short to long term side effects .
" while there are some benefits , this approach is perhaps more significant for spinal cord repair than for alzheimer 's disease , where neurite outgrowth and reconnection of nerve cells with their target will provide long-lasting repair of damage . "

he said they were now producing a financial recovery plan to identify ways of further reducing costs by £ 3m .
he said : " at this stage we are looking at a full range of options , can not totally discount any service changes , can not totally discount any staff cuts , but clearly we want to avoid those as far as is possible so we are urgently looking at the full range of options . "

police carried out a controlled explosion on the package found on saturday in bushes in little wormwood scrubs , a park not far from the prison .
the bbc 's daniel sandford said : " it does look as if that was planned to be a fifth bomb for use last thursday . "
it may mean a fifth bomber is on the run .
police have cctv pictures of four suspects from thursday 's failed blasts .
three tube trains and a bus were targeted on thursday , two weeks after suicide bombers killed 52 people in a series of explosions .
warren street , shepherd 's bush and oval tube stations were evacuated between 1225 bst and 1245 bst after reports of a bang and the smell of smoke .
police appealed for information based on the cctv images in pictures an hour later the driver of a number 26 bus to hackney wick heard a bang on the top deck and found a rucksack had exploded and blown out the windows .
no-one was seriously hurt .
more than 500 people have contacted police after cctv images were released of four men police believe are connected to the failed attacks .
but scotland yard has confirmed none of the three men being held under the terrorism act are the four men featured in the pictures and a major manhunt is still under way .
home affairs correspondent daniel sandford said the package found in bushes in little wormwood scrubs appeared to be a similar design to those used on thursday , with explosives , nails and shrapnel .
" it does look as if it was a fifth bomb , a bomb of very similar design to one of those used on thursday , one of those that failed to go off .
" the police feel they may now not be looking for four bombers , but for five bombers . "
anti terrorism hotline 0800 789 321 searches are continuing and the area is still cordoned off .
anti-terrorist branch chief peter clarke said : " the object appears to have been left in the bushes , rather than hidden .
" naturally this is a matter of concern , and i would urge the public to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious items or activity . "
police want anyone who saw anything suspicious around the park to call the anti-terrorism hotline , which they are also asking londoners to store in their mobile phones .

police carried out a controlled explosion on the package found on saturday in bushes in little wormwood scrubs , a park not far from the prison .
the bbc 's daniel sandford said : " it does look as if that was planned to be a fifth bomb for use last thursday . "
it may mean a fifth bomber is on the run .
police have cctv pictures of four suspects from thursday 's failed blasts .
three tube trains and a bus were targeted on thursday , two weeks after suicide bombers killed 52 people in a series of explosions .
warren street , shepherd 's bush and oval tube stations were evacuated between 1225 bst and 1245 bst after reports of a bang and the smell of smoke .
police appealed for information based on the cctv images in pictures an hour later the driver of a number 26 bus to hackney wick heard a bang on the top deck and found a rucksack had exploded and blown out the windows .
no-one was seriously hurt .
more than 500 people have contacted police after cctv images were released of four men police believe are connected to the failed attacks .
but scotland yard has confirmed none of the three men being held under the terrorism act are the four men featured in the pictures and a major manhunt is still under way .
home affairs correspondent daniel sandford said the package found in bushes in little wormwood scrubs appeared to be a similar design to those used on thursday , with explosives , nails and shrapnel .
" it does look as if it was a fifth bomb , a bomb of very similar design to one of those used on thursday , one of those that failed to go off .
" the police feel they may now not be looking for four bombers , but for five bombers . "
anti terrorism hotline 0800 789 321 searches are continuing and the area is still cordoned off .
anti-terrorist branch chief peter clarke said : " the object appears to have been left in the bushes , rather than hidden .
" naturally this is a matter of concern , and i would urge the public to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious items or activity . "
police want anyone who saw anything suspicious around the park to call the anti-terrorism hotline , which they are also asking londoners to store in their mobile phones .

ms clark is seeking a third successive three-year term for her labour-led administration .
two months of campaigning are expected to focus on the economy , new zealand 's relations with washington , and the country 's 20-year non-nuclear policy .
recent opinion polls have put the main opposition national party slightly ahead of the ruling party .
ms clark called the elections just a week before she was obliged to set a date .
analysts say she was buying time in an attempt to reverse a swing against her in the polls .
the election will pit ms clark , who has criticised the us decision to go to war in iraq , against national party leader don brash who has pledged to mend ties with washington .
" our government took a principled decision not to support a war which was wrong , " ms clark told reporters a few days ago .
" national would have committed combat troops , and it would do so now given the chance . "
mr brash has also said that he could , in the future , review new zealand 's 1985 ban on nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered ships .
regarding the economy , mr brash has promised tax cuts if he wins power , whilst ms clark has promised to keep building on new zealand 's economic strength and to raise living standards .

this new design manages to be both the uk 's largest charity for deaf people and a design magazine are launching an exhibition of futuristic hearing aids to make them more popular .
the show , called hearwear , opens at the victoria & albert museum in london this week .
a variety of designs will be on display , ranging from stylish devices to enhance hearing to products that can be used by anyone to control sound .
the idea is to persuade people that hearwear can be as appealing as specs .
the show is a collaboration between the royal national institute for deaf people -lrb- rnid -rrb- , design magazine , blueprint , and creative agency wolff olins .
the ideas on display include a remote control to block out irritating sounds , a device to enable people to have a clear conversation in a noisy bar , and hearing aids designed as fashionable jewellery or must-have gadgets .
another concept , known as the goldfish , instantly replays the previous 10 seconds of sound to the wearer in case they have failed to catch someone 's name .
it is based on the idea that goldfish only have 10 seconds of memory .
missing millions the rnid believes that the number of people who have some hearing loss will rise from the current one in seven of the population as noise pollution increases and people live longer .
some of the new ideas from the hearwear exhibition , of which henrietta thompson is co-curator .
in pictures " this is likely to become one of the biggest health and social issues of our time , " said rnid chief executive john low .
" millions of people who could benefit from wearing a hearing aid or hearing protection are reluctant to do so . "
the charity is calling for a revolution in people 's thinking about hearing products and says that there is insufficient investment in the customer appeal of hearing aids .
" there has been an incredible revolution is the design of glasses , why not in hearing aids , " wonders dr low .
although the european market for hearing aids is worth £ 2.9bn , the concern is that millions of people who could benefit from them are reluctant to do so .
design journalist and blueprint deputy editor , henrietta thompson , has a hearing impairment and refused to wear hearing aids until she was 14 .
" too many people prefer to struggle to hear rather than wearing one , " she said .
" it 's ridiculous , today , when we 're surrounded by good design in all areas of our lives , that hearing aids have been forgotten in this way . "
" with hearwear we asked the designers how we might break out of this pattern and create stylish and useful products that people might actually want to wear , whether they are deaf or not . "

the show is a collaboration between the royal national institute for deaf people -lrb- rnid -rrb- , design magazine , blueprint , and creative agency wolff olins .
the ideas on display include a remote control to block out irritating sounds , a device to enable people to have a clear conversation in a noisy bar , and hearing aids designed as fashionable jewellery or must-have gadgets .
another concept , known as the goldfish , instantly replays the previous 10 seconds of sound to the wearer in case they have failed to catch someone 's name .

two of the 7 july bombers rode the rapids at canolfan tryweryn , the national whitewater centre , in bala , north wales weeks before the attack .
officers believe several people with links to addresses being investigated in relation to the 21 july attack may have also been on a trip at the centre .
but it is not yet clear whether they are the suspected bombers .
new intelligence earlier in the week it emerged that mohammad sidique khan and shehzad tanweer , who both carried out bombings in london on 7 july , attended a whitewater rafting trip on 4 june at canolfan tryweryn .
photographs showed khan , who carried out the edgware road bombing , raising a two-fingered peace sign , and tanweer , who bombed aldgate , leaning forward and appearing to laugh .
to think that these two groups have come here to plan their vile deeds in london does create great concern councillor elwyn edwards new intelligence received by detectives has suggested a possible link between the trip and those responsible for the attempted london bomb attack on 21 july , which targeted three london underground trains and one bus .
officers believe the trip was attended by several people with links to addresses that are " of interest " in relation to the bombing .
paul o 'sullivan , director of canolfan tryweryn , said they were " quite surprised " to find two potential links to the bombings .
suspects of failed bombings on 21 july are still at large " we get a lot of people here - 25,000 rafters .
we have no names , all we have been able to do is confirm to police that another group rafted on the same day who were of an asian / ethnic origin . "
bala councillor elwyn edwards said he hoped this development could help police .
" to think that these two groups have come here to plan their vile deeds in london does create great concern , " he said .
" if that is true , then the records will be here of the names of the second group as well as the first group .
i hope that is true and they catch them as soon as possible . "
earlier in the week , a spokesman for canolfan tryweryn said : " following liaison with the police , we are now able to confirm that customers with the names sidique khan and shehzad tanweer took part in a whitewater rafting trip on june 4 . "

two of the 7 july bombers rode the rapids at canolfan tryweryn , the national whitewater centre , in bala , north wales weeks before the attack .
officers believe several people with links to addresses being investigated in relation to the 21 july attack may have also been on a trip at the centre .
but it is not yet clear whether they are the suspected bombers .
new intelligence earlier in the week it emerged that mohammad sidique khan and shehzad tanweer , who both carried out bombings in london on 7 july , attended a whitewater rafting trip on 4 june at canolfan tryweryn .
photographs showed khan , who carried out the edgware road bombing , raising a two-fingered peace sign , and tanweer , who bombed aldgate , leaning forward and appearing to laugh .
to think that these two groups have come here to plan their vile deeds in london does create great concern councillor elwyn edwards new intelligence received by detectives has suggested a possible link between the trip and those responsible for the attempted london bomb attack on 21 july , which targeted three london underground trains and one bus .
officers believe the trip was attended by several people with links to addresses that are " of interest " in relation to the bombing .
paul o 'sullivan , director of canolfan tryweryn , said they were " quite surprised " to find two potential links to the bombings .
suspects of failed bombings on 21 july are still at large " we get a lot of people here - 25,000 rafters .
we have no names , all we have been able to do is confirm to police that another group rafted on the same day who were of an asian / ethnic origin . "
bala councillor elwyn edwards said he hoped this development could help police .
" to think that these two groups have come here to plan their vile deeds in london does create great concern , " he said .
" if that is true , then the records will be here of the names of the second group as well as the first group .
i hope that is true and they catch them as soon as possible . "
earlier in the week , a spokesman for canolfan tryweryn said : " following liaison with the police , we are now able to confirm that customers with the names sidique khan and shehzad tanweer took part in a whitewater rafting trip on june 4 . "
other people who are known to have visited the site include the manchester united football squad and deputy prime minister john prescott .

anglers found hundreds of dead salmon and sea trout on friday , and have blamed chemicals for the " disaster . "
the department of the environment said samples had been taken from several suspected sources of pollution .
there are fears the incident could be worse than a pollution spill in 1982 , which virtually wiped out the river 's salmon and sea trout population .
the doe 's water pollution team has been at the site of the fish kill since the discovery was made .
an aerator is in place to help prevent further loss of fish .
angler cathal mcguigan said he knew it was a major catastrophe as he was approaching the river bank .
he said : " i could see nothing but salmon dying and coming out of the water and lying in two to three inches of water to try to get oxygen .
we had something like this happen in 1982 and the whole river was wiped out at that time sean mccloskey roe anglers ' association " it would have took the heart out of a stone to see a salmon river desecrated . "
he said fish actually jumped out of the water to escape the pollution .
" a lot of the salmon that i saw were very white around the mouth .
there was one fish i saw .. and it was totally grey as if there was no skin , " he said .
july and august are traditionally the best months for angling on the river roe .
however , events of the past few days mean a very different scenario this year .
sean mccloskey , president of the roe anglers ' association , said a similar incident more than 20 years ago had almost decimated the fish population .
" words can not express how i feel about it , because we had something like this happen in 1982 and the whole river was wiped out at that time , " he said .
" we re-stocked it but the river has never recovered from that . "
' fish trapped ' anglers are convinced that some form of chemical is to blame for the fish deaths , but the situation is being exacerbated by a lack of rainfall .
mr mccloskey added : " if we had been lucky enough to have a big flood a fortnight ago or even a week ago , a lot of these -lrb- fish -rrb- would have been up above limavady and would have been reasonably safe .
" we still would have lost a lot of fish .
" i do n't know what we are going to lose now , because with very little flow in the river , that chemical , if it was a chemical , will go in and out with the tides .
it 's going to be there all the time .
" any fresh fish coming in will be trapped as well . "
cathal mcguigan , however , has a suggestion for how the river could be cleaned up .
" the only thing now is to open banagher dam and let it into the roe and let it wash it out , " he explained .
" this has got to be got on top of .
this is a major , major disaster . "

anglers found hundreds of dead salmon and sea trout on friday , and have blamed chemicals for the " disaster . "
the department of the environment said samples had been taken from several suspected sources of pollution .
there are fears the incident could be worse than a pollution spill in 1982 , which virtually wiped out the river 's salmon and sea trout population .
the doe 's water pollution team has been at the site of the fish kill since the discovery was made .
an aerator is in place to help prevent further loss of fish .
angler cathal mcguigan said he knew it was a major catastrophe as he was approaching the river bank .
he said : " i could see nothing but salmon dying and coming out of the water and lying in two to three inches of water to try to get oxygen .
we had something like this happen in 1982 and the whole river was wiped out at that time sean mccloskey roe anglers ' association " it would have took the heart out of a stone to see a salmon river desecrated . "
he said fish actually jumped out of the water to escape the pollution .
" a lot of the salmon that i saw were very white around the mouth .
there was one fish i saw .. and it was totally grey as if there was no skin , " he said .
july and august are traditionally the best months for angling on the river roe .
however , events of the past few days mean a very different scenario this year .
sean mccloskey , president of the roe anglers ' association , said a similar incident more than 20 years ago had almost decimated the fish population .
" words can not express how i feel about it , because we had something like this happen in 1982 and the whole river was wiped out at that time , " he said .
" we re-stocked it but the river has never recovered from that . "
' fish trapped ' anglers are convinced that some form of chemical is to blame for the fish deaths , but the situation is being exacerbated by a lack of rainfall .
mr mccloskey added : " if we had been lucky enough to have a big flood a fortnight ago or even a week ago , a lot of these -lrb- fish -rrb- would have been up above limavady and would have been reasonably safe .
" we still would have lost a lot of fish .
" i do n't know what we are going to lose now , because with very little flow in the river , that chemical , if it was a chemical , will go in and out with the tides .
