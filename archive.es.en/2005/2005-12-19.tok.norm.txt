the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .

the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .

" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .

he became a german citizen in 1996 . five years later , after receiving an official request from the slovak authorities , the german investigation into niznansky 's involvement began .
german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .
he added that there was no firm evidence that niznansky himself shot any of the victims in klak , ostry grun or ksina . defense attorney ufer had demanded niznansky be acquitted and asked for compensation for the time he has spent in prison , saying there was no evidence showing his guilt .
the defense claimed that without the evidence from the 1962 trial , the credibility of which is in doubt , the prosecution had nothing . " the prosecution has built its entire case on the 1962 trial in czechoslovakia and that was a communist show trial , " he said .
" the investigators were all members of the state security apparatus . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 scientists rebuild part of woolly mammoth 's genome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using miniscule bone fragments , scientists can trace the mammoth in a world first , german scientists say they have reconstructed a key sequence in the genome of the woolly mammoth , enabling them to show that the extinct beast 's closest modern relative is the asian elephant . reporting online sunday in nature , the british science journal , the researchers say they devised a new technique for the feat , teasing out dna from just 200 milligrams -lrb- 0.007 of an ounce -rrb- of bone found at a mammoths ' graveyard in the siberian permafrost . their technique , called multiplex polymerase chain reaction , copied 46 chunks of sequence , which were rearranged to give a picture of the creature 's mitochondrial dna . the mitochondria are an internal part of a cell that is the cell 's power supply .
mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .
the difference , though , is not great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scientists say the african elephant is a descendent of the woolly mammoth african elephants branched away from the mammoth 's evolutionary tree around six million years ago .
asian elephants followed suit around only 440,000 years later .
that timeline of divergence is intriguingly close to that of gorillas , chimps and humans in how they branched out from the primates ' family tree . the mammoth team was led by michael hofreiter of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig .
degraded samples previous efforts to recover pre-ice age species have run into the predictable problem of retrieving material that has not rotted after 10,000 years or more in the permafrost . until now , little more than 1,000 base pairs - the " letters " on the dna code which make up the chemical recipe for making and sustaining life - have been coaxed out of these frozen samples .
the previous maximum was 1,600 base pairs .
but by using their new approach to gently amplify the ancient dna , hofreiter 's team were able to get 5,000 base pairs , even though their sample , too , was degraded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drawing of a mammoth and a horse in a cave near combe d 'arc , france woolly mammoths once roamed far and wide across the northern reaches of eurasia and north america , but no trace of them survives beyond the end of the last ice age , some 11,000 years ago .
their heavy layers of fat , their long brown top hair and thick woolly undercoat were superb for bitter cold but left them ill-equipped for a warmer climate and the rise of homo sapiens . they are among the best-researched animals of the ice age , thanks to the preservation of carcasses in frozen ground and the pictures of the creatures made by stone age artists in european caves . the bone used in the latest research came from the banks of the berelekh river in yakutia , where thousands of bones , belonging to some 160 mammoths , have been recovered . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' curse of the iceman ' linked to scientist 's death the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior .

dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .

the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

the actor , writer , violinist and self-described " jester " recently celebrated three quarters of a century . müller-stahl has often had a reason to laugh because throughout in his circuitous life and ever-changing career , he has always managed to come out on top . born on dec .
17 , 1930 in the then-east prussian city of tilsit -lrb- now russia -rrb- , he was almost killed on may 1 , 1945 by a russian soldier - but a brave pole stopped the man .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

the actor , writer , violinist and self-described " jester " recently celebrated three quarters of a century . müller-stahl has often had a reason to laugh because throughout in his circuitous life and ever-changing career , he has always managed to come out on top . born on dec .
17 , 1930 in the then-east prussian city of tilsit -lrb- now russia -rrb- , he was almost killed on may 1 , 1945 by a russian soldier - but a brave pole stopped the man .
his father was not so lucky . growing up , müller-stahl wanted to be a famous violinist .
many long evenings , he publicly fiddled .
eventually , he began studying violin in berlin and became a noted concert violinist and teacher .
but after seeing " hamlet " in a berlin theater in 1950 , he decided to take up acting and made his debut in 1953 after breaking off his acting studies after a year because of a lack of ability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-stahl -lrb- pictured with the late sir peter ustinov -rrb- gained fame in the west after emigrating in 1980 regardless , he got acting engagements anyway .
he played a number of classical roles at berlin 's volksbühne , including brother martin in george bernard shaw 's st. joan and mercutio in shakespeare 's romeo and juliet .
soon after , he became one of the prolific and highest paid actors in the gdr - in theater and television - and the most loved . from stage to scree n in 1958 , he made an easy transition from stage to screen in " heimliche ehe -lrb- secret marriage -rrb- . "
in 1974 , he appeared in jakob der lügner -lrb- jacob the liar -rrb- , the only gdr film ever to receive a best foreign language film oscar nomination .
he won numerous distinctions including gdr television actor of the year in 1975 . in 1976 , he signed the biermann resolution , a manifesto critical of the government of the gdr .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .
her release ought , at the very least , to give us food for thought ; not least in these days leading up to christmas . peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .

he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .

public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .

the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '

the actor , writer , violinist and self-described " jester " recently celebrated three quarters of a century . müller-stahl has often had a reason to laugh because throughout in his circuitous life and ever-changing career , he has always managed to come out on top . born on dec .
17 , 1930 in the then-east prussian city of tilsit -lrb- now russia -rrb- , he was almost killed on may 1 , 1945 by a russian soldier - but a brave pole stopped the man .
his father was not so lucky . growing up , müller-stahl wanted to be a famous violinist .
many long evenings , he publicly fiddled .
eventually , he began studying violin in berlin and became a noted concert violinist and teacher .
but after seeing " hamlet " in a berlin theater in 1950 , he decided to take up acting and made his debut in 1953 after breaking off his acting studies after a year because of a lack of ability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-stahl -lrb- pictured with the late sir peter ustinov -rrb- gained fame in the west after emigrating in 1980 regardless , he got acting engagements anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.12.2005 budget deal hints at changing power structure in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair may claim credit for the deal but merkel kept all sides talking as crisis loomed the eu budget was saved by the bloc 's most powerful leaders .
that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .

the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .
21 , 1945 and that he selected an execution squad on feb .
7 , 1945 to murder 18 jews who had been discovered hiding in the village of ksina . defendant denies claims as " unimaginable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky maintains that a slovak would never have been in a position to give the orders at the villages he had vehemently refuted the accusations , denying ever being second-in-command of the edelweiss unit and that his only role was as translator for the unit 's leader , a german major .
" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .
niznansky sentenced to death in absentia in 1962 despite his claims of innocence in the massacres of 1945 , niznansky already has a conviction against him for the crimes for which he stands trial in germany .
he was convicted of the shootings and other killings by a court in what was communist czechoslovakia in 1962 .
he was sentenced to death in absentia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky was tried and convicted in absentia in 1963 at the time , niznansky was living in germany where he worked for us-financed radio free europe , which broadcast western programming to the soviet bloc .
he became a german citizen in 1996 . five years later , after receiving an official request from the slovak authorities , the german investigation into niznansky 's involvement began .
german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 corruption catches up with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in the shady world of business deals a report published this month by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 corruption catches up with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in the shady world of business deals a report published this month by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .

dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .
her release ought , at the very least , to give us food for thought ; not least in these days leading up to christmas . peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 nazi war crimes suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prosecution evidence was deemed to circumstantial to convict niznansky in a munich courtroom on monday ladislav niznansky , an 88-year-old slovak accused of nazi war crimes , was acquitted of involvement in the massacres of slovaks and jews in 1945 . a munich court has acquitted ladislav niznansky , an 88-year-old slovak accused of nazi war crimes . ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict niznansky of the crimes of which he was accused at the end of the 15-month trial , the court released him and ordered that the former slovak army captain be paid compensation for time spent in custody . the prosecution had been looking for a life sentence for niznansky for his alleged role in massacres of slovak civilians at the end of world war ii . as it became increasingly clear that the days of the third reich were numbered , many slovaks rose up against their country 's nazi puppet government in an attempt to precipitate its downfall .
the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .
21 , 1945 and that he selected an execution squad on feb .
7 , 1945 to murder 18 jews who had been discovered hiding in the village of ksina . defendant denies claims as " unimaginable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky maintains that a slovak would never have been in a position to give the orders at the villages he had vehemently refuted the accusations , denying ever being second-in-command of the edelweiss unit and that his only role was as translator for the unit 's leader , a german major .
" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .
niznansky sentenced to death in absentia in 1962 despite his claims of innocence in the massacres of 1945 , niznansky already has a conviction against him for the crimes for which he stands trial in germany .
he was convicted of the shootings and other killings by a court in what was communist czechoslovakia in 1962 .
he was sentenced to death in absentia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky was tried and convicted in absentia in 1963 at the time , niznansky was living in germany where he worked for us-financed radio free europe , which broadcast western programming to the soviet bloc .
he became a german citizen in 1996 . five years later , after receiving an official request from the slovak authorities , the german investigation into niznansky 's involvement began .
german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .
he added that there was no firm evidence that niznansky himself shot any of the victims in klak , ostry grun or ksina . defense attorney ufer had demanded niznansky be acquitted and asked for compensation for the time he has spent in prison , saying there was no evidence showing his guilt .
the defense claimed that without the evidence from the 1962 trial , the credibility of which is in doubt , the prosecution had nothing . " the prosecution has built its entire case on the 1962 trial in czechoslovakia and that was a communist show trial , " he said .
" the investigators were all members of the state security apparatus . "
ufer also said that at a follow-up trial of other edelweiss members in czechoslovakia in 1963 , " none of the defendants said that niznansky gave any liquidation orders .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

" osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 corruption catches up with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in the shady world of business deals a report published this month by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .

the actor , writer , violinist and self-described " jester " recently celebrated three quarters of a century . müller-stahl has often had a reason to laugh because throughout in his circuitous life and ever-changing career , he has always managed to come out on top . born on dec .
17 , 1930 in the then-east prussian city of tilsit -lrb- now russia -rrb- , he was almost killed on may 1 , 1945 by a russian soldier - but a brave pole stopped the man .
his father was not so lucky . growing up , müller-stahl wanted to be a famous violinist .
many long evenings , he publicly fiddled .
eventually , he began studying violin in berlin and became a noted concert violinist and teacher .
but after seeing " hamlet " in a berlin theater in 1950 , he decided to take up acting and made his debut in 1953 after breaking off his acting studies after a year because of a lack of ability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-stahl -lrb- pictured with the late sir peter ustinov -rrb- gained fame in the west after emigrating in 1980 regardless , he got acting engagements anyway .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .
her release ought , at the very least , to give us food for thought ; not least in these days leading up to christmas . peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

the actor , writer , violinist and self-described " jester " recently celebrated three quarters of a century . müller-stahl has often had a reason to laugh because throughout in his circuitous life and ever-changing career , he has always managed to come out on top . born on dec .
17 , 1930 in the then-east prussian city of tilsit -lrb- now russia -rrb- , he was almost killed on may 1 , 1945 by a russian soldier - but a brave pole stopped the man .
his father was not so lucky . growing up , müller-stahl wanted to be a famous violinist .
many long evenings , he publicly fiddled .
eventually , he began studying violin in berlin and became a noted concert violinist and teacher .
but after seeing " hamlet " in a berlin theater in 1950 , he decided to take up acting and made his debut in 1953 after breaking off his acting studies after a year because of a lack of ability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-stahl -lrb- pictured with the late sir peter ustinov -rrb- gained fame in the west after emigrating in 1980 regardless , he got acting engagements anyway .
he played a number of classical roles at berlin 's volksbühne , including brother martin in george bernard shaw 's st. joan and mercutio in shakespeare 's romeo and juliet .
soon after , he became one of the prolific and highest paid actors in the gdr - in theater and television - and the most loved . from stage to scree n in 1958 , he made an easy transition from stage to screen in " heimliche ehe -lrb- secret marriage -rrb- . "
in 1974 , he appeared in jakob der lügner -lrb- jacob the liar -rrb- , the only gdr film ever to receive a best foreign language film oscar nomination .
he won numerous distinctions including gdr television actor of the year in 1975 . in 1976 , he signed the biermann resolution , a manifesto critical of the government of the gdr .
this led to his blacklisting .
müller-stahl spent his time writing a memoir , " ordered sunday , " and painting before the government allowed him to emigrate to west germany in 1980 . afterwards , he rose to fame in europe with rainer werner fassbinder 's " lola " and " veronica voss " and also worked with other famous directors such as andrzej wajda -lrb- " love in germany " -rrb- , istvan szabo -lrb- " colonel redl " -rrb- and agnieszka holland -lrb- " angry harvest " -rrb- . he began to grow more famous in the us after being cast in " music box " in 1989 and " avalon " a year later .
after numerous parts , he won an oscar nomination for his role as the father of pianist david helfgott in " shine " in 1996 . other roles include " conversations with the beast " -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , " the peacemaker , " the game " and " the assistant . "
he has also appeared on television , in made for tv movies and in guest appearances on " the west wing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 opinion : germany can learn from osthoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff became a victim of the war which germany refuses to fight on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .
dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .
her release ought , at the very least , to give us food for thought ; not least in these days leading up to christmas . peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .

" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .

the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .

but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

the actor , writer , violinist and self-described " jester " recently celebrated three quarters of a century . müller-stahl has often had a reason to laugh because throughout in his circuitous life and ever-changing career , he has always managed to come out on top . born on dec .
17 , 1930 in the then-east prussian city of tilsit -lrb- now russia -rrb- , he was almost killed on may 1 , 1945 by a russian soldier - but a brave pole stopped the man .
his father was not so lucky . growing up , müller-stahl wanted to be a famous violinist .
many long evenings , he publicly fiddled .
eventually , he began studying violin in berlin and became a noted concert violinist and teacher .
but after seeing " hamlet " in a berlin theater in 1950 , he decided to take up acting and made his debut in 1953 after breaking off his acting studies after a year because of a lack of ability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-stahl -lrb- pictured with the late sir peter ustinov -rrb- gained fame in the west after emigrating in 1980 regardless , he got acting engagements anyway .
he played a number of classical roles at berlin 's volksbühne , including brother martin in george bernard shaw 's st. joan and mercutio in shakespeare 's romeo and juliet .
soon after , he became one of the prolific and highest paid actors in the gdr - in theater and television - and the most loved . from stage to scree n in 1958 , he made an easy transition from stage to screen in " heimliche ehe -lrb- secret marriage -rrb- . "
in 1974 , he appeared in jakob der lügner -lrb- jacob the liar -rrb- , the only gdr film ever to receive a best foreign language film oscar nomination .
he won numerous distinctions including gdr television actor of the year in 1975 . in 1976 , he signed the biermann resolution , a manifesto critical of the government of the gdr .
this led to his blacklisting .
müller-stahl spent his time writing a memoir , " ordered sunday , " and painting before the government allowed him to emigrate to west germany in 1980 . afterwards , he rose to fame in europe with rainer werner fassbinder 's " lola " and " veronica voss " and also worked with other famous directors such as andrzej wajda -lrb- " love in germany " -rrb- , istvan szabo -lrb- " colonel redl " -rrb- and agnieszka holland -lrb- " angry harvest " -rrb- . he began to grow more famous in the us after being cast in " music box " in 1989 and " avalon " a year later .
after numerous parts , he won an oscar nomination for his role as the father of pianist david helfgott in " shine " in 1996 . other roles include " conversations with the beast " -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , " the peacemaker , " the game " and " the assistant . "

the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .
21 , 1945 and that he selected an execution squad on feb .
7 , 1945 to murder 18 jews who had been discovered hiding in the village of ksina . defendant denies claims as " unimaginable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky maintains that a slovak would never have been in a position to give the orders at the villages he had vehemently refuted the accusations , denying ever being second-in-command of the edelweiss unit and that his only role was as translator for the unit 's leader , a german major .
" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .
niznansky sentenced to death in absentia in 1962 despite his claims of innocence in the massacres of 1945 , niznansky already has a conviction against him for the crimes for which he stands trial in germany .
he was convicted of the shootings and other killings by a court in what was communist czechoslovakia in 1962 .
he was sentenced to death in absentia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky was tried and convicted in absentia in 1963 at the time , niznansky was living in germany where he worked for us-financed radio free europe , which broadcast western programming to the soviet bloc .
he became a german citizen in 1996 . five years later , after receiving an official request from the slovak authorities , the german investigation into niznansky 's involvement began .
german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .
he added that there was no firm evidence that niznansky himself shot any of the victims in klak , ostry grun or ksina . defense attorney ufer had demanded niznansky be acquitted and asked for compensation for the time he has spent in prison , saying there was no evidence showing his guilt .
the defense claimed that without the evidence from the 1962 trial , the credibility of which is in doubt , the prosecution had nothing . " the prosecution has built its entire case on the 1962 trial in czechoslovakia and that was a communist show trial , " he said .
" the investigators were all members of the state security apparatus . "
ufer also said that at a follow-up trial of other edelweiss members in czechoslovakia in 1963 , " none of the defendants said that niznansky gave any liquidation orders .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .
21 , 1945 and that he selected an execution squad on feb .
7 , 1945 to murder 18 jews who had been discovered hiding in the village of ksina . defendant denies claims as " unimaginable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky maintains that a slovak would never have been in a position to give the orders at the villages he had vehemently refuted the accusations , denying ever being second-in-command of the edelweiss unit and that his only role was as translator for the unit 's leader , a german major .
" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .
niznansky sentenced to death in absentia in 1962 despite his claims of innocence in the massacres of 1945 , niznansky already has a conviction against him for the crimes for which he stands trial in germany .
he was convicted of the shootings and other killings by a court in what was communist czechoslovakia in 1962 .
he was sentenced to death in absentia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky was tried and convicted in absentia in 1963 at the time , niznansky was living in germany where he worked for us-financed radio free europe , which broadcast western programming to the soviet bloc .
he became a german citizen in 1996 . five years later , after receiving an official request from the slovak authorities , the german investigation into niznansky 's involvement began .
german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .
he added that there was no firm evidence that niznansky himself shot any of the victims in klak , ostry grun or ksina . defense attorney ufer had demanded niznansky be acquitted and asked for compensation for the time he has spent in prison , saying there was no evidence showing his guilt .
the defense claimed that without the evidence from the 1962 trial , the credibility of which is in doubt , the prosecution had nothing . " the prosecution has built its entire case on the 1962 trial in czechoslovakia and that was a communist show trial , " he said .
" the investigators were all members of the state security apparatus . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 opinion : germany can learn from osthoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff became a victim of the war which germany refuses to fight on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .
dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .
her release ought , at the very least , to give us food for thought ; not least in these days leading up to christmas . peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 corruption catches up with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in the shady world of business deals a report published this month by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid .

the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .

" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .

german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .
he added that there was no firm evidence that niznansky himself shot any of the victims in klak , ostry grun or ksina . defense attorney ufer had demanded niznansky be acquitted and asked for compensation for the time he has spent in prison , saying there was no evidence showing his guilt .
the defense claimed that without the evidence from the 1962 trial , the credibility of which is in doubt , the prosecution had nothing . " the prosecution has built its entire case on the 1962 trial in czechoslovakia and that was a communist show trial , " he said .
" the investigators were all members of the state security apparatus . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 nazi war crimes suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prosecution evidence was deemed to circumstantial to convict niznansky in a munich courtroom on monday ladislav niznansky , an 88-year-old slovak accused of nazi war crimes , was acquitted of involvement in the massacres of slovaks and jews in 1945 . a munich court has acquitted ladislav niznansky , an 88-year-old slovak accused of nazi war crimes . ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict niznansky of the crimes of which he was accused at the end of the 15-month trial , the court released him and ordered that the former slovak army captain be paid compensation for time spent in custody . the prosecution had been looking for a life sentence for niznansky for his alleged role in massacres of slovak civilians at the end of world war ii . as it became increasingly clear that the days of the third reich were numbered , many slovaks rose up against their country 's nazi puppet government in an attempt to precipitate its downfall .
the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .
21 , 1945 and that he selected an execution squad on feb .
7 , 1945 to murder 18 jews who had been discovered hiding in the village of ksina . defendant denies claims as " unimaginable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky maintains that a slovak would never have been in a position to give the orders at the villages he had vehemently refuted the accusations , denying ever being second-in-command of the edelweiss unit and that his only role was as translator for the unit 's leader , a german major .
" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .
niznansky sentenced to death in absentia in 1962 despite his claims of innocence in the massacres of 1945 , niznansky already has a conviction against him for the crimes for which he stands trial in germany .
he was convicted of the shootings and other killings by a court in what was communist czechoslovakia in 1962 .
he was sentenced to death in absentia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky was tried and convicted in absentia in 1963 at the time , niznansky was living in germany where he worked for us-financed radio free europe , which broadcast western programming to the soviet bloc .
he became a german citizen in 1996 . five years later , after receiving an official request from the slovak authorities , the german investigation into niznansky 's involvement began .
german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 nazi war crimes suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prosecution evidence was deemed to circumstantial to convict niznansky in a munich courtroom on monday ladislav niznansky , an 88-year-old slovak accused of nazi war crimes , was acquitted of involvement in the massacres of slovaks and jews in 1945 . a munich court has acquitted ladislav niznansky , an 88-year-old slovak accused of nazi war crimes . ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict niznansky of the crimes of which he was accused at the end of the 15-month trial , the court released him and ordered that the former slovak army captain be paid compensation for time spent in custody . the prosecution had been looking for a life sentence for niznansky for his alleged role in massacres of slovak civilians at the end of world war ii . as it became increasingly clear that the days of the third reich were numbered , many slovaks rose up against their country 's nazi puppet government in an attempt to precipitate its downfall .
the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .
21 , 1945 and that he selected an execution squad on feb .
7 , 1945 to murder 18 jews who had been discovered hiding in the village of ksina . defendant denies claims as " unimaginable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky maintains that a slovak would never have been in a position to give the orders at the villages he had vehemently refuted the accusations , denying ever being second-in-command of the edelweiss unit and that his only role was as translator for the unit 's leader , a german major .
" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .
niznansky sentenced to death in absentia in 1962 despite his claims of innocence in the massacres of 1945 , niznansky already has a conviction against him for the crimes for which he stands trial in germany .
he was convicted of the shootings and other killings by a court in what was communist czechoslovakia in 1962 .
he was sentenced to death in absentia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky was tried and convicted in absentia in 1963 at the time , niznansky was living in germany where he worked for us-financed radio free europe , which broadcast western programming to the soviet bloc .
he became a german citizen in 1996 . five years later , after receiving an official request from the slovak authorities , the german investigation into niznansky 's involvement began .
german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .
he added that there was no firm evidence that niznansky himself shot any of the victims in klak , ostry grun or ksina . defense attorney ufer had demanded niznansky be acquitted and asked for compensation for the time he has spent in prison , saying there was no evidence showing his guilt .
the defense claimed that without the evidence from the 1962 trial , the credibility of which is in doubt , the prosecution had nothing . " the prosecution has built its entire case on the 1962 trial in czechoslovakia and that was a communist show trial , " he said .
" the investigators were all members of the state security apparatus . "
ufer also said that at a follow-up trial of other edelweiss members in czechoslovakia in 1963 , " none of the defendants said that niznansky gave any liquidation orders .

many long evenings , he publicly fiddled .
eventually , he began studying violin in berlin and became a noted concert violinist and teacher .
but after seeing " hamlet " in a berlin theater in 1950 , he decided to take up acting and made his debut in 1953 after breaking off his acting studies after a year because of a lack of ability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-stahl -lrb- pictured with the late sir peter ustinov -rrb- gained fame in the west after emigrating in 1980 regardless , he got acting engagements anyway .

he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 scientists rebuild part of woolly mammoth 's genome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using miniscule bone fragments , scientists can trace the mammoth in a world first , german scientists say they have reconstructed a key sequence in the genome of the woolly mammoth , enabling them to show that the extinct beast 's closest modern relative is the asian elephant . reporting online sunday in nature , the british science journal , the researchers say they devised a new technique for the feat , teasing out dna from just 200 milligrams -lrb- 0.007 of an ounce -rrb- of bone found at a mammoths ' graveyard in the siberian permafrost . their technique , called multiplex polymerase chain reaction , copied 46 chunks of sequence , which were rearranged to give a picture of the creature 's mitochondrial dna . the mitochondria are an internal part of a cell that is the cell 's power supply .
mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .
the difference , though , is not great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scientists say the african elephant is a descendent of the woolly mammoth african elephants branched away from the mammoth 's evolutionary tree around six million years ago .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 corruption catches up with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in the shady world of business deals a report published this month by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 corruption catches up with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in the shady world of business deals a report published this month by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 opinion : germany can learn from osthoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff became a victim of the war which germany refuses to fight on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .
dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .

dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .
the difference , though , is not great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scientists say the african elephant is a descendent of the woolly mammoth african elephants branched away from the mammoth 's evolutionary tree around six million years ago .
asian elephants followed suit around only 440,000 years later .
that timeline of divergence is intriguingly close to that of gorillas , chimps and humans in how they branched out from the primates ' family tree . the mammoth team was led by michael hofreiter of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig .
degraded samples previous efforts to recover pre-ice age species have run into the predictable problem of retrieving material that has not rotted after 10,000 years or more in the permafrost . until now , little more than 1,000 base pairs - the " letters " on the dna code which make up the chemical recipe for making and sustaining life - have been coaxed out of these frozen samples .
the previous maximum was 1,600 base pairs .
but by using their new approach to gently amplify the ancient dna , hofreiter 's team were able to get 5,000 base pairs , even though their sample , too , was degraded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drawing of a mammoth and a horse in a cave near combe d 'arc , france woolly mammoths once roamed far and wide across the northern reaches of eurasia and north america , but no trace of them survives beyond the end of the last ice age , some 11,000 years ago .
their heavy layers of fat , their long brown top hair and thick woolly undercoat were superb for bitter cold but left them ill-equipped for a warmer climate and the rise of homo sapiens . they are among the best-researched animals of the ice age , thanks to the preservation of carcasses in frozen ground and the pictures of the creatures made by stone age artists in european caves . the bone used in the latest research came from the banks of the berelekh river in yakutia , where thousands of bones , belonging to some 160 mammoths , have been recovered . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' curse of the iceman ' linked to scientist 's death the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior .

public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .
the difference , though , is not great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scientists say the african elephant is a descendent of the woolly mammoth african elephants branched away from the mammoth 's evolutionary tree around six million years ago .
asian elephants followed suit around only 440,000 years later .
that timeline of divergence is intriguingly close to that of gorillas , chimps and humans in how they branched out from the primates ' family tree . the mammoth team was led by michael hofreiter of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig .
degraded samples previous efforts to recover pre-ice age species have run into the predictable problem of retrieving material that has not rotted after 10,000 years or more in the permafrost . until now , little more than 1,000 base pairs - the " letters " on the dna code which make up the chemical recipe for making and sustaining life - have been coaxed out of these frozen samples .
the previous maximum was 1,600 base pairs .
but by using their new approach to gently amplify the ancient dna , hofreiter 's team were able to get 5,000 base pairs , even though their sample , too , was degraded .

their heavy layers of fat , their long brown top hair and thick woolly undercoat were superb for bitter cold but left them ill-equipped for a warmer climate and the rise of homo sapiens . they are among the best-researched animals of the ice age , thanks to the preservation of carcasses in frozen ground and the pictures of the creatures made by stone age artists in european caves . the bone used in the latest research came from the banks of the berelekh river in yakutia , where thousands of bones , belonging to some 160 mammoths , have been recovered . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' curse of the iceman ' linked to scientist 's death the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 nazi war crimes suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prosecution evidence was deemed to circumstantial to convict niznansky in a munich courtroom on monday ladislav niznansky , an 88-year-old slovak accused of nazi war crimes , was acquitted of involvement in the massacres of slovaks and jews in 1945 . a munich court has acquitted ladislav niznansky , an 88-year-old slovak accused of nazi war crimes . ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict niznansky of the crimes of which he was accused at the end of the 15-month trial , the court released him and ordered that the former slovak army captain be paid compensation for time spent in custody . the prosecution had been looking for a life sentence for niznansky for his alleged role in massacres of slovak civilians at the end of world war ii . as it became increasingly clear that the days of the third reich were numbered , many slovaks rose up against their country 's nazi puppet government in an attempt to precipitate its downfall .
the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .
21 , 1945 and that he selected an execution squad on feb .
7 , 1945 to murder 18 jews who had been discovered hiding in the village of ksina . defendant denies claims as " unimaginable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky maintains that a slovak would never have been in a position to give the orders at the villages he had vehemently refuted the accusations , denying ever being second-in-command of the edelweiss unit and that his only role was as translator for the unit 's leader , a german major .
" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .
niznansky sentenced to death in absentia in 1962 despite his claims of innocence in the massacres of 1945 , niznansky already has a conviction against him for the crimes for which he stands trial in germany .
he was convicted of the shootings and other killings by a court in what was communist czechoslovakia in 1962 .
he was sentenced to death in absentia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niznansky was tried and convicted in absentia in 1963 at the time , niznansky was living in germany where he worked for us-financed radio free europe , which broadcast western programming to the soviet bloc .
he became a german citizen in 1996 . five years later , after receiving an official request from the slovak authorities , the german investigation into niznansky 's involvement began .
german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .
he added that there was no firm evidence that niznansky himself shot any of the victims in klak , ostry grun or ksina . defense attorney ufer had demanded niznansky be acquitted and asked for compensation for the time he has spent in prison , saying there was no evidence showing his guilt .
the defense claimed that without the evidence from the 1962 trial , the credibility of which is in doubt , the prosecution had nothing . " the prosecution has built its entire case on the 1962 trial in czechoslovakia and that was a communist show trial , " he said .
" the investigators were all members of the state security apparatus . "
ufer also said that at a follow-up trial of other edelweiss members in czechoslovakia in 1963 , " none of the defendants said that niznansky gave any liquidation orders .

" driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .

at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .

the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .

" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .

german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .
he added that there was no firm evidence that niznansky himself shot any of the victims in klak , ostry grun or ksina . defense attorney ufer had demanded niznansky be acquitted and asked for compensation for the time he has spent in prison , saying there was no evidence showing his guilt .
the defense claimed that without the evidence from the 1962 trial , the credibility of which is in doubt , the prosecution had nothing . " the prosecution has built its entire case on the 1962 trial in czechoslovakia and that was a communist show trial , " he said .

the uprising was brutally crushed . rebel-turned-nazi commander accused of murder originally on the side of his own people , niznansky was captured by the nazis and then turned against his fellow slovaks to avoid being sent to a concentration camp .
he then took charge of the slovak section of a nazi unit code-named edelweiss that hunted resistance fighters and jews . according to the prosecution , on one occasion during the uprising , edelweiss , working with a unit of the elite ss and another unit that included german soldiers and ethnic german irregulars , surrounded the village of klak .
without determining whether resistance fighters were in the village at the time , the soldiers massacred the inhabitants , including women and small children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edelweiss and ss troops utterly destroyed the villages after the massacre " it is the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office that the accused gave a liquidation order at klak and ostry grun , " prosecutor konstantin kuchenbacher told the court in his summing up .
" he had arranged for these places to be surrounded so that nobody could escape .
the massacre was then carried out as a communal action , carried out by a number of different troop units . " niznansky stands accused of 164 counts of murder for the massacre at klak and at ostry grun , a neighboring village , on jan .

" it is unimaginable that that a slovak officer could have had a command role over a german unit , " the defendant told the associated press outside the courtroom last week . he did , however , admit to being present during the capture of us agents and associated press correspondent joseph morton , in slovakia in 1944 .
the agents and morton , the only war correspondent known to have been executed by any side during world war ii , were later killed . after the war , niznansky was sent to vienna to spy for the communist authorities and then became a double-agent for us intelligence , according to defense attorney steffen ufer .
niznansky sentenced to death in absentia in 1962 despite his claims of innocence in the massacres of 1945 , niznansky already has a conviction against him for the crimes for which he stands trial in germany .
he was convicted of the shootings and other killings by a court in what was communist czechoslovakia in 1962 .

he became a german citizen in 1996 . five years later , after receiving an official request from the slovak authorities , the german investigation into niznansky 's involvement began .
german judges traveled to slovakia and austria to interview surviving witnesses . he was taken into custody but released by the court in october 2004 , after testimony from a former edelweiss member - whose evidence helped secure his 1962 conviction - was ruled as contradictory . contradictory 1962 testimony could prove crucial despite using some of the statements from the 1962 trial in his case , prosecuting counsel kuchenbauer later admitted that several elderly witnesses invited to munich had denied their 1962 testimony .
he added that there was no firm evidence that niznansky himself shot any of the victims in klak , ostry grun or ksina . defense attorney ufer had demanded niznansky be acquitted and asked for compensation for the time he has spent in prison , saying there was no evidence showing his guilt .
the defense claimed that without the evidence from the 1962 trial , the credibility of which is in doubt , the prosecution had nothing . " the prosecution has built its entire case on the 1962 trial in czechoslovakia and that was a communist show trial , " he said .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .

whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .
the difference , though , is not great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scientists say the african elephant is a descendent of the woolly mammoth african elephants branched away from the mammoth 's evolutionary tree around six million years ago .
asian elephants followed suit around only 440,000 years later .
that timeline of divergence is intriguingly close to that of gorillas , chimps and humans in how they branched out from the primates ' family tree . the mammoth team was led by michael hofreiter of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig .
degraded samples previous efforts to recover pre-ice age species have run into the predictable problem of retrieving material that has not rotted after 10,000 years or more in the permafrost . until now , little more than 1,000 base pairs - the " letters " on the dna code which make up the chemical recipe for making and sustaining life - have been coaxed out of these frozen samples .
the previous maximum was 1,600 base pairs .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .
the difference , though , is not great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scientists say the african elephant is a descendent of the woolly mammoth african elephants branched away from the mammoth 's evolutionary tree around six million years ago .
asian elephants followed suit around only 440,000 years later .
that timeline of divergence is intriguingly close to that of gorillas , chimps and humans in how they branched out from the primates ' family tree . the mammoth team was led by michael hofreiter of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig .
degraded samples previous efforts to recover pre-ice age species have run into the predictable problem of retrieving material that has not rotted after 10,000 years or more in the permafrost . until now , little more than 1,000 base pairs - the " letters " on the dna code which make up the chemical recipe for making and sustaining life - have been coaxed out of these frozen samples .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly . " without wanting to prejudge the positions which will be taken by the european parliament , i note that the position of the council -lrb- of eu leaders -rrb- is very far from that of the european parliament , " he said in a statement . the parliament has previously set the bar at 883 billion euros , while the eu 's executive arm , the european commission , wants a robust budget to pay for the bloc 's ambitious programs and has called for 943 billion euros . the budget has to be agreed between the institutions , and borrell 's remarks signal that the assembly , which rarely flexes its political muscle and has tended to back down in the past , could be ready to stand firm on its proposal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes her mark as mediator in eu budget deal german chancellor angela merkel appears to have been one of the chief reasons the eu managed to agree on a budget deal during two days of haggling at a brussels summit .

" at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly .

dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .
her release ought , at the very least , to give us food for thought ; not least in these days leading up to christmas . peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 corruption catches up with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in the shady world of business deals a report published this month by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 corruption catches up with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in the shady world of business deals a report published this month by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated .

" even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 corruption catches up with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talks in the shady world of business deals a report published this month by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .

the actor , writer , violinist and self-described " jester " recently celebrated three quarters of a century . müller-stahl has often had a reason to laugh because throughout in his circuitous life and ever-changing career , he has always managed to come out on top . born on dec .
17 , 1930 in the then-east prussian city of tilsit -lrb- now russia -rrb- , he was almost killed on may 1 , 1945 by a russian soldier - but a brave pole stopped the man .
his father was not so lucky . growing up , müller-stahl wanted to be a famous violinist .
many long evenings , he publicly fiddled .
eventually , he began studying violin in berlin and became a noted concert violinist and teacher .
but after seeing " hamlet " in a berlin theater in 1950 , he decided to take up acting and made his debut in 1953 after breaking off his acting studies after a year because of a lack of ability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-stahl -lrb- pictured with the late sir peter ustinov -rrb- gained fame in the west after emigrating in 1980 regardless , he got acting engagements anyway .
he played a number of classical roles at berlin 's volksbühne , including brother martin in george bernard shaw 's st. joan and mercutio in shakespeare 's romeo and juliet .
soon after , he became one of the prolific and highest paid actors in the gdr - in theater and television - and the most loved . from stage to scree n in 1958 , he made an easy transition from stage to screen in " heimliche ehe -lrb- secret marriage -rrb- . "
in 1974 , he appeared in jakob der lügner -lrb- jacob the liar -rrb- , the only gdr film ever to receive a best foreign language film oscar nomination .
he won numerous distinctions including gdr television actor of the year in 1975 . in 1976 , he signed the biermann resolution , a manifesto critical of the government of the gdr .
this led to his blacklisting .
müller-stahl spent his time writing a memoir , " ordered sunday , " and painting before the government allowed him to emigrate to west germany in 1980 . afterwards , he rose to fame in europe with rainer werner fassbinder 's " lola " and " veronica voss " and also worked with other famous directors such as andrzej wajda -lrb- " love in germany " -rrb- , istvan szabo -lrb- " colonel redl " -rrb- and agnieszka holland -lrb- " angry harvest " -rrb- . he began to grow more famous in the us after being cast in " music box " in 1989 and " avalon " a year later .
after numerous parts , he won an oscar nomination for his role as the father of pianist david helfgott in " shine " in 1996 . other roles include " conversations with the beast " -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , " the peacemaker , " the game " and " the assistant . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2005 opinion : germany can learn from osthoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff became a victim of the war which germany refuses to fight on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .
dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .
her release ought , at the very least , to give us food for thought ; not least in these days leading up to christmas . peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .
the difference , though , is not great .

asian elephants followed suit around only 440,000 years later .
that timeline of divergence is intriguingly close to that of gorillas , chimps and humans in how they branched out from the primates ' family tree . the mammoth team was led by michael hofreiter of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig .
degraded samples previous efforts to recover pre-ice age species have run into the predictable problem of retrieving material that has not rotted after 10,000 years or more in the permafrost . until now , little more than 1,000 base pairs - the " letters " on the dna code which make up the chemical recipe for making and sustaining life - have been coaxed out of these frozen samples .
the previous maximum was 1,600 base pairs .
but by using their new approach to gently amplify the ancient dna , hofreiter 's team were able to get 5,000 base pairs , even though their sample , too , was degraded .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .
the difference , though , is not great .

asian elephants followed suit around only 440,000 years later .
that timeline of divergence is intriguingly close to that of gorillas , chimps and humans in how they branched out from the primates ' family tree . the mammoth team was led by michael hofreiter of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig .

dw 's peter philipp comments . while the worry about susanne osthoff is over , there are still many unanswered questions regarding her release , and indeed her capture .
it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .
her release ought , at the very least , to give us food for thought ; not least in these days leading up to christmas . peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

it is conceivable , that in the name of protecting her abductors , who after three weeks had a change of heart , those details will remain sketchy . among the little we do know is that her kidnappers were neither following political nor financial motives , but held the german archaeologist because they believed her to be a spy .
whatever the reason , and perhaps the finer points of the thinking behind her capture are not of prime importance right now , there is no justification for kidnapping and threatening civilians . her liberation is a relief for all those who spoke out for the headstrong young woman , as it is for the german government , which in spite of its resistance to military involvement in iraq , suddenly became a target .
it was an echo of the situation in which france , which vocally shared berlin 's opposition to the iraq war , found itself in with the kidnapping of french nationals - most of them journalists - in iraq . osthoff as a source of pride it all goes to show that nobody is immune to terrorism , its most fundamental characteristic being to randomly strike at innocent targets .
the basic principle is to terrorize the world at large and prevent civilians from being able to lead a normal life . susanne osthoff is one of a handful of foreigners in iraq not to be scared off by such dangers .
some claim she must be possessed , others say her determination displays a deep human commitment . whatever osthoff 's motivation , there are not enough people like her .
apart from the military , the majority of foreigners in mesopotamia are profiteers and opportunists who are there for their personal gain rather than out of a sense of wishing to improve the lot of the iraqi people . we should be proud of the few upstanding citizens , such as susanne osthoff , who try to break the rules and make a difference for iraqi nationals .
but such a stance appears rare in germany , which unlike france or italy failed to stage any mass demonstrations in the name of securing the release of a compatriot .
christmas markets , it seemed , were of greater importance . this episode should teach us that it is not enough to vote against a war ; we have to take care of the victims .
susanne osthoff did that , and thus became a victim herself .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly .

it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .
if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .
the british treasury would lose around 500 million pounds in 2009 , rising to two billion annually for 2011 to 2013 . president jacques chirac of france is likely to be another leader who will go back to his people with hopes of using the summit result to off-set his domestic problems . chirac hopes for prestige after " victory " over blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac will claim triumph over blair and britain 's coveted budget rebate it 's been a tough year for chirac with political failures , ill-health and plunging public popularity dogging him through 2005 but he will certainly use the perceived " victory " over tony blair to bring some much-needed gloss to his image at home . chirac , who had led the assault on the rebate , managed to fend off blair 's counter-attack on eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers benefit .
those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world . " while blair and chirac may continue to perpetuate their own images as the most important leaders in the eu , at least until either or both step down or are removed , german chancellor angela merkel looks well armed to take over the eu driving seat should it become vacant . germa n cha n cellor forgoes gra n dsta n di n g for hard work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " impressive ... cool , calm and professional " angela merkel merkel - a newcomer on the eu summit scene - quietly emerged as a key mediator in the diplomatic hurly-burly , shuttling between blair and chirac , the two main protagonists in thrashing out the eu 's future budget .
it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive . " at home , however , merkel already faced first criticism from the premiers of eastern german states who are worried that they will lose eu subsidies as a result of the deal . but despite all the signs that europe has got it right for once , there is still much to suggest it is fractious as ever . budget deal may be a false daw n as more rejectio n looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borell fontelles predicted more budget strife when the deal heads to parliament european parliament head josep borrell fontelles criticized the deal , raising the specter of a showdown at the eu assembly .

if he does , it may not be a role welcomed by his audience , especially when news that britain made a bigger concession on its budget rebate than publicly admitted becomes common knowledge . when announcing the 10.5 billion euros rebate cut , blair said britain will be losing around one billion pounds -lrb- 1.47 billion euros -rrb- a year over the budget period .
according to the fi n a n cial times on monday , britain will be losing two billion pounds a year by 2011 . an analysis of the detail in the budget agreement showed the rebate would be untouched in 2007 and 2008 , with the loss being " compressed " into the years between 2009 and 2013 , the paper said .

those subsidies - which account for a third of eu spending - will remain ; though will be subject to a later review . in a rare address broadcast on radio and television saturday , chirac called the budget accord " a good agreement " and sought to keep the momentum up by saying europe " must go on to the next phase ... we must have more democratic and more efficient eu bodies . " he added that " i will have the opportunity to make ambitious proposals for tomorrow 's europe which should be political , socially just and show solidarity ... so that it can become one of the main players in tomorrow 's world .

it was a measure of her success that the deal eventually clinched by blair was for precisely the spending limit merkel had proposed . merkel 's key mediation was to set the budget at halfway between the british offer and a luxembourg version acrimoniously rejected at a summit in june .
the figure corresponds to 862.4 billion euros , and germany will remain the biggest net contributor although not by as much as if the luxembourg proposal had been maintained . appreciative leaders heaped praise on the chancellor with austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel calling merkel " cool , calm and very professional " while luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker referred to her debut performance at a european summit as " very impressive .

that 's what tony blair and jacques chirac would have europe believe .
but while the deal does not fully cover the cracks , it hints at a possible shift in power . european union leaders can breathe a collective sigh of relief after clinching a last-minute budget deal at the weekend . the main story of the summit maybe one of an averted crisis but its subtext tells a more important tale of possible shifts in influence .
it involves those who can truly bask in the glory of their achievements and those who will publicly claim victory while secretly licking their wounds as they retreat from europe 's latest political battlefield . the 25-nation bloc hammered out its plans for the 2007-2013 spending period after a two-day marathon summit haggle which was ended by british prime minister tony blair brokering the eu funding accord in the early hours of saturday morning . blair finally broke the deadlock after offering a 10.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- cut from britain 's cherished eu rebate in return for a vow to review the whole budget , notably the key thorny issue of farm aid . " this is an agreement that allows europe to move forward , " blair told a press conference .
" if we 'd failed to reach an agreement at all ...
europe would have been in a very severe crisis . " the prime minister was effectively saying that britain had led the eu away from such a crisis while using the relief of a summit saved to deflect the fact that the near-crisis was one of britain 's own design . blair retur n s with a deal but also a fi n a n cial headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's budget will cut cost its government more than blair admitted whether blair returns home to play the savior of the european union remains to be seen .

" - relief and gratitude in germany following osthoff 's release germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .
but details of the release are still shrouded in mystery . germany heaved a sigh of relief following news of the release of susanne osthoff , a 43-year-old german archaeologist and aid worker , in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity . osthoff 's sister anja last week complained over a lack of public support for her sister , whose plight initially failed to ignite the same emotional response among germans as was seen in countries like france and italy which have also had nationals taken hostage in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in capitivity but as the saga continued , public support for osthoff has grown and her release was greeted with joy on sunday . " it is the best news of the christmas season .
she is alive , she is free , she is in good health , " the tabloid bild newspaper said . deputy government spokesman thomas steg said chancellor angela merkel was " very relieved that this hostage drama came to a happy ending . " driver 's whereabouts unclear reports said that osthoff was n't planning to come to germany right away . " osthoff wishes to spend several days with her daughter but she has indicated that she will leave iraq in the near future , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference monday . osthoff has a 12-year-old daughter from a failed marriage to an iraqi .
she had been doing aid work in iraq for several years.osthoff hails from glonn in the southern german state of bavaria where osthoff 's daughter also lives .
it was not clear where the mother and child would be reunited . jäger said the german authorities have been assured that her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani had also been freed following osthoff 's release on sunday , in sound health , after 24 days in the hands of unknown kidnappers . the pair was seized on november 25 in the nineveh region of northwest iraq . but while osthoff was " at the moment still at the german embassy in baghdad , " shimani 's whereabouts were unknown , jäger told journalists .
" we were told that he is free but as yet he has not come to the german embassy , " jäger said . details wrapped in secrecy jäger added that " the german government and the german embassy in baghdad were involved " in securing osthoff 's release , but he declined to give further details , including whether the united states had helped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff 's parents raise a toast as they receive news of their daughter 's release indeed , mystery still surrounds the german government 's exact role in freeing osthoff . questions such as who exactly played mediator and whether any ransom was paid still remain unanswered on monday - and are likely to remain under wraps . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister said monday that leaking the details of osthoff 's release to the public would give potential kidnappers indications of " how to handle something like this and how they could achieve results with what means and resources . " given that at least five further westerners are still being held by kidnappers in iraq , experts have also indicated that going public with the details of osthoff 's release could hamper ongoing efforts towards freeing them . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably have done so for osthoff as well . two years ago , the german government managed to secure the release of 14 german hostages in the sahara desert after they were held for six months in captivitiy .
at the time , then german foreign minister joschka fischer said negotiations had been " extremely difficult , " prompting the media to speculate that berlin had paid some five million euros as ransom to the kidnappers .
however , the reports were never confirmed . speculation continues german newspapers on monday noted that most of the ircumstances surrounding the kidnapping remained a mystery , while the government said osthoff had decided not to talk about the experience . " osthoff has made it clear that she does not wish to speak about the circumstances of her kidnapping , " jäger said . she was the first german national to be taken hostage in iraq , and the kidnapping posed the first serious crisis for merkel since she took office last month . the daily berliner zeitung said on monday that merkel 's government had " acquitted itself well in its first foreign policy crisis .
the chancellor and her foreign minister acted with discretion , " it said . but speculation over whether the government had paid a ransom continued unabated . " even after her release the affair remains mysterious , " bild said . merkel had appealed to the kidnappers to release the pair , but insisted that berlin would not be blackmailed . the weekly magazine focus said that according to foreign ministry sources , osthoff was seized by a group calling itself the army of the mujahedin , which initially thought she was a spy working for a western government , but later realized she was not . according to german press reports in november , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for osthoff 's release shortly after she was seized . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen - though not on german soil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany can learn from osthoff on sunday night , germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier announced that after more than three weeks in captivity , abducted archeologist , susanne osthoff is free .

mitochondrial dna is handed down through the maternal line , and is a relatively stable genetic sequence - it changes little from generation to generation , and at a measurable rhythm .
this makes mitochondrial dna a useful " molecular clock " that can be wound backwards into time , to see how a species evolved .
by comparing the sequence with that of modern animals , scientists can spot when and where species diverged from their common ancestor . in this case , the closest relative today to mammuthus primigenius is the asian elephant rather than the african elephant , the researchers say .
the difference , though , is not great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scientists say the african elephant is a descendent of the woolly mammoth african elephants branched away from the mammoth 's evolutionary tree around six million years ago .
asian elephants followed suit around only 440,000 years later .
that timeline of divergence is intriguingly close to that of gorillas , chimps and humans in how they branched out from the primates ' family tree . the mammoth team was led by michael hofreiter of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig .
degraded samples previous efforts to recover pre-ice age species have run into the predictable problem of retrieving material that has not rotted after 10,000 years or more in the permafrost . until now , little more than 1,000 base pairs - the " letters " on the dna code which make up the chemical recipe for making and sustaining life - have been coaxed out of these frozen samples .
the previous maximum was 1,600 base pairs .
but by using their new approach to gently amplify the ancient dna , hofreiter 's team were able to get 5,000 base pairs , even though their sample , too , was degraded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drawing of a mammoth and a horse in a cave near combe d 'arc , france woolly mammoths once roamed far and wide across the northern reaches of eurasia and north america , but no trace of them survives beyond the end of the last ice age , some 11,000 years ago .
their heavy layers of fat , their long brown top hair and thick woolly undercoat were superb for bitter cold but left them ill-equipped for a warmer climate and the rise of homo sapiens . they are among the best-researched animals of the ice age , thanks to the preservation of carcasses in frozen ground and the pictures of the creatures made by stone age artists in european caves . the bone used in the latest research came from the banks of the berelekh river in yakutia , where thousands of bones , belonging to some 160 mammoths , have been recovered . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : ' curse of the iceman ' linked to scientist 's death the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior .

public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb . germany is playing a game of catch-up .
although corruption has long been part of the fabric of society , an unwavering adherence to the tenet " ignorance is bliss " has served as a buffer zone for those involved in the business of shady deals .
but now the winds of change have begun to whip at the nation 's door as germans realize their country is affected too . corruption is indeed widespread in germany , according to transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , a non-governmental organization devoted to combating the practice .
ti defines it as " the misuse of entrusted power for private gain . " the very notion of corruption has been promoted in people 's perceptions , according to the german chapter 's head , hansjörg elshorst .
" it is now on the agenda and is getting more media attention , which heightens interest , " he said .
so much so that germans wrongly view their country as being more corrupt than western europe collectively perceives itself to be , ti surveys suggest . corporate corruption while the findings of the ti corruption barometer show politicians to have the most sullied standing among the german public , elshorst is at pains to point out that it is only a matter of time before the woeful reality of corruption in the business world seeps into the national psyche . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl was beset by a funding scandal " the first corruption scandals to hit the media were of a political nature , so people simply assume that politicians are the bad guys .
we have to regain some balance and demonstrate to people the reality of the situation in other areas , " elshorst said , referring to bent business practices , which , in the absence of a suitably prominent name , are generally of little interest to the outside world .
the problem is immense .
uwe dolata , spokesman for the german association of detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- and an expert in white-collar crime , says corruption is so inherent in german business that the police have created a special division to deal with it . " for a long time white-collar crime was a very uncomfortable subject and we had no specialist detectives in the field , " dolata said .
" now we have target-trained financial investigators in every state across germany . " multiple dangers dolata stresses the importance of clamping down on corruption in the business world , which he says is not only damaging to the economy , society and democracy in germany , but can also pose a threat to public health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry is just one which is prone to corruption " a contractor takes the highest sum of money offered but is not really interested in how the job is done , " he said , adding that having secured a contract through bribery , a client might be inclined to make savings at the cost of safety in order to recoup the cost of the sweetener . with an estimated 95 percent of corporate corruption cases going unreported , there is apparently massive scope for tighter measures , both corrective and preventative , to fight it . dolata believes one step could be introducing ombudsmen , third parties to whom those in the know can quietly and anonymously blow the whistle on those in the wrong .
he cites the deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , germany 's rail operator , as an example of an organization that has managed to cut corruption through the introduction of such a system . since db opted to give priority to fighting internal corruption back in 2000 , its ombudsman has helped to uncover 400 cases and subsequently reported a fall in the number of new ones .
db could be a model for other as well as for the next generation of managers , who dolata says have a surprisingly relaxed attitude to corporate crime . enciting change dolata is repeatedly faced with tainted young opinions at the university of würzburg , where teaches anti-corruption .
" students come to my lectures believing that corruption is an essential part of the business world .
their approach is one of ' everyone does it and if i want to get ahead , i 'll have to do it too . '
the blame for that thinking lies largely with the media , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sealed with a cordial hand-shake if the widespread belief is that bribery rules , and that belief is reflected in reality , any number of ombudsmen wo n't necessarily solve the problem .
transparency international has long been calling for a corruption register that would operate like a black list .
the last government came close to introducing such a register , but as yet , there has been no indication from the new coalition as to whether it will be pushed through . " a central register would make companies rather than individuals suffer , " elshorst said .
" firms need to be motivated to change .
large companies have already done a lot because they realize how their image can be damaged , but smaller businesses have not yet been put under any pressure to change . " but even if that change is enforced via a structured naming and shaming process , there would be nothing to stop crooked private contractors from continuing to collaborate with those on the black list .
ultimately , it would remain a question of conscience . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany slides in corruption ranking germany slipped one notch in the annual survey of countries ranked by their levels of corruption compiled by berlin-based ngo tranparency international .

for many companies it is an opportunity to fill their coffers in a festive boom that can make or break the business year .
according to the british retail consortium -lrb- brc -rrb- shoppers spent more than £ 31bn in december last year , with £ 10bn of that going on gifts alone .
the months of november , december and january can account for as much as 60 % of the annual turnover at large retailers , the brc believes .
despite a difficult year for the high street in general , demand seems to have picked up again .
the latest data from researcher spsl shows shopper numbers in november and at the start of december have increased across the uk from last year .
old dogs , new tricks at the same time , consumers have been changing their habits , and the brc said that people are planning earlier for christmas , trying to spread the cost over a number of months to avoid taking one big hit in december .
christmas facts on average , each person will spend £ 300 on christmas gifts .
the average household will spend £ 160 on food and drink an estimated 1.7 billion christmas cards will be sent to friends and family the average christmas lunch costs £ 12 per head , without alcohol children , on average , will get gifts worth more than £ 250 .
consumers will buy £ 1.2bn-worth of christmas trees and about 35 million will be grown to cope with demand britons buy 52 square miles of wrapping paper , enough to cover hyde park 33 times over .
source : british retail consortium and instead of fighting their way down high streets , many consumers are doing their shopping online .
the value of goods bought over the internet topped the £ 2bn mark for the first time in november , 50 % more than a year earlier , analytical firm imrg said .
in fact , if the number of online shops actually opened up their own bricks and mortar premises , they would create a high street that was 50 miles long , it said .
one warning , though : the post-christmas sales could see slimmer discounts than many hope .
the brc says retailers are being much more canny about ordering and keeping stock , and therefore are unlikely to be left with a lot of unsold goods after christmas .
big birds but while the end of year sales may be under threat , in the lead-up to christmas shoppers seem less worried about counting the pennies .
paul kelly is a turkey farmer from essex whose family have been rearing and selling the butterball birds since 1971 .
mr kelly 's birds go for about £ 45 each , about £ 9 a kilo , many times more than a similar turkey would cost in the supermarket .
as well as the taste , which he puts down to the fact that his birds are slow-grown from june , mr kelly reckons that christmas is behind the willingness of shoppers to pay over the odds for their dinner-time centrepiece .
" people are willing to trade up , " he explained .
" for the rest of the year they are at the mercy of the weekly shop .
at christmas they do n't want to scrimp and save . "
this consumer urge to splash out also is being seen by cracker company robin reed .
" crackers are such a central part to the day , they sit on the dinner table and people focus on them , " said caroline nash , the firm 's director of sales and marketing .
splash the cash the ostentatious nature of christmas may explain why consumers seem so willing to head for the shops .
one addiction counsellor , who wished to remain anonymous , explained that the holiday period gives people an excuse to do what they normally would not - almost offering carte blanche for a bank balance-busting blow-out .
average xmas household spend £ 160 on food and drink £ 660 on gifts £ 20 on cards £ 20 on crackers £ 35 on christmas tree source : british retail consortium the pleasure , however transitory , of giving and receiving gifts can mark a high point at a dark and cold time of year .
the feel-good factor aside , consumers are no dummies and while they may be willing to pay top dollar , making sure a company gets its slice requires lengthy planning .
to get some of the £ 160 the average british family spends on their christmas dinner , mr kelly starts mapping out his turkey-breeding schedule almost before the leftovers have gone cold .
west midlands-based robin reed already is designing 2006 's cracker ranges , working out what will go inside them and checking to make sure the jokes are not too close to the bone .
even getting the humble brussels sprout to the table requires a military-style operation .
sainsbury 's vegetable buyer russell crowe explained that sprout pickers are working 24 hours a day in the lead up to christmas , when as much as 25 % of the year 's total sales are cashed .
with the rewards and expectations so high , companies and consumers will be loath to leave any goodies on the christmas table .

us-based human rights watch says it has credible reports that eight people now being held at guantanamo bay were tortured at the prison .
the organisation says the accusation is based on accounts given to its lawyers .
the us has been criticised by human rights groups over its treatment of detainees from afghanistan and iraq .
human rights watch group says the detainees were kept in total darkness and mistreated .
" they were chained to walls , deprived of food and drinking water , and kept in total darkness with loud rap , heavy metal music , or other sounds blared for weeks a time , " the organisation said .
" some detainees said they were shackled in a manner that made it impossible to lie down or sleep , with restraints that caused their hands and wrists to swell up or bruise . "
human rights watch says the accounts warrant an official investigation .
' no torture ' the us has neither confirmed nor denied reports of secret cia-run prisons in other countries , but says none of its interrogation techniques amounts to torture .
" i can say that we , in fact , are consistent with the commitments of the united states that we do n't engage in torture and we do n't , " us vice president dick cheney said in an interview on abc news .
about 500 prisoners remain at guantanamo , many of them captured in afghanistan .
some have been held for nearly four years without charge .
united nations officials have been trying to visit the camp since it opened in 2002 but have only been offered restricted access , which it has rejected .

the organisation said the number of times its volunteer crews were called out between 24 december and 3 january had quadrupled since 1980 .
new year 's day is typically the busiest day of all , it said .
rnli sea safety manager peter chennell urged sailors to take care over the holiday period and warned not to drink alcohol before setting sail .
nationally , rnli lifeboat launches over christmas and new year have increased by 300 % since 1980 - almost twice the annual average increase .
when that call for help comes it does n't matter where you are , what you 're doing or what time of year it is - you 've just got to drop everything and go rnli volunteer robin copley in recent years , volunteers at st davids lifeboat station in pembrokeshire and moelfre station on anglesey have had call-outs at christmas .
rnli second coxswain michael williams was about to sit down with his wife and five children for lunch on christmas day last year when he was called away .
mr williams said : " it was just before midday and we were waiting for my parents to arrive for christmas dinner when the pager went off . "
ten volunteers rushed to launch the inshore lifeboat in response to reports of a yacht in difficulty in red wharf bay .
it later emerged the boat had broken free from its moorings with no-one on board .
mr williams added : " luckily last year we were able to get home in time to enjoy christmas with our families , but this year may well be different .
' care and attention ' rnli crew members at st davids were also called out in rough seas last christmas to rescue three men stranded on board a burning trawler at night .
robin copley - who recently received an rnli award for his efforts during the rescue - said : " when that call for help comes , it does n't matter where you are , what you 're doing or what time of year it is - you 've just got to drop everything and go .
" all that matters is that someone 's in trouble and they are relying on you to get out there and help them . "
the rnli said it just took a " little care and attention " to avoid getting into difficulties .
it advised people not to sail , swim or surf in wintry conditions and to take extra care when walking .
peter chennell , rnli sea safety manager , urged : " please , whatever you 're doing this christmas , do n't add to the increasing rescue statistics , which indicate that new year 's day is the busiest day of the festive period for our volunteer crews . "
" if you plan to go for a seaside or cliff top walk , or intend to sail , surf or swim - our best safety advice is to be properly prepared in terms of clothing and equipment and never to mix alcohol with the sea . "

the small population in wales has risen by almost 30 % since the results of the first major survey a decade ago .
numbers fell by almost 30 % in scotland - which still has 66 % of the uk population .
in england , numbers stayed the same .
there are 5,100 males in the uk , and wales has 213 .
calculations are based on males because they are the most visible of the species , carrying out flamboyant displays to attract partners .
patrick lindley , upland species officer with the bird conservation charity rspb cymru , said the new figures for the uk - released on monday - were generally disappointing , apart from the news for wales .
black grouse facts male : glossy blue-black plumage , striking red wattles , curved black tail feathers ; females are camouflaged in reddish brown plumage more than 20 males can gather on early spring mornings .
males strut to show off their tail feathers and accompany their circular display with a cooing , bubbling song to attract females .
after mating , male birds go in search of another partner the males measure 55cm from bill to tail , have a wingspan of 80cm and weigh around 1.25kg ; females 40cm , have a 65cm wingspan and weigh about 950g .
" if the trend continues , it could soon be a conservation catastrophe , " he said .
the black grouse is one of the hardest species to help because it has demanding habitat requirements .
it needs dense vegetation , cover for nesting and protection from predators and mature woodland for winter food .
pairs also need boggy areas , which are home to insects for chicks .
the species was once widespread in wales and found in meirionnydd , montgomeryshire , carmarthenshire , breconshire and ceredigion .
it is now confined to the uplands of north and mid wales , but the increase in numbers has given conservationists reason to be optimistic .
one of the best places to see the male birds displaying or " lekking " is in coed llandegla in denbighshire .
agencies in other parts of the uk plan to replicate welsh conservation projects , in the hope of achieving similar success .
the welsh black grouse recovery project was launched in june 1999 to halt the bird 's serious decline from 264 males in 1986 to 131 in 1997 .
without it , the species could have been extinct in wales by 2010 .
' partnership approach ' funding from the european union , the welsh assembly government , the rspb , countryside council for wales -lrb- ccw -rrb- , and forestry commission wales allowed habitats in six key areas of north and mid wales to be improved and managed specifically for black grouse .
mr lindley said : " the success of our partnership work here in wales shows that the right habitat measures in the right places are effective . "
siân whitehead , ccw 's senior ornithologist , said the rise in numbers in wales was encouraging .
" the progress that has been made in conserving the welsh black grouse population is a good example of what can be achieved through partnership working , " she said .
" it is important that this work continues , to ensure that the black grouse population gains that have been made are consolidated , and the species range can be allowed to expand . "

the small population in wales has risen by almost 30 % since the results of the first major survey a decade ago .
numbers fell by almost 30 % in scotland - which still has 66 % of the uk population .
in england , numbers stayed the same .
there are 5,100 males in the uk , and wales has 213 .
calculations are based on males because they are the most visible of the species , carrying out flamboyant displays to attract partners .
patrick lindley , upland species officer with the bird conservation charity rspb cymru , said the new figures for the uk - released on monday - were generally disappointing , apart from the news for wales .
black grouse facts male : glossy blue-black plumage , striking red wattles , curved black tail feathers ; females are camouflaged in reddish brown plumage more than 20 males can gather on early spring mornings .
males strut to show off their tail feathers and accompany their circular display with a cooing , bubbling song to attract females .
after mating , male birds go in search of another partner the males measure 55cm from bill to tail , have a wingspan of 80cm and weigh around 1.25kg ; females 40cm , have a 65cm wingspan and weigh about 950g .
" if the trend continues , it could soon be a conservation catastrophe , " he said .
the black grouse is one of the hardest species to help because it has demanding habitat requirements .
it needs dense vegetation , cover for nesting and protection from predators and mature woodland for winter food .
pairs also need boggy areas , which are home to insects for chicks .
the species was once widespread in wales and found in meirionnydd , montgomeryshire , carmarthenshire , breconshire and ceredigion .
it is now confined to the uplands of north and mid wales , but the increase in numbers has given conservationists reason to be optimistic .
one of the best places to see the male birds displaying or " lekking " is in coed llandegla in denbighshire .
agencies in other parts of the uk plan to replicate welsh conservation projects , in the hope of achieving similar success .
the welsh black grouse recovery project was launched in june 1999 to halt the bird 's serious decline from 264 males in 1986 to 131 in 1997 .
without it , the species could have been extinct in wales by 2010 .
' partnership approach ' funding from the european union , the welsh assembly government , the rspb , countryside council for wales -lrb- ccw -rrb- , and forestry commission wales allowed habitats in six key areas of north and mid wales to be improved and managed specifically for black grouse .
mr lindley said : " the success of our partnership work here in wales shows that the right habitat measures in the right places are effective . "
siân whitehead , ccw 's senior ornithologist , said the rise in numbers in wales was encouraging .
" the progress that has been made in conserving the welsh black grouse population is a good example of what can be achieved through partnership working , " she said .
" it is important that this work continues , to ensure that the black grouse population gains that have been made are consolidated , and the species range can be allowed to expand . "

in the spiritual home of the super-sized meal , more than 119 million adults - or 64.5 % of the adult population - are either overweight or obese .
obesity in the us is linked to 300,000 deaths a year and said to add billions to the country 's medical bills .
and the problem is growing .
by the time of the next olympics , doctors predict that three out of four people in the country will have a body mass index of more than 25 , the benchmark of corpulence .
the problem of obesity in schools is described by the us surgeon general as " every bit as threatening to us as is the terrorist threat we face today " .

the american beverage industry , some of whose members are preparing for an imminent lawsuit on this issue , says soft drink sales in schools are not a major factor in rising childhood obesity rates .
