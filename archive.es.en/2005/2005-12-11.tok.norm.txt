" this meeting will be very serious .
everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned talks - provisionally scheduled to take place in vienna on december 21 . " we expect this meeting to pay attention to the facts and iran 's rights .
we believe that we must be treated without discrimination .
we do n't want more than others and we wo n't settle for anything less , " he said . " the topic will be iran 's right to enrichment , " he added . eu-iran talks collapsed in august when tehran ended its suspension of uranium conversion , a first step towards enrichment , and the planned talks are aimed at exploring if an avenue for resuming negotiations is open . but the two sides remain totally deadlocked over the core issue of iran 's effort to master the entire nuclear fuel cycle - a process that culminates in the enrichment of uranium . iran argues peaceful nuclear energy a " right " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea director general mohamed elbaradei has to balance the claims of iran with proliferation fears .
as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , iran argues that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes is a " right " .
but the process of enriching uranium can be extended to make weapons material can be extended to military purposes . the eu-3 - backed by the united states - want iran to give up such work as an " objective guarantee " it will not acquire weapons .
they want to push for a compromise under which iran 's enrichment work would be carried out in russia , although this has already been rejected by tehran . asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears to be out of the question . europeans hold the key , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus is on the likes of british foreign secretary jack straw and eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .
" it all depends on the european side and whether they enter the talks and give us our rights , " he said . the international atomic energy agency has said iran is not complying with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , which could lead to referral to the un security council and possible sanctions . tensions heightened over israel remarks the iaea last month put off such action after the eu-3 agreed to give time for russian diplomacy to work .
but the climate for talks has worsened after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad questioned the holocaust and suggested israel be relocated to europe .
in october he provoked a similar diplomatic storm after calling for israel to be " wiped off the map .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

" we have reached legal security , " meaning it will not be possible in the future to sue the austrian state for individual compensation , schüssel said , after meeting president george w. bush at the white house . a lawsuit demanding compensation from austria for jews whose property was seized by nazis has been withdrawn , after the last 25 plaintiffs in the case each signed a statement to that effect , their lawyer jay fialkoff said . last month , a federal appeals court in new york dismissed the suit , acknowledging an argument from austria that it could not be subject to a ruling by a foreign court .
us government lawyers also argued that the suit ran counter to washington 's foreign policy interests . the parliament in vienna gave the green light to the payments in november ; as soon as a guarantee was given there would be no more legal battles . victims of nazi annexation to split compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of austrian jews were forced into labor camps and the property stolen .
over 20,000 austrian jews whose property was stolen by the nazis between 1938 -lrb- when hitler 's germany annexed austria -rrb- and the end of the war in 1945 , will now share the 210 million dollars made available by the state , the city of vienna , banks and insurance companies . agreements to that end were made in 2000 and 2001 between vienna and the jewish community but austria refused to implement them for lack of " legal security . " until 2000 austria , which saw itself as the first victim of the nazis thanks to an allied agreement describing it as such , had never paid any compensation to jewish victims , unlike germany . but after the " waldheim affair " - named after austria 's late president kurt waldheim -lrb- 1986-1992 -rrb- who was accused of hiding his activities with the wehrmacht , the german army - austria was strongly criticized and accused of hiding its past .
vienna reacted by initiating compensation payments in 2000 . the " national fund " which handles the distribution of financial means to the victims regretted that " some passed away before they could receive their due " . further restitutions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artworks stolen from austrian jews will be returned to survivors and relatives .
the restitution of buildings , houses and works of art which are still today public property , as well as the reconstruction in vienna of the pre-war jewish sports club , hakoah , are also planned . austria 's jews have as a community already received 9 million euros -lrb- 10.6 million dollars -rrb- in compensation for synagogues and buildings destroyed by the nazis , and are expected to receive a similar sum again soon . the jewish community in austria was one of the most thriving in central and eastern europe in the inter-war period , with intellectuals such as sigmund freud and writers such as arthur schnitzler and stefan zweig .
over 200,000 jews lived in austria in 1938 .
of those , 65,000 died at the hand of the nazis . today 's jewish community only has about 10,000 members left . final compensation will be third phase of payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors of the slave labor camps have been compensated .
two types of compensation have already been distributed in austria : 150 million euros -lrb- 177 million dollars -rrb- to jews who left valuables behind when they were thrown out of their rented flats by the nazis , and 352 million euros -lrb- 415 million dollars -rrb- for about 132,000 former slave labor victims who were forced to do back-breaking work in austria . the austrian daily der standard in a recent editorial referred to " the bitter realization that one can not make up for injustices of this nature with money and that all this -lrb- about 10,000 euros or 11,800 dollars per person -rrb- is much too little .

" until 2000 austria , which saw itself as the first victim of the nazis thanks to an allied agreement describing it as such , had never paid any compensation to jewish victims , unlike germany . but after the " waldheim affair " - named after austria 's late president kurt waldheim -lrb- 1986-1992 -rrb- who was accused of hiding his activities with the wehrmacht , the german army - austria was strongly criticized and accused of hiding its past .
vienna reacted by initiating compensation payments in 2000 . the " national fund " which handles the distribution of financial means to the victims regretted that " some passed away before they could receive their due " . further restitutions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artworks stolen from austrian jews will be returned to survivors and relatives .
the restitution of buildings , houses and works of art which are still today public property , as well as the reconstruction in vienna of the pre-war jewish sports club , hakoah , are also planned . austria 's jews have as a community already received 9 million euros -lrb- 10.6 million dollars -rrb- in compensation for synagogues and buildings destroyed by the nazis , and are expected to receive a similar sum again soon . the jewish community in austria was one of the most thriving in central and eastern europe in the inter-war period , with intellectuals such as sigmund freud and writers such as arthur schnitzler and stefan zweig .
over 200,000 jews lived in austria in 1938 .
of those , 65,000 died at the hand of the nazis . today 's jewish community only has about 10,000 members left . final compensation will be third phase of payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors of the slave labor camps have been compensated .
two types of compensation have already been distributed in austria : 150 million euros -lrb- 177 million dollars -rrb- to jews who left valuables behind when they were thrown out of their rented flats by the nazis , and 352 million euros -lrb- 415 million dollars -rrb- for about 132,000 former slave labor victims who were forced to do back-breaking work in austria . the austrian daily der standard in a recent editorial referred to " the bitter realization that one can not make up for injustices of this nature with money and that all this -lrb- about 10,000 euros or 11,800 dollars per person -rrb- is much too little .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past .

after 11 years , and 2 billion euros , one of the biggest projects is finally finished . for decades , drivers had to endure the narrow streets leading through villages to get from east to west and back again .
but now all that is to change with the completion of germany 's transport-project number one , the 325 km long baltic sea motorway or a20 . the autobahn , which runs parallel to the baltic sea , connects the western german city of lübeck with stettin in poland and is being hailed as an economic boon to germany 's economically troubled northeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better access to the east " the baltic sea motorway is very important for our state , " said mecklenburg western-pomerania premier harald ringstorff .
" we did not have a single west-east- connection , but now we are going to benefit from the new a20 .
we already have a number of companies that settled along the motorway , it 's great for us and everyone who wants to come here .
tourism is booming now too , especially short-term tourism . "
worth the wait volker kock who oversees the project from the federal planning office says it took eleven years and 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- to build the four-lane a 20 , the fastest a motorway has been built in germany since the war .
it connects the main land with germany 's biggest island rügen .
it also plays a major role in european east-west-transport . " the a20 is part of the trans-european street network and that shows its importance : not only the connection from lübeck to stettin , but also the western link-up is now being discussed and planned , " he said .
" we are also looking east in the direction of poland and we have to see what is happening in the new eu-countries . " not everyone is happy about the construction of the a 20 .
environmentalists have accused the motorway project of causing the biggest destruction of green sites since german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the 2 billion euro autobahn took 11 years but politicians and engineers say they have given the environment a high priority by allocating 10 percent of the budget to environmental measures , adding that the motorway is necessary for the boost of the economically underdeveloped region .
still , it is not clear how much the economic impact on mecklenburg-west-pomerania will be . officials hope that effective marketing and less bureaucracy will help draw investment and jobs to state .
but instead , it could attract investors to stettin in poland where the wages are lower . kerstin winter and bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel takes heat out of russian gas deal in poland seeking to improve relations soured by plans to build a baltic gas pipeline between russia and europe , german chancellor angela merkel has promised she will not go over poland 's head in dealing with moscow .

" the pds , the wasg and the new party will contribute to creating a democratic alternative to oppose the damage caused by neoliberalism to social cohesion , " left party leader lothar bisky told the 400 congress delegates . " we must and will create a common leftist social party , which all germany needs , " added the head of the party 's parliamentary group , gregor gysi . the elections failed to give a clear majority to the outgoing ruling social democrats or the main opposition christian democrats , who ended up forming a coalition headed by christian democrat chancellor angela merkel . spd deserters and former communists cover bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi and lafontaine have the east and west covered with their politics .
while the former communists derive most of their backing in the east , the wasg , formed by deserters from the social democrats such as former finance minister oskar lafontaine in february , has its support base in the west . " we must unite to respect the desire of the electorate who voted for us , because without us there is not more left in parliament , " lafontaine said . many wasg members are however wary of a merger , fearing they will be swallowed up by the pds , which they accuse of not shaking off its communist past . stasi revelations dog the new left dawn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east 's secret past still dogs some of the region 's politicians .

" this meeting will be very serious .
everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned talks - provisionally scheduled to take place in vienna on december 21 . " we expect this meeting to pay attention to the facts and iran 's rights .
we believe that we must be treated without discrimination .
we do n't want more than others and we wo n't settle for anything less , " he said . " the topic will be iran 's right to enrichment , " he added . eu-iran talks collapsed in august when tehran ended its suspension of uranium conversion , a first step towards enrichment , and the planned talks are aimed at exploring if an avenue for resuming negotiations is open . but the two sides remain totally deadlocked over the core issue of iran 's effort to master the entire nuclear fuel cycle - a process that culminates in the enrichment of uranium . iran argues peaceful nuclear energy a " right " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea director general mohamed elbaradei has to balance the claims of iran with proliferation fears .
as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , iran argues that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes is a " right " .
but the process of enriching uranium can be extended to make weapons material can be extended to military purposes . the eu-3 - backed by the united states - want iran to give up such work as an " objective guarantee " it will not acquire weapons .
they want to push for a compromise under which iran 's enrichment work would be carried out in russia , although this has already been rejected by tehran . asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears to be out of the question . europeans hold the key , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus is on the likes of british foreign secretary jack straw and eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .
" it all depends on the european side and whether they enter the talks and give us our rights , " he said . the international atomic energy agency has said iran is not complying with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , which could lead to referral to the un security council and possible sanctions . tensions heightened over israel remarks the iaea last month put off such action after the eu-3 agreed to give time for russian diplomacy to work .
but the climate for talks has worsened after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad questioned the holocaust and suggested israel be relocated to europe .
in october he provoked a similar diplomatic storm after calling for israel to be " wiped off the map . " iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani has also warned that his country could soon resume making centrifuges - the devices used to enrich uranium - and conducting " research .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past .

afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .

chances are someone is going your way want to travel from berlin to cologne , but can ’ t afford the train fare and don ’ t feel like hitchhiking ?
then jump on the net and check out germany ’ s best kept travel secret - ridesharing . ridesharing , called mitfahren in german , links up drivers and passengers , and is the cheapest way to get around the country .
drivers usually charge about five euros per hundred kilometers , which is significantly cheaper than the train . there are thousands of agencies online , but the two biggest are mitfahrzentrale.de and mitfahrgelegenheiten.de.
they are simple to use - you just have to put in your departure point , your destination and the date of travel .
with a couple of mouse clicks and a bit of luck , you can locate a driver and then e-mail , text message or simply ring up to see if there 's still a seat in the car . kathrin matzen , who uses ridesharing about once a month to visit friends across germany , as well as in neighboring belgium , france and the netherlands , says that she has never had a problem organizing a lift , and that the whole thing is “ incredibly easy . ” just like any road trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers and travelers reap the benefits .
in addition to saving money and helping to protect the environment through less pollution , kathrin says she likes ridesharing because it 's more fun than traveling alone on the train . “ i have had trips that were just a blast .
the people can be mixed in age and occupation , and everyone has different opinions , which makes the time just pass really quickly , ” she says . but , just like any car journey , there is always the possibility that break-downs or traffic jams can slow down a trip .
a couple of kathrin ’ s lifts have involved hours spent at the side of the motorway waiting for a mechanic to turn up . “ you can ’ t be in a hurry .
when you have to be somewhere on time , then it ’ s not always the best to go with a shared ride , ” she admits . another drawback is that passengers can be at the mercy of bad drivers .
andreas vierkötter used to work at a ridesharing agency , but the first time he used it to organize a lift for himself , was enough to put him off for ever . “ it was really , really bad .
i was terribly afraid of the lady ’ s driving style , and i decided that i would never ever do it again , ” he says . not a new thing ride-sharing agencies first started in germany in the mid-fifties .

although it 's difficult to know exactly how many people rideshare in germany , when mitfahrzentrale.de launched seven years ago , it only had a couple hundred users .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 11.12.2005 the 21st century alternative to hitching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do you want to go today ?
chances are someone is going your way want to travel from berlin to cologne , but can ’ t afford the train fare and don ’ t feel like hitchhiking ?
then jump on the net and check out germany ’ s best kept travel secret - ridesharing . ridesharing , called mitfahren in german , links up drivers and passengers , and is the cheapest way to get around the country .
drivers usually charge about five euros per hundred kilometers , which is significantly cheaper than the train . there are thousands of agencies online , but the two biggest are mitfahrzentrale.de and mitfahrgelegenheiten.de.
they are simple to use - you just have to put in your departure point , your destination and the date of travel .
with a couple of mouse clicks and a bit of luck , you can locate a driver and then e-mail , text message or simply ring up to see if there 's still a seat in the car . kathrin matzen , who uses ridesharing about once a month to visit friends across germany , as well as in neighboring belgium , france and the netherlands , says that she has never had a problem organizing a lift , and that the whole thing is “ incredibly easy . ” just like any road trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers and travelers reap the benefits .
in addition to saving money and helping to protect the environment through less pollution , kathrin says she likes ridesharing because it 's more fun than traveling alone on the train . “ i have had trips that were just a blast .
the people can be mixed in age and occupation , and everyone has different opinions , which makes the time just pass really quickly , ” she says . but , just like any car journey , there is always the possibility that break-downs or traffic jams can slow down a trip .
a couple of kathrin ’ s lifts have involved hours spent at the side of the motorway waiting for a mechanic to turn up . “ you can ’ t be in a hurry .
when you have to be somewhere on time , then it ’ s not always the best to go with a shared ride , ” she admits . another drawback is that passengers can be at the mercy of bad drivers .
andreas vierkötter used to work at a ridesharing agency , but the first time he used it to organize a lift for himself , was enough to put him off for ever . “ it was really , really bad .
i was terribly afraid of the lady ’ s driving style , and i decided that i would never ever do it again , ” he says . not a new thing ride-sharing agencies first started in germany in the mid-fifties .
by the 1970s , hundreds of official telephone agencies had sprouted up across the country .
the phone agencies still exist – but more and more people are turning to the internet because the service is cheaper -lrb- sometimes even free -rrb- and it ’ s more flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has connected those who drive and those who are just along for the ride .
although it 's difficult to know exactly how many people rideshare in germany , when mitfahrzentrale.de launched seven years ago , it only had a couple hundred users .
today , the figure has jumped to 650,000 users a month . one of the problems with the internet , however , is its anonymity .
at the telephone agencies , drivers have to leave a copy of their license in order to register .
the internet has no such controls . when martina becker first started ride-sharing 18 months ago she always gave her parents the license plate number and the driver ’ s phone number . “ i said , if i am dead , then this is who you ring , he ’ s the one who did it . ” martina says she has now stopped worrying , because she has never had a bad experience . ” everyone who rideshares is relatively normal , so i don ’ t feel funny about using it anymore , ” she says . gasoline prices driving up business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have increased the use of ridesharing in germany .
martina ’ s boyfriend tobias gutbrodt also rideshares , but as a driver , not as a passenger .
tobias studies in bonn and drives the 300km to his home town of karlsruhe nearly every weekend .
he says petrol prices are so high at the moment that he couldn ’ t afford to go home so often if he didn ’ t take along paying passengers . tobias isn ’ t alone in this .
when oil prices skyrocketed in august as a result of hurricane katrina , the number of people using mitfahrzentrale.de jumped by more than 15 percent . tobias says that even if gasoline was cheaper he would still put an ad in the internet because he gets to meet " really nice people . ” “ they are a very diverse lot – men , women , old , young , germans , and foreigners , ” he says .
but then tobias is perhaps a bit biased about ride-sharing because it ’ s how he and martina got together . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car sharing picks up speed once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .

after 11 years , and 2 billion euros , one of the biggest projects is finally finished . for decades , drivers had to endure the narrow streets leading through villages to get from east to west and back again .
but now all that is to change with the completion of germany 's transport-project number one , the 325 km long baltic sea motorway or a20 . the autobahn , which runs parallel to the baltic sea , connects the western german city of lübeck with stettin in poland and is being hailed as an economic boon to germany 's economically troubled northeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better access to the east " the baltic sea motorway is very important for our state , " said mecklenburg western-pomerania premier harald ringstorff .
" we did not have a single west-east- connection , but now we are going to benefit from the new a20 .
we already have a number of companies that settled along the motorway , it 's great for us and everyone who wants to come here .
tourism is booming now too , especially short-term tourism . "
worth the wait volker kock who oversees the project from the federal planning office says it took eleven years and 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- to build the four-lane a 20 , the fastest a motorway has been built in germany since the war .
it connects the main land with germany 's biggest island rügen .
it also plays a major role in european east-west-transport . " the a20 is part of the trans-european street network and that shows its importance : not only the connection from lübeck to stettin , but also the western link-up is now being discussed and planned , " he said .
" we are also looking east in the direction of poland and we have to see what is happening in the new eu-countries . " not everyone is happy about the construction of the a 20 .
environmentalists have accused the motorway project of causing the biggest destruction of green sites since german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the 2 billion euro autobahn took 11 years but politicians and engineers say they have given the environment a high priority by allocating 10 percent of the budget to environmental measures , adding that the motorway is necessary for the boost of the economically underdeveloped region .
still , it is not clear how much the economic impact on mecklenburg-west-pomerania will be . officials hope that effective marketing and less bureaucracy will help draw investment and jobs to state .
but instead , it could attract investors to stettin in poland where the wages are lower . kerstin winter and bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel takes heat out of russian gas deal in poland seeking to improve relations soured by plans to build a baltic gas pipeline between russia and europe , german chancellor angela merkel has promised she will not go over poland 's head in dealing with moscow .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past .

everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned talks - provisionally scheduled to take place in vienna on december 21 . " we expect this meeting to pay attention to the facts and iran 's rights .
we believe that we must be treated without discrimination .
we do n't want more than others and we wo n't settle for anything less , " he said . " the topic will be iran 's right to enrichment , " he added . eu-iran talks collapsed in august when tehran ended its suspension of uranium conversion , a first step towards enrichment , and the planned talks are aimed at exploring if an avenue for resuming negotiations is open . but the two sides remain totally deadlocked over the core issue of iran 's effort to master the entire nuclear fuel cycle - a process that culminates in the enrichment of uranium . iran argues peaceful nuclear energy a " right " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea director general mohamed elbaradei has to balance the claims of iran with proliferation fears .
as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , iran argues that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes is a " right " .
but the process of enriching uranium can be extended to make weapons material can be extended to military purposes . the eu-3 - backed by the united states - want iran to give up such work as an " objective guarantee " it will not acquire weapons .
they want to push for a compromise under which iran 's enrichment work would be carried out in russia , although this has already been rejected by tehran . asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears to be out of the question . europeans hold the key , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus is on the likes of british foreign secretary jack straw and eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .
" it all depends on the european side and whether they enter the talks and give us our rights , " he said . the international atomic energy agency has said iran is not complying with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , which could lead to referral to the un security council and possible sanctions . tensions heightened over israel remarks the iaea last month put off such action after the eu-3 agreed to give time for russian diplomacy to work .
but the climate for talks has worsened after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad questioned the holocaust and suggested israel be relocated to europe .
in october he provoked a similar diplomatic storm after calling for israel to be " wiped off the map . " iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani has also warned that his country could soon resume making centrifuges - the devices used to enrich uranium - and conducting " research .

chances are someone is going your way want to travel from berlin to cologne , but can ’ t afford the train fare and don ’ t feel like hitchhiking ?
then jump on the net and check out germany ’ s best kept travel secret - ridesharing . ridesharing , called mitfahren in german , links up drivers and passengers , and is the cheapest way to get around the country .
drivers usually charge about five euros per hundred kilometers , which is significantly cheaper than the train . there are thousands of agencies online , but the two biggest are mitfahrzentrale.de and mitfahrgelegenheiten.de.
they are simple to use - you just have to put in your departure point , your destination and the date of travel .
with a couple of mouse clicks and a bit of luck , you can locate a driver and then e-mail , text message or simply ring up to see if there 's still a seat in the car . kathrin matzen , who uses ridesharing about once a month to visit friends across germany , as well as in neighboring belgium , france and the netherlands , says that she has never had a problem organizing a lift , and that the whole thing is “ incredibly easy . ” just like any road trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers and travelers reap the benefits .
in addition to saving money and helping to protect the environment through less pollution , kathrin says she likes ridesharing because it 's more fun than traveling alone on the train . “ i have had trips that were just a blast .
the people can be mixed in age and occupation , and everyone has different opinions , which makes the time just pass really quickly , ” she says . but , just like any car journey , there is always the possibility that break-downs or traffic jams can slow down a trip .
a couple of kathrin ’ s lifts have involved hours spent at the side of the motorway waiting for a mechanic to turn up . “ you can ’ t be in a hurry .
when you have to be somewhere on time , then it ’ s not always the best to go with a shared ride , ” she admits . another drawback is that passengers can be at the mercy of bad drivers .
andreas vierkötter used to work at a ridesharing agency , but the first time he used it to organize a lift for himself , was enough to put him off for ever . “ it was really , really bad .
i was terribly afraid of the lady ’ s driving style , and i decided that i would never ever do it again , ” he says . not a new thing ride-sharing agencies first started in germany in the mid-fifties .
by the 1970s , hundreds of official telephone agencies had sprouted up across the country .
the phone agencies still exist – but more and more people are turning to the internet because the service is cheaper -lrb- sometimes even free -rrb- and it ’ s more flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has connected those who drive and those who are just along for the ride .
although it 's difficult to know exactly how many people rideshare in germany , when mitfahrzentrale.de launched seven years ago , it only had a couple hundred users .
today , the figure has jumped to 650,000 users a month . one of the problems with the internet , however , is its anonymity .
at the telephone agencies , drivers have to leave a copy of their license in order to register .
the internet has no such controls . when martina becker first started ride-sharing 18 months ago she always gave her parents the license plate number and the driver ’ s phone number . “ i said , if i am dead , then this is who you ring , he ’ s the one who did it . ” martina says she has now stopped worrying , because she has never had a bad experience . ” everyone who rideshares is relatively normal , so i don ’ t feel funny about using it anymore , ” she says . gasoline prices driving up business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have increased the use of ridesharing in germany .
martina ’ s boyfriend tobias gutbrodt also rideshares , but as a driver , not as a passenger .
tobias studies in bonn and drives the 300km to his home town of karlsruhe nearly every weekend .
he says petrol prices are so high at the moment that he couldn ’ t afford to go home so often if he didn ’ t take along paying passengers . tobias isn ’ t alone in this .
when oil prices skyrocketed in august as a result of hurricane katrina , the number of people using mitfahrzentrale.de jumped by more than 15 percent . tobias says that even if gasoline was cheaper he would still put an ad in the internet because he gets to meet " really nice people . ” “ they are a very diverse lot – men , women , old , young , germans , and foreigners , ” he says .
but then tobias is perhaps a bit biased about ride-sharing because it ’ s how he and martina got together . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car sharing picks up speed once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .
they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense .

after 11 years , and 2 billion euros , one of the biggest projects is finally finished . for decades , drivers had to endure the narrow streets leading through villages to get from east to west and back again .
but now all that is to change with the completion of germany 's transport-project number one , the 325 km long baltic sea motorway or a20 . the autobahn , which runs parallel to the baltic sea , connects the western german city of lübeck with stettin in poland and is being hailed as an economic boon to germany 's economically troubled northeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better access to the east " the baltic sea motorway is very important for our state , " said mecklenburg western-pomerania premier harald ringstorff .
" we did not have a single west-east- connection , but now we are going to benefit from the new a20 .
we already have a number of companies that settled along the motorway , it 's great for us and everyone who wants to come here .
tourism is booming now too , especially short-term tourism . "
worth the wait volker kock who oversees the project from the federal planning office says it took eleven years and 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- to build the four-lane a 20 , the fastest a motorway has been built in germany since the war .
it connects the main land with germany 's biggest island rügen .
it also plays a major role in european east-west-transport . " the a20 is part of the trans-european street network and that shows its importance : not only the connection from lübeck to stettin , but also the western link-up is now being discussed and planned , " he said .
" we are also looking east in the direction of poland and we have to see what is happening in the new eu-countries . " not everyone is happy about the construction of the a 20 .
environmentalists have accused the motorway project of causing the biggest destruction of green sites since german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the 2 billion euro autobahn took 11 years but politicians and engineers say they have given the environment a high priority by allocating 10 percent of the budget to environmental measures , adding that the motorway is necessary for the boost of the economically underdeveloped region .
still , it is not clear how much the economic impact on mecklenburg-west-pomerania will be . officials hope that effective marketing and less bureaucracy will help draw investment and jobs to state .
but instead , it could attract investors to stettin in poland where the wages are lower . kerstin winter and bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel takes heat out of russian gas deal in poland seeking to improve relations soured by plans to build a baltic gas pipeline between russia and europe , german chancellor angela merkel has promised she will not go over poland 's head in dealing with moscow .

after 11 years , and 2 billion euros , one of the biggest projects is finally finished . for decades , drivers had to endure the narrow streets leading through villages to get from east to west and back again .
but now all that is to change with the completion of germany 's transport-project number one , the 325 km long baltic sea motorway or a20 . the autobahn , which runs parallel to the baltic sea , connects the western german city of lübeck with stettin in poland and is being hailed as an economic boon to germany 's economically troubled northeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better access to the east " the baltic sea motorway is very important for our state , " said mecklenburg western-pomerania premier harald ringstorff .
" we did not have a single west-east- connection , but now we are going to benefit from the new a20 .
we already have a number of companies that settled along the motorway , it 's great for us and everyone who wants to come here .
tourism is booming now too , especially short-term tourism . "
worth the wait volker kock who oversees the project from the federal planning office says it took eleven years and 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- to build the four-lane a 20 , the fastest a motorway has been built in germany since the war .
it connects the main land with germany 's biggest island rügen .
it also plays a major role in european east-west-transport . " the a20 is part of the trans-european street network and that shows its importance : not only the connection from lübeck to stettin , but also the western link-up is now being discussed and planned , " he said .
" we are also looking east in the direction of poland and we have to see what is happening in the new eu-countries . " not everyone is happy about the construction of the a 20 .
environmentalists have accused the motorway project of causing the biggest destruction of green sites since german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the 2 billion euro autobahn took 11 years but politicians and engineers say they have given the environment a high priority by allocating 10 percent of the budget to environmental measures , adding that the motorway is necessary for the boost of the economically underdeveloped region .
still , it is not clear how much the economic impact on mecklenburg-west-pomerania will be . officials hope that effective marketing and less bureaucracy will help draw investment and jobs to state .
but instead , it could attract investors to stettin in poland where the wages are lower . kerstin winter and bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel takes heat out of russian gas deal in poland seeking to improve relations soured by plans to build a baltic gas pipeline between russia and europe , german chancellor angela merkel has promised she will not go over poland 's head in dealing with moscow .

" we have reached legal security , " meaning it will not be possible in the future to sue the austrian state for individual compensation , schüssel said , after meeting president george w. bush at the white house . a lawsuit demanding compensation from austria for jews whose property was seized by nazis has been withdrawn , after the last 25 plaintiffs in the case each signed a statement to that effect , their lawyer jay fialkoff said . last month , a federal appeals court in new york dismissed the suit , acknowledging an argument from austria that it could not be subject to a ruling by a foreign court .
us government lawyers also argued that the suit ran counter to washington 's foreign policy interests . the parliament in vienna gave the green light to the payments in november ; as soon as a guarantee was given there would be no more legal battles . victims of nazi annexation to split compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of austrian jews were forced into labor camps and the property stolen .
over 20,000 austrian jews whose property was stolen by the nazis between 1938 -lrb- when hitler 's germany annexed austria -rrb- and the end of the war in 1945 , will now share the 210 million dollars made available by the state , the city of vienna , banks and insurance companies . agreements to that end were made in 2000 and 2001 between vienna and the jewish community but austria refused to implement them for lack of " legal security . " until 2000 austria , which saw itself as the first victim of the nazis thanks to an allied agreement describing it as such , had never paid any compensation to jewish victims , unlike germany . but after the " waldheim affair " - named after austria 's late president kurt waldheim -lrb- 1986-1992 -rrb- who was accused of hiding his activities with the wehrmacht , the german army - austria was strongly criticized and accused of hiding its past .
vienna reacted by initiating compensation payments in 2000 . the " national fund " which handles the distribution of financial means to the victims regretted that " some passed away before they could receive their due " . further restitutions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artworks stolen from austrian jews will be returned to survivors and relatives .
the restitution of buildings , houses and works of art which are still today public property , as well as the reconstruction in vienna of the pre-war jewish sports club , hakoah , are also planned . austria 's jews have as a community already received 9 million euros -lrb- 10.6 million dollars -rrb- in compensation for synagogues and buildings destroyed by the nazis , and are expected to receive a similar sum again soon . the jewish community in austria was one of the most thriving in central and eastern europe in the inter-war period , with intellectuals such as sigmund freud and writers such as arthur schnitzler and stefan zweig .
over 200,000 jews lived in austria in 1938 .
of those , 65,000 died at the hand of the nazis . today 's jewish community only has about 10,000 members left . final compensation will be third phase of payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors of the slave labor camps have been compensated .
two types of compensation have already been distributed in austria : 150 million euros -lrb- 177 million dollars -rrb- to jews who left valuables behind when they were thrown out of their rented flats by the nazis , and 352 million euros -lrb- 415 million dollars -rrb- for about 132,000 former slave labor victims who were forced to do back-breaking work in austria . the austrian daily der standard in a recent editorial referred to " the bitter realization that one can not make up for injustices of this nature with money and that all this -lrb- about 10,000 euros or 11,800 dollars per person -rrb- is much too little .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2005 troubled northeast gets lift from new autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a -lrb- new -rrb- highway runs through it about 25 billion euros went to revamping transportation infrastructure in east germany after reunification .
after 11 years , and 2 billion euros , one of the biggest projects is finally finished . for decades , drivers had to endure the narrow streets leading through villages to get from east to west and back again .
but now all that is to change with the completion of germany 's transport-project number one , the 325 km long baltic sea motorway or a20 . the autobahn , which runs parallel to the baltic sea , connects the western german city of lübeck with stettin in poland and is being hailed as an economic boon to germany 's economically troubled northeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better access to the east " the baltic sea motorway is very important for our state , " said mecklenburg western-pomerania premier harald ringstorff .
" we did not have a single west-east- connection , but now we are going to benefit from the new a20 .
we already have a number of companies that settled along the motorway , it 's great for us and everyone who wants to come here .
tourism is booming now too , especially short-term tourism . "
worth the wait volker kock who oversees the project from the federal planning office says it took eleven years and 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- to build the four-lane a 20 , the fastest a motorway has been built in germany since the war .

" we have reached legal security , " meaning it will not be possible in the future to sue the austrian state for individual compensation , schüssel said , after meeting president george w. bush at the white house . a lawsuit demanding compensation from austria for jews whose property was seized by nazis has been withdrawn , after the last 25 plaintiffs in the case each signed a statement to that effect , their lawyer jay fialkoff said . last month , a federal appeals court in new york dismissed the suit , acknowledging an argument from austria that it could not be subject to a ruling by a foreign court .
us government lawyers also argued that the suit ran counter to washington 's foreign policy interests . the parliament in vienna gave the green light to the payments in november ; as soon as a guarantee was given there would be no more legal battles . victims of nazi annexation to split compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of austrian jews were forced into labor camps and the property stolen .
over 20,000 austrian jews whose property was stolen by the nazis between 1938 -lrb- when hitler 's germany annexed austria -rrb- and the end of the war in 1945 , will now share the 210 million dollars made available by the state , the city of vienna , banks and insurance companies . agreements to that end were made in 2000 and 2001 between vienna and the jewish community but austria refused to implement them for lack of " legal security . " until 2000 austria , which saw itself as the first victim of the nazis thanks to an allied agreement describing it as such , had never paid any compensation to jewish victims , unlike germany . but after the " waldheim affair " - named after austria 's late president kurt waldheim -lrb- 1986-1992 -rrb- who was accused of hiding his activities with the wehrmacht , the german army - austria was strongly criticized and accused of hiding its past .
vienna reacted by initiating compensation payments in 2000 . the " national fund " which handles the distribution of financial means to the victims regretted that " some passed away before they could receive their due " . further restitutions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artworks stolen from austrian jews will be returned to survivors and relatives .
the restitution of buildings , houses and works of art which are still today public property , as well as the reconstruction in vienna of the pre-war jewish sports club , hakoah , are also planned . austria 's jews have as a community already received 9 million euros -lrb- 10.6 million dollars -rrb- in compensation for synagogues and buildings destroyed by the nazis , and are expected to receive a similar sum again soon . the jewish community in austria was one of the most thriving in central and eastern europe in the inter-war period , with intellectuals such as sigmund freud and writers such as arthur schnitzler and stefan zweig .
over 200,000 jews lived in austria in 1938 .
of those , 65,000 died at the hand of the nazis . today 's jewish community only has about 10,000 members left . final compensation will be third phase of payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors of the slave labor camps have been compensated .
two types of compensation have already been distributed in austria : 150 million euros -lrb- 177 million dollars -rrb- to jews who left valuables behind when they were thrown out of their rented flats by the nazis , and 352 million euros -lrb- 415 million dollars -rrb- for about 132,000 former slave labor victims who were forced to do back-breaking work in austria . the austrian daily der standard in a recent editorial referred to " the bitter realization that one can not make up for injustices of this nature with money and that all this -lrb- about 10,000 euros or 11,800 dollars per person -rrb- is much too little .

" this meeting will be very serious .
everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned talks - provisionally scheduled to take place in vienna on december 21 . " we expect this meeting to pay attention to the facts and iran 's rights .
we believe that we must be treated without discrimination .
we do n't want more than others and we wo n't settle for anything less , " he said . " the topic will be iran 's right to enrichment , " he added . eu-iran talks collapsed in august when tehran ended its suspension of uranium conversion , a first step towards enrichment , and the planned talks are aimed at exploring if an avenue for resuming negotiations is open . but the two sides remain totally deadlocked over the core issue of iran 's effort to master the entire nuclear fuel cycle - a process that culminates in the enrichment of uranium . iran argues peaceful nuclear energy a " right " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea director general mohamed elbaradei has to balance the claims of iran with proliferation fears .
as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , iran argues that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes is a " right " .
but the process of enriching uranium can be extended to make weapons material can be extended to military purposes . the eu-3 - backed by the united states - want iran to give up such work as an " objective guarantee " it will not acquire weapons .
they want to push for a compromise under which iran 's enrichment work would be carried out in russia , although this has already been rejected by tehran . asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears to be out of the question . europeans hold the key , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus is on the likes of british foreign secretary jack straw and eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .
" it all depends on the european side and whether they enter the talks and give us our rights , " he said . the international atomic energy agency has said iran is not complying with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , which could lead to referral to the un security council and possible sanctions . tensions heightened over israel remarks the iaea last month put off such action after the eu-3 agreed to give time for russian diplomacy to work .
but the climate for talks has worsened after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad questioned the holocaust and suggested israel be relocated to europe .
in october he provoked a similar diplomatic storm after calling for israel to be " wiped off the map . " iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani has also warned that his country could soon resume making centrifuges - the devices used to enrich uranium - and conducting " research .

chances are someone is going your way want to travel from berlin to cologne , but can ’ t afford the train fare and don ’ t feel like hitchhiking ?
then jump on the net and check out germany ’ s best kept travel secret - ridesharing . ridesharing , called mitfahren in german , links up drivers and passengers , and is the cheapest way to get around the country .
drivers usually charge about five euros per hundred kilometers , which is significantly cheaper than the train . there are thousands of agencies online , but the two biggest are mitfahrzentrale.de and mitfahrgelegenheiten.de.
they are simple to use - you just have to put in your departure point , your destination and the date of travel .
with a couple of mouse clicks and a bit of luck , you can locate a driver and then e-mail , text message or simply ring up to see if there 's still a seat in the car . kathrin matzen , who uses ridesharing about once a month to visit friends across germany , as well as in neighboring belgium , france and the netherlands , says that she has never had a problem organizing a lift , and that the whole thing is “ incredibly easy . ” just like any road trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers and travelers reap the benefits .
in addition to saving money and helping to protect the environment through less pollution , kathrin says she likes ridesharing because it 's more fun than traveling alone on the train . “ i have had trips that were just a blast .
the people can be mixed in age and occupation , and everyone has different opinions , which makes the time just pass really quickly , ” she says . but , just like any car journey , there is always the possibility that break-downs or traffic jams can slow down a trip .
a couple of kathrin ’ s lifts have involved hours spent at the side of the motorway waiting for a mechanic to turn up . “ you can ’ t be in a hurry .
when you have to be somewhere on time , then it ’ s not always the best to go with a shared ride , ” she admits . another drawback is that passengers can be at the mercy of bad drivers .
andreas vierkötter used to work at a ridesharing agency , but the first time he used it to organize a lift for himself , was enough to put him off for ever . “ it was really , really bad .
i was terribly afraid of the lady ’ s driving style , and i decided that i would never ever do it again , ” he says . not a new thing ride-sharing agencies first started in germany in the mid-fifties .
by the 1970s , hundreds of official telephone agencies had sprouted up across the country .
the phone agencies still exist – but more and more people are turning to the internet because the service is cheaper -lrb- sometimes even free -rrb- and it ’ s more flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has connected those who drive and those who are just along for the ride .
although it 's difficult to know exactly how many people rideshare in germany , when mitfahrzentrale.de launched seven years ago , it only had a couple hundred users .
today , the figure has jumped to 650,000 users a month . one of the problems with the internet , however , is its anonymity .
at the telephone agencies , drivers have to leave a copy of their license in order to register .
the internet has no such controls . when martina becker first started ride-sharing 18 months ago she always gave her parents the license plate number and the driver ’ s phone number . “ i said , if i am dead , then this is who you ring , he ’ s the one who did it . ” martina says she has now stopped worrying , because she has never had a bad experience . ” everyone who rideshares is relatively normal , so i don ’ t feel funny about using it anymore , ” she says . gasoline prices driving up business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have increased the use of ridesharing in germany .
martina ’ s boyfriend tobias gutbrodt also rideshares , but as a driver , not as a passenger .
tobias studies in bonn and drives the 300km to his home town of karlsruhe nearly every weekend .
he says petrol prices are so high at the moment that he couldn ’ t afford to go home so often if he didn ’ t take along paying passengers . tobias isn ’ t alone in this .
when oil prices skyrocketed in august as a result of hurricane katrina , the number of people using mitfahrzentrale.de jumped by more than 15 percent . tobias says that even if gasoline was cheaper he would still put an ad in the internet because he gets to meet " really nice people . ” “ they are a very diverse lot – men , women , old , young , germans , and foreigners , ” he says .
but then tobias is perhaps a bit biased about ride-sharing because it ’ s how he and martina got together . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car sharing picks up speed once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .

the pds changed its name to the left party and struck an alliance with the wasg in july , and caused a surprise by taking 8.7 percent of the vote and 54 seats in the september elections , making it the fourth largest party in the bundestag . " the pds , the wasg and the new party will contribute to creating a democratic alternative to oppose the damage caused by neoliberalism to social cohesion , " left party leader lothar bisky told the 400 congress delegates .

while the former communists derive most of their backing in the east , the wasg , formed by deserters from the social democrats such as former finance minister oskar lafontaine in february , has its support base in the west . " we must unite to respect the desire of the electorate who voted for us , because without us there is not more left in parliament , " lafontaine said . many wasg members are however wary of a merger , fearing they will be swallowed up by the pds , which they accuse of not shaking off its communist past . stasi revelations dog the new left dawn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east 's secret past still dogs some of the region 's politicians .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

" this meeting will be very serious .
everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned talks - provisionally scheduled to take place in vienna on december 21 . " we expect this meeting to pay attention to the facts and iran 's rights .
we believe that we must be treated without discrimination .
we do n't want more than others and we wo n't settle for anything less , " he said . " the topic will be iran 's right to enrichment , " he added . eu-iran talks collapsed in august when tehran ended its suspension of uranium conversion , a first step towards enrichment , and the planned talks are aimed at exploring if an avenue for resuming negotiations is open . but the two sides remain totally deadlocked over the core issue of iran 's effort to master the entire nuclear fuel cycle - a process that culminates in the enrichment of uranium . iran argues peaceful nuclear energy a " right " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea director general mohamed elbaradei has to balance the claims of iran with proliferation fears .
as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , iran argues that fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes is a " right " .
but the process of enriching uranium can be extended to make weapons material can be extended to military purposes . the eu-3 - backed by the united states - want iran to give up such work as an " objective guarantee " it will not acquire weapons .
they want to push for a compromise under which iran 's enrichment work would be carried out in russia , although this has already been rejected by tehran . asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears to be out of the question . europeans hold the key , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus is on the likes of british foreign secretary jack straw and eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .
" it all depends on the european side and whether they enter the talks and give us our rights , " he said . the international atomic energy agency has said iran is not complying with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , which could lead to referral to the un security council and possible sanctions . tensions heightened over israel remarks the iaea last month put off such action after the eu-3 agreed to give time for russian diplomacy to work .
but the climate for talks has worsened after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad questioned the holocaust and suggested israel be relocated to europe .
in october he provoked a similar diplomatic storm after calling for israel to be " wiped off the map . " iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani has also warned that his country could soon resume making centrifuges - the devices used to enrich uranium - and conducting " research .

" we have reached legal security , " meaning it will not be possible in the future to sue the austrian state for individual compensation , schüssel said , after meeting president george w. bush at the white house . a lawsuit demanding compensation from austria for jews whose property was seized by nazis has been withdrawn , after the last 25 plaintiffs in the case each signed a statement to that effect , their lawyer jay fialkoff said . last month , a federal appeals court in new york dismissed the suit , acknowledging an argument from austria that it could not be subject to a ruling by a foreign court .
us government lawyers also argued that the suit ran counter to washington 's foreign policy interests . the parliament in vienna gave the green light to the payments in november ; as soon as a guarantee was given there would be no more legal battles . victims of nazi annexation to split compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of austrian jews were forced into labor camps and the property stolen .
over 20,000 austrian jews whose property was stolen by the nazis between 1938 -lrb- when hitler 's germany annexed austria -rrb- and the end of the war in 1945 , will now share the 210 million dollars made available by the state , the city of vienna , banks and insurance companies . agreements to that end were made in 2000 and 2001 between vienna and the jewish community but austria refused to implement them for lack of " legal security . " until 2000 austria , which saw itself as the first victim of the nazis thanks to an allied agreement describing it as such , had never paid any compensation to jewish victims , unlike germany . but after the " waldheim affair " - named after austria 's late president kurt waldheim -lrb- 1986-1992 -rrb- who was accused of hiding his activities with the wehrmacht , the german army - austria was strongly criticized and accused of hiding its past .
vienna reacted by initiating compensation payments in 2000 . the " national fund " which handles the distribution of financial means to the victims regretted that " some passed away before they could receive their due " . further restitutions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artworks stolen from austrian jews will be returned to survivors and relatives .
the restitution of buildings , houses and works of art which are still today public property , as well as the reconstruction in vienna of the pre-war jewish sports club , hakoah , are also planned . austria 's jews have as a community already received 9 million euros -lrb- 10.6 million dollars -rrb- in compensation for synagogues and buildings destroyed by the nazis , and are expected to receive a similar sum again soon . the jewish community in austria was one of the most thriving in central and eastern europe in the inter-war period , with intellectuals such as sigmund freud and writers such as arthur schnitzler and stefan zweig .
over 200,000 jews lived in austria in 1938 .
of those , 65,000 died at the hand of the nazis . today 's jewish community only has about 10,000 members left . final compensation will be third phase of payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors of the slave labor camps have been compensated .
two types of compensation have already been distributed in austria : 150 million euros -lrb- 177 million dollars -rrb- to jews who left valuables behind when they were thrown out of their rented flats by the nazis , and 352 million euros -lrb- 415 million dollars -rrb- for about 132,000 former slave labor victims who were forced to do back-breaking work in austria . the austrian daily der standard in a recent editorial referred to " the bitter realization that one can not make up for injustices of this nature with money and that all this -lrb- about 10,000 euros or 11,800 dollars per person -rrb- is much too little .

the pds changed its name to the left party and struck an alliance with the wasg in july , and caused a surprise by taking 8.7 percent of the vote and 54 seats in the september elections , making it the fourth largest party in the bundestag . " the pds , the wasg and the new party will contribute to creating a democratic alternative to oppose the damage caused by neoliberalism to social cohesion , " left party leader lothar bisky told the 400 congress delegates . " we must and will create a common leftist social party , which all germany needs , " added the head of the party 's parliamentary group , gregor gysi . the elections failed to give a clear majority to the outgoing ruling social democrats or the main opposition christian democrats , who ended up forming a coalition headed by christian democrat chancellor angela merkel . spd deserters and former communists cover bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi and lafontaine have the east and west covered with their politics .
while the former communists derive most of their backing in the east , the wasg , formed by deserters from the social democrats such as former finance minister oskar lafontaine in february , has its support base in the west . " we must unite to respect the desire of the electorate who voted for us , because without us there is not more left in parliament , " lafontaine said . many wasg members are however wary of a merger , fearing they will be swallowed up by the pds , which they accuse of not shaking off its communist past . stasi revelations dog the new left dawn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east 's secret past still dogs some of the region 's politicians .

we believe that we must be treated without discrimination .
we do n't want more than others and we wo n't settle for anything less , " he said .

they want to push for a compromise under which iran 's enrichment work would be carried out in russia , although this has already been rejected by tehran . asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears to be out of the question . europeans hold the key , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus is on the likes of british foreign secretary jack straw and eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .

but the climate for talks has worsened after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad questioned the holocaust and suggested israel be relocated to europe .
in october he provoked a similar diplomatic storm after calling for israel to be " wiped off the map .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2005 troubled northeast gets lift from new autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a -lrb- new -rrb- highway runs through it about 25 billion euros went to revamping transportation infrastructure in east germany after reunification .
after 11 years , and 2 billion euros , one of the biggest projects is finally finished . for decades , drivers had to endure the narrow streets leading through villages to get from east to west and back again .
but now all that is to change with the completion of germany 's transport-project number one , the 325 km long baltic sea motorway or a20 . the autobahn , which runs parallel to the baltic sea , connects the western german city of lübeck with stettin in poland and is being hailed as an economic boon to germany 's economically troubled northeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better access to the east " the baltic sea motorway is very important for our state , " said mecklenburg western-pomerania premier harald ringstorff .
" we did not have a single west-east- connection , but now we are going to benefit from the new a20 .
we already have a number of companies that settled along the motorway , it 's great for us and everyone who wants to come here .
tourism is booming now too , especially short-term tourism . "
worth the wait volker kock who oversees the project from the federal planning office says it took eleven years and 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- to build the four-lane a 20 , the fastest a motorway has been built in germany since the war .
it connects the main land with germany 's biggest island rügen .
it also plays a major role in european east-west-transport . " the a20 is part of the trans-european street network and that shows its importance : not only the connection from lübeck to stettin , but also the western link-up is now being discussed and planned , " he said .
" we are also looking east in the direction of poland and we have to see what is happening in the new eu-countries . " not everyone is happy about the construction of the a 20 .
environmentalists have accused the motorway project of causing the biggest destruction of green sites since german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the 2 billion euro autobahn took 11 years but politicians and engineers say they have given the environment a high priority by allocating 10 percent of the budget to environmental measures , adding that the motorway is necessary for the boost of the economically underdeveloped region .
still , it is not clear how much the economic impact on mecklenburg-west-pomerania will be . officials hope that effective marketing and less bureaucracy will help draw investment and jobs to state .
but instead , it could attract investors to stettin in poland where the wages are lower . kerstin winter and bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel takes heat out of russian gas deal in poland seeking to improve relations soured by plans to build a baltic gas pipeline between russia and europe , german chancellor angela merkel has promised she will not go over poland 's head in dealing with moscow .

it obtained 18.5 percent of votes in the 2002 general election . the proposal to drop the purification law split the country 's biggest party , the social democratic party , some of whose members lined up with the communists .
the communist party is the third-largest party in the lower house . the main opposition party voted against the proposal . prime minister stirs controversy social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek stirred up a storm of controversy and a rift within his party and the ruling coalition when he signalled last month that he would support the communist proposal . paroubek argued that 16 years after the velvet revolution that toppled the communist regime in 1989 , the law should be repealed since it had already fulfilled its function .
he later said there was no hurry for the law to be dropped . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prague apologizes for wwii expulsions the czech republic 's government made its first public statement of regret regarding the treatment and expulsion of anti-nazi czechoslovaks of german ethnicity after world war ii on wednesday .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

after 11 years , and 2 billion euros , one of the biggest projects is finally finished . for decades , drivers had to endure the narrow streets leading through villages to get from east to west and back again .
but now all that is to change with the completion of germany 's transport-project number one , the 325 km long baltic sea motorway or a20 . the autobahn , which runs parallel to the baltic sea , connects the western german city of lübeck with stettin in poland and is being hailed as an economic boon to germany 's economically troubled northeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better access to the east " the baltic sea motorway is very important for our state , " said mecklenburg western-pomerania premier harald ringstorff .
" we did not have a single west-east- connection , but now we are going to benefit from the new a20 .
we already have a number of companies that settled along the motorway , it 's great for us and everyone who wants to come here .
tourism is booming now too , especially short-term tourism . "
worth the wait volker kock who oversees the project from the federal planning office says it took eleven years and 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- to build the four-lane a 20 , the fastest a motorway has been built in germany since the war .
it connects the main land with germany 's biggest island rügen .
it also plays a major role in european east-west-transport . " the a20 is part of the trans-european street network and that shows its importance : not only the connection from lübeck to stettin , but also the western link-up is now being discussed and planned , " he said .
" we are also looking east in the direction of poland and we have to see what is happening in the new eu-countries . " not everyone is happy about the construction of the a 20 .
environmentalists have accused the motorway project of causing the biggest destruction of green sites since german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the 2 billion euro autobahn took 11 years but politicians and engineers say they have given the environment a high priority by allocating 10 percent of the budget to environmental measures , adding that the motorway is necessary for the boost of the economically underdeveloped region .
still , it is not clear how much the economic impact on mecklenburg-west-pomerania will be . officials hope that effective marketing and less bureaucracy will help draw investment and jobs to state .
but instead , it could attract investors to stettin in poland where the wages are lower . kerstin winter and bernd grässler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel takes heat out of russian gas deal in poland seeking to improve relations soured by plans to build a baltic gas pipeline between russia and europe , german chancellor angela merkel has promised she will not go over poland 's head in dealing with moscow .

then jump on the net and check out germany ’ s best kept travel secret - ridesharing . ridesharing , called mitfahren in german , links up drivers and passengers , and is the cheapest way to get around the country .

the pds changed its name to the left party and struck an alliance with the wasg in july , and caused a surprise by taking 8.7 percent of the vote and 54 seats in the september elections , making it the fourth largest party in the bundestag . " the pds , the wasg and the new party will contribute to creating a democratic alternative to oppose the damage caused by neoliberalism to social cohesion , " left party leader lothar bisky told the 400 congress delegates . " we must and will create a common leftist social party , which all germany needs , " added the head of the party 's parliamentary group , gregor gysi . the elections failed to give a clear majority to the outgoing ruling social democrats or the main opposition christian democrats , who ended up forming a coalition headed by christian democrat chancellor angela merkel . spd deserters and former communists cover bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi and lafontaine have the east and west covered with their politics .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

we believe that we must be treated without discrimination .
we do n't want more than others and we wo n't settle for anything less , " he said . " the topic will be iran 's right to enrichment , " he added . eu-iran talks collapsed in august when tehran ended its suspension of uranium conversion , a first step towards enrichment , and the planned talks are aimed at exploring if an avenue for resuming negotiations is open . but the two sides remain totally deadlocked over the core issue of iran 's effort to master the entire nuclear fuel cycle - a process that culminates in the enrichment of uranium . iran argues peaceful nuclear energy a " right " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea director general mohamed elbaradei has to balance the claims of iran with proliferation fears .

they want to push for a compromise under which iran 's enrichment work would be carried out in russia , although this has already been rejected by tehran . asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears to be out of the question . europeans hold the key , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the onus is on the likes of british foreign secretary jack straw and eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .
" it all depends on the european side and whether they enter the talks and give us our rights , " he said . the international atomic energy agency has said iran is not complying with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , which could lead to referral to the un security council and possible sanctions . tensions heightened over israel remarks the iaea last month put off such action after the eu-3 agreed to give time for russian diplomacy to work .
but the climate for talks has worsened after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad questioned the holocaust and suggested israel be relocated to europe .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

it obtained 18.5 percent of votes in the 2002 general election . the proposal to drop the purification law split the country 's biggest party , the social democratic party , some of whose members lined up with the communists .
the communist party is the third-largest party in the lower house . the main opposition party voted against the proposal . prime minister stirs controversy social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek stirred up a storm of controversy and a rift within his party and the ruling coalition when he signalled last month that he would support the communist proposal . paroubek argued that 16 years after the velvet revolution that toppled the communist regime in 1989 , the law should be repealed since it had already fulfilled its function .
he later said there was no hurry for the law to be dropped . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prague apologizes for wwii expulsions the czech republic 's government made its first public statement of regret regarding the treatment and expulsion of anti-nazi czechoslovaks of german ethnicity after world war ii on wednesday .

the pds changed its name to the left party and struck an alliance with the wasg in july , and caused a surprise by taking 8.7 percent of the vote and 54 seats in the september elections , making it the fourth largest party in the bundestag . " the pds , the wasg and the new party will contribute to creating a democratic alternative to oppose the damage caused by neoliberalism to social cohesion , " left party leader lothar bisky told the 400 congress delegates . " we must and will create a common leftist social party , which all germany needs , " added the head of the party 's parliamentary group , gregor gysi . the elections failed to give a clear majority to the outgoing ruling social democrats or the main opposition christian democrats , who ended up forming a coalition headed by christian democrat chancellor angela merkel . spd deserters and former communists cover bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi and lafontaine have the east and west covered with their politics .
while the former communists derive most of their backing in the east , the wasg , formed by deserters from the social democrats such as former finance minister oskar lafontaine in february , has its support base in the west . " we must unite to respect the desire of the electorate who voted for us , because without us there is not more left in parliament , " lafontaine said . many wasg members are however wary of a merger , fearing they will be swallowed up by the pds , which they accuse of not shaking off its communist past . stasi revelations dog the new left dawn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east 's secret past still dogs some of the region 's politicians .
the past came back to haunt one of the party 's members on saturday , when bernhard walther revealed he was listed as an informer for the stasi , the east german secret police , sparking vociferous questioning . although walther said his listing was a formality because of his position in an import-export company , he decided in the end not to take the position of treasurer , despite winning a large majority . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de left party not yet out of the power game the left party was the only contender in the german polls who could claim a full victory , winning 8.7 percent of votes in their first bid for power .

" we have reached legal security , " meaning it will not be possible in the future to sue the austrian state for individual compensation , schüssel said , after meeting president george w. bush at the white house . a lawsuit demanding compensation from austria for jews whose property was seized by nazis has been withdrawn , after the last 25 plaintiffs in the case each signed a statement to that effect , their lawyer jay fialkoff said . last month , a federal appeals court in new york dismissed the suit , acknowledging an argument from austria that it could not be subject to a ruling by a foreign court .

" until 2000 austria , which saw itself as the first victim of the nazis thanks to an allied agreement describing it as such , had never paid any compensation to jewish victims , unlike germany . but after the " waldheim affair " - named after austria 's late president kurt waldheim -lrb- 1986-1992 -rrb- who was accused of hiding his activities with the wehrmacht , the german army - austria was strongly criticized and accused of hiding its past .
vienna reacted by initiating compensation payments in 2000 . the " national fund " which handles the distribution of financial means to the victims regretted that " some passed away before they could receive their due " . further restitutions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artworks stolen from austrian jews will be returned to survivors and relatives .
the restitution of buildings , houses and works of art which are still today public property , as well as the reconstruction in vienna of the pre-war jewish sports club , hakoah , are also planned . austria 's jews have as a community already received 9 million euros -lrb- 10.6 million dollars -rrb- in compensation for synagogues and buildings destroyed by the nazis , and are expected to receive a similar sum again soon . the jewish community in austria was one of the most thriving in central and eastern europe in the inter-war period , with intellectuals such as sigmund freud and writers such as arthur schnitzler and stefan zweig .
over 200,000 jews lived in austria in 1938 .
of those , 65,000 died at the hand of the nazis . today 's jewish community only has about 10,000 members left . final compensation will be third phase of payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors of the slave labor camps have been compensated .
two types of compensation have already been distributed in austria : 150 million euros -lrb- 177 million dollars -rrb- to jews who left valuables behind when they were thrown out of their rented flats by the nazis , and 352 million euros -lrb- 415 million dollars -rrb- for about 132,000 former slave labor victims who were forced to do back-breaking work in austria . the austrian daily der standard in a recent editorial referred to " the bitter realization that one can not make up for injustices of this nature with money and that all this -lrb- about 10,000 euros or 11,800 dollars per person -rrb- is much too little .

" we have reached legal security , " meaning it will not be possible in the future to sue the austrian state for individual compensation , schüssel said , after meeting president george w. bush at the white house . a lawsuit demanding compensation from austria for jews whose property was seized by nazis has been withdrawn , after the last 25 plaintiffs in the case each signed a statement to that effect , their lawyer jay fialkoff said . last month , a federal appeals court in new york dismissed the suit , acknowledging an argument from austria that it could not be subject to a ruling by a foreign court .
us government lawyers also argued that the suit ran counter to washington 's foreign policy interests . the parliament in vienna gave the green light to the payments in november ; as soon as a guarantee was given there would be no more legal battles . victims of nazi annexation to split compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of austrian jews were forced into labor camps and the property stolen .
over 20,000 austrian jews whose property was stolen by the nazis between 1938 -lrb- when hitler 's germany annexed austria -rrb- and the end of the war in 1945 , will now share the 210 million dollars made available by the state , the city of vienna , banks and insurance companies . agreements to that end were made in 2000 and 2001 between vienna and the jewish community but austria refused to implement them for lack of " legal security . " until 2000 austria , which saw itself as the first victim of the nazis thanks to an allied agreement describing it as such , had never paid any compensation to jewish victims , unlike germany . but after the " waldheim affair " - named after austria 's late president kurt waldheim -lrb- 1986-1992 -rrb- who was accused of hiding his activities with the wehrmacht , the german army - austria was strongly criticized and accused of hiding its past .
vienna reacted by initiating compensation payments in 2000 . the " national fund " which handles the distribution of financial means to the victims regretted that " some passed away before they could receive their due " . further restitutions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artworks stolen from austrian jews will be returned to survivors and relatives .
the restitution of buildings , houses and works of art which are still today public property , as well as the reconstruction in vienna of the pre-war jewish sports club , hakoah , are also planned . austria 's jews have as a community already received 9 million euros -lrb- 10.6 million dollars -rrb- in compensation for synagogues and buildings destroyed by the nazis , and are expected to receive a similar sum again soon . the jewish community in austria was one of the most thriving in central and eastern europe in the inter-war period , with intellectuals such as sigmund freud and writers such as arthur schnitzler and stefan zweig .
over 200,000 jews lived in austria in 1938 .
of those , 65,000 died at the hand of the nazis . today 's jewish community only has about 10,000 members left . final compensation will be third phase of payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors of the slave labor camps have been compensated .
two types of compensation have already been distributed in austria : 150 million euros -lrb- 177 million dollars -rrb- to jews who left valuables behind when they were thrown out of their rented flats by the nazis , and 352 million euros -lrb- 415 million dollars -rrb- for about 132,000 former slave labor victims who were forced to do back-breaking work in austria . the austrian daily der standard in a recent editorial referred to " the bitter realization that one can not make up for injustices of this nature with money and that all this -lrb- about 10,000 euros or 11,800 dollars per person -rrb- is much too little . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belated recognition for forced laborers the international organization for migration has just completed final compensation payments to more than 80,000 survivors of slave and forced labor under the nazis in world war ii .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

it obtained 18.5 percent of votes in the 2002 general election . the proposal to drop the purification law split the country 's biggest party , the social democratic party , some of whose members lined up with the communists .
the communist party is the third-largest party in the lower house . the main opposition party voted against the proposal . prime minister stirs controversy social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek stirred up a storm of controversy and a rift within his party and the ruling coalition when he signalled last month that he would support the communist proposal . paroubek argued that 16 years after the velvet revolution that toppled the communist regime in 1989 , the law should be repealed since it had already fulfilled its function .
he later said there was no hurry for the law to be dropped . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prague apologizes for wwii expulsions the czech republic 's government made its first public statement of regret regarding the treatment and expulsion of anti-nazi czechoslovaks of german ethnicity after world war ii on wednesday .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past . " the mission said the september 18 elections for the lower house of parliament and provincial councils were an " accomplishment " although there were some shortcomings , including irregularities and fraud . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to assist with afghan elections for the first time since the fall of the taliban regime , afghanistan will elect its parliament on sept .

" however they should not be viewed as ' the end of the story ' , " said the report by the eu mission which observed the september 18 legislative elections .
" several risk factors threaten to undermine democratic development in afghanistan , " it said . these included widespread corruption , pervasive illegal opium production and " continued lack of security and stability in parts of the country including continued presence of illegal armed groups , " it said . the three were strongly interlinked .
" for example , the illegal opium economy funds illegal armed groups and feeds corruption , " the report said . drugs , violence and a breeding ground for extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban insurgency is suspected of being financed by opium sales .
afghanistan is estimated to produce more than 80 percent of the world 's supply of opium , used to make heroin , despite efforts by the government .
it is also plagued by regular attacks by islamic militants , notably those linked to the extremist taliban government removed from power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 .
the violence has killed about 1,500 people this year . and despite government disarmament programs , several former warlords still run private armies in remote areas which have yet to come under the control of the central government . the sitting of the new parliament , due on december 19 , will mark the end of an internationally planned transition to democracy that was adopted at a conference in bonn , germany after the taliban were routed . bonn process making its mark slowly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un organized round table talks on afghanistan in bonn in 2001 made stability a priority .
the eu report said the main achievements of the bonn process included the elections and laying down basic foundations for state structures . however there were several weaknesses , such as limited international assistance on security , not enough time spent on reconciliation and the fact that civic education had focused largely on voting and not aspects of democracy-building such as national unity and the rule of law . the report urged the government to include ways to build democracy in its development strategy , including a " compact for afghanistan " to be presented to a london conference next month to plan a " post-bonn " process . international involvement likely to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces may be required in afghanistan for some time to come .
" continued international engagement in support of security , economic and social development with focus on social cohesion in addition to local empowerment and public participation are important to underpin a solid democracy-building in afghanistan , " the report said . a well-functioning democratic system was " a valuable safeguard against a return to afghanistan 's brutal recent past .

chances are someone is going your way want to travel from berlin to cologne , but can ’ t afford the train fare and don ’ t feel like hitchhiking ?
then jump on the net and check out germany ’ s best kept travel secret - ridesharing . ridesharing , called mitfahren in german , links up drivers and passengers , and is the cheapest way to get around the country .
drivers usually charge about five euros per hundred kilometers , which is significantly cheaper than the train . there are thousands of agencies online , but the two biggest are mitfahrzentrale.de and mitfahrgelegenheiten.de.
they are simple to use - you just have to put in your departure point , your destination and the date of travel .
with a couple of mouse clicks and a bit of luck , you can locate a driver and then e-mail , text message or simply ring up to see if there 's still a seat in the car . kathrin matzen , who uses ridesharing about once a month to visit friends across germany , as well as in neighboring belgium , france and the netherlands , says that she has never had a problem organizing a lift , and that the whole thing is “ incredibly easy . ” just like any road trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers and travelers reap the benefits .
in addition to saving money and helping to protect the environment through less pollution , kathrin says she likes ridesharing because it 's more fun than traveling alone on the train . “ i have had trips that were just a blast .
the people can be mixed in age and occupation , and everyone has different opinions , which makes the time just pass really quickly , ” she says . but , just like any car journey , there is always the possibility that break-downs or traffic jams can slow down a trip .
a couple of kathrin ’ s lifts have involved hours spent at the side of the motorway waiting for a mechanic to turn up . “ you can ’ t be in a hurry .
when you have to be somewhere on time , then it ’ s not always the best to go with a shared ride , ” she admits . another drawback is that passengers can be at the mercy of bad drivers .
andreas vierkötter used to work at a ridesharing agency , but the first time he used it to organize a lift for himself , was enough to put him off for ever . “ it was really , really bad .
i was terribly afraid of the lady ’ s driving style , and i decided that i would never ever do it again , ” he says . not a new thing ride-sharing agencies first started in germany in the mid-fifties .

although it 's difficult to know exactly how many people rideshare in germany , when mitfahrzentrale.de launched seven years ago , it only had a couple hundred users .

the internet has no such controls . when martina becker first started ride-sharing 18 months ago she always gave her parents the license plate number and the driver ’ s phone number . “ i said , if i am dead , then this is who you ring , he ’ s the one who did it . ” martina says she has now stopped worrying , because she has never had a bad experience . ” everyone who rideshares is relatively normal , so i don ’ t feel funny about using it anymore , ” she says . gasoline prices driving up business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have increased the use of ridesharing in germany .
martina ’ s boyfriend tobias gutbrodt also rideshares , but as a driver , not as a passenger .
tobias studies in bonn and drives the 300km to his home town of karlsruhe nearly every weekend .
he says petrol prices are so high at the moment that he couldn ’ t afford to go home so often if he didn ’ t take along paying passengers . tobias isn ’ t alone in this .
when oil prices skyrocketed in august as a result of hurricane katrina , the number of people using mitfahrzentrale.de jumped by more than 15 percent . tobias says that even if gasoline was cheaper he would still put an ad in the internet because he gets to meet " really nice people . ” “ they are a very diverse lot – men , women , old , young , germans , and foreigners , ” he says .

it obtained 18.5 percent of votes in the 2002 general election . the proposal to drop the purification law split the country 's biggest party , the social democratic party , some of whose members lined up with the communists .
the communist party is the third-largest party in the lower house . the main opposition party voted against the proposal . prime minister stirs controversy social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek stirred up a storm of controversy and a rift within his party and the ruling coalition when he signalled last month that he would support the communist proposal . paroubek argued that 16 years after the velvet revolution that toppled the communist regime in 1989 , the law should be repealed since it had already fulfilled its function .

after 11 years , and 2 billion euros , one of the biggest projects is finally finished . for decades , drivers had to endure the narrow streets leading through villages to get from east to west and back again .
but now all that is to change with the completion of germany 's transport-project number one , the 325 km long baltic sea motorway or a20 . the autobahn , which runs parallel to the baltic sea , connects the western german city of lübeck with stettin in poland and is being hailed as an economic boon to germany 's economically troubled northeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better access to the east " the baltic sea motorway is very important for our state , " said mecklenburg western-pomerania premier harald ringstorff .

we already have a number of companies that settled along the motorway , it 's great for us and everyone who wants to come here .

worth the wait volker kock who oversees the project from the federal planning office says it took eleven years and 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- to build the four-lane a 20 , the fastest a motorway has been built in germany since the war .
it connects the main land with germany 's biggest island rügen .
it also plays a major role in european east-west-transport . " the a20 is part of the trans-european street network and that shows its importance : not only the connection from lübeck to stettin , but also the western link-up is now being discussed and planned , " he said .
" we are also looking east in the direction of poland and we have to see what is happening in the new eu-countries . " not everyone is happy about the construction of the a 20 .
environmentalists have accused the motorway project of causing the biggest destruction of green sites since german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the 2 billion euro autobahn took 11 years but politicians and engineers say they have given the environment a high priority by allocating 10 percent of the budget to environmental measures , adding that the motorway is necessary for the boost of the economically underdeveloped region .

then jump on the net and check out germany ’ s best kept travel secret - ridesharing . ridesharing , called mitfahren in german , links up drivers and passengers , and is the cheapest way to get around the country .
drivers usually charge about five euros per hundred kilometers , which is significantly cheaper than the train . there are thousands of agencies online , but the two biggest are mitfahrzentrale.de and mitfahrgelegenheiten.de.
they are simple to use - you just have to put in your departure point , your destination and the date of travel .
with a couple of mouse clicks and a bit of luck , you can locate a driver and then e-mail , text message or simply ring up to see if there 's still a seat in the car . kathrin matzen , who uses ridesharing about once a month to visit friends across germany , as well as in neighboring belgium , france and the netherlands , says that she has never had a problem organizing a lift , and that the whole thing is “ incredibly easy . ” just like any road trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers and travelers reap the benefits .
in addition to saving money and helping to protect the environment through less pollution , kathrin says she likes ridesharing because it 's more fun than traveling alone on the train . “ i have had trips that were just a blast .
the people can be mixed in age and occupation , and everyone has different opinions , which makes the time just pass really quickly , ” she says . but , just like any car journey , there is always the possibility that break-downs or traffic jams can slow down a trip .

when you have to be somewhere on time , then it ’ s not always the best to go with a shared ride , ” she admits . another drawback is that passengers can be at the mercy of bad drivers .
andreas vierkötter used to work at a ridesharing agency , but the first time he used it to organize a lift for himself , was enough to put him off for ever . “ it was really , really bad .

then jump on the net and check out germany ’ s best kept travel secret - ridesharing . ridesharing , called mitfahren in german , links up drivers and passengers , and is the cheapest way to get around the country .
drivers usually charge about five euros per hundred kilometers , which is significantly cheaper than the train . there are thousands of agencies online , but the two biggest are mitfahrzentrale.de and mitfahrgelegenheiten.de.
they are simple to use - you just have to put in your departure point , your destination and the date of travel .
with a couple of mouse clicks and a bit of luck , you can locate a driver and then e-mail , text message or simply ring up to see if there 's still a seat in the car . kathrin matzen , who uses ridesharing about once a month to visit friends across germany , as well as in neighboring belgium , france and the netherlands , says that she has never had a problem organizing a lift , and that the whole thing is “ incredibly easy . ” just like any road trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers and travelers reap the benefits .
in addition to saving money and helping to protect the environment through less pollution , kathrin says she likes ridesharing because it 's more fun than traveling alone on the train . “ i have had trips that were just a blast .
the people can be mixed in age and occupation , and everyone has different opinions , which makes the time just pass really quickly , ” she says . but , just like any car journey , there is always the possibility that break-downs or traffic jams can slow down a trip .
a couple of kathrin ’ s lifts have involved hours spent at the side of the motorway waiting for a mechanic to turn up . “ you can ’ t be in a hurry .
when you have to be somewhere on time , then it ’ s not always the best to go with a shared ride , ” she admits . another drawback is that passengers can be at the mercy of bad drivers .
andreas vierkötter used to work at a ridesharing agency , but the first time he used it to organize a lift for himself , was enough to put him off for ever . “ it was really , really bad .
i was terribly afraid of the lady ’ s driving style , and i decided that i would never ever do it again , ” he says . not a new thing ride-sharing agencies first started in germany in the mid-fifties .
by the 1970s , hundreds of official telephone agencies had sprouted up across the country .
the phone agencies still exist – but more and more people are turning to the internet because the service is cheaper -lrb- sometimes even free -rrb- and it ’ s more flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has connected those who drive and those who are just along for the ride .
although it 's difficult to know exactly how many people rideshare in germany , when mitfahrzentrale.de launched seven years ago , it only had a couple hundred users .
today , the figure has jumped to 650,000 users a month . one of the problems with the internet , however , is its anonymity .
at the telephone agencies , drivers have to leave a copy of their license in order to register .
the internet has no such controls . when martina becker first started ride-sharing 18 months ago she always gave her parents the license plate number and the driver ’ s phone number . “ i said , if i am dead , then this is who you ring , he ’ s the one who did it . ” martina says she has now stopped worrying , because she has never had a bad experience . ” everyone who rideshares is relatively normal , so i don ’ t feel funny about using it anymore , ” she says . gasoline prices driving up business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have increased the use of ridesharing in germany .
martina ’ s boyfriend tobias gutbrodt also rideshares , but as a driver , not as a passenger .
tobias studies in bonn and drives the 300km to his home town of karlsruhe nearly every weekend .
he says petrol prices are so high at the moment that he couldn ’ t afford to go home so often if he didn ’ t take along paying passengers . tobias isn ’ t alone in this .
when oil prices skyrocketed in august as a result of hurricane katrina , the number of people using mitfahrzentrale.de jumped by more than 15 percent . tobias says that even if gasoline was cheaper he would still put an ad in the internet because he gets to meet " really nice people . ” “ they are a very diverse lot – men , women , old , young , germans , and foreigners , ” he says .
but then tobias is perhaps a bit biased about ride-sharing because it ’ s how he and martina got together . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car sharing picks up speed once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .

chances are someone is going your way want to travel from berlin to cologne , but can ’ t afford the train fare and don ’ t feel like hitchhiking ?
then jump on the net and check out germany ’ s best kept travel secret - ridesharing . ridesharing , called mitfahren in german , links up drivers and passengers , and is the cheapest way to get around the country .
drivers usually charge about five euros per hundred kilometers , which is significantly cheaper than the train . there are thousands of agencies online , but the two biggest are mitfahrzentrale.de and mitfahrgelegenheiten.de.
they are simple to use - you just have to put in your departure point , your destination and the date of travel .
with a couple of mouse clicks and a bit of luck , you can locate a driver and then e-mail , text message or simply ring up to see if there 's still a seat in the car . kathrin matzen , who uses ridesharing about once a month to visit friends across germany , as well as in neighboring belgium , france and the netherlands , says that she has never had a problem organizing a lift , and that the whole thing is “ incredibly easy . ” just like any road trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers and travelers reap the benefits .
in addition to saving money and helping to protect the environment through less pollution , kathrin says she likes ridesharing because it 's more fun than traveling alone on the train . “ i have had trips that were just a blast .
the people can be mixed in age and occupation , and everyone has different opinions , which makes the time just pass really quickly , ” she says . but , just like any car journey , there is always the possibility that break-downs or traffic jams can slow down a trip .
a couple of kathrin ’ s lifts have involved hours spent at the side of the motorway waiting for a mechanic to turn up . “ you can ’ t be in a hurry .
when you have to be somewhere on time , then it ’ s not always the best to go with a shared ride , ” she admits . another drawback is that passengers can be at the mercy of bad drivers .
andreas vierkötter used to work at a ridesharing agency , but the first time he used it to organize a lift for himself , was enough to put him off for ever . “ it was really , really bad .
i was terribly afraid of the lady ’ s driving style , and i decided that i would never ever do it again , ” he says . not a new thing ride-sharing agencies first started in germany in the mid-fifties .
by the 1970s , hundreds of official telephone agencies had sprouted up across the country .
the phone agencies still exist – but more and more people are turning to the internet because the service is cheaper -lrb- sometimes even free -rrb- and it ’ s more flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has connected those who drive and those who are just along for the ride .
although it 's difficult to know exactly how many people rideshare in germany , when mitfahrzentrale.de launched seven years ago , it only had a couple hundred users .
today , the figure has jumped to 650,000 users a month . one of the problems with the internet , however , is its anonymity .
at the telephone agencies , drivers have to leave a copy of their license in order to register .
the internet has no such controls . when martina becker first started ride-sharing 18 months ago she always gave her parents the license plate number and the driver ’ s phone number . “ i said , if i am dead , then this is who you ring , he ’ s the one who did it . ” martina says she has now stopped worrying , because she has never had a bad experience . ” everyone who rideshares is relatively normal , so i don ’ t feel funny about using it anymore , ” she says . gasoline prices driving up business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising gas prices have increased the use of ridesharing in germany .
martina ’ s boyfriend tobias gutbrodt also rideshares , but as a driver , not as a passenger .
tobias studies in bonn and drives the 300km to his home town of karlsruhe nearly every weekend .
he says petrol prices are so high at the moment that he couldn ’ t afford to go home so often if he didn ’ t take along paying passengers . tobias isn ’ t alone in this .
when oil prices skyrocketed in august as a result of hurricane katrina , the number of people using mitfahrzentrale.de jumped by more than 15 percent . tobias says that even if gasoline was cheaper he would still put an ad in the internet because he gets to meet " really nice people . ” “ they are a very diverse lot – men , women , old , young , germans , and foreigners , ” he says .

" we have reached legal security , " meaning it will not be possible in the future to sue the austrian state for individual compensation , schüssel said , after meeting president george w. bush at the white house . a lawsuit demanding compensation from austria for jews whose property was seized by nazis has been withdrawn , after the last 25 plaintiffs in the case each signed a statement to that effect , their lawyer jay fialkoff said . last month , a federal appeals court in new york dismissed the suit , acknowledging an argument from austria that it could not be subject to a ruling by a foreign court .
us government lawyers also argued that the suit ran counter to washington 's foreign policy interests . the parliament in vienna gave the green light to the payments in november ; as soon as a guarantee was given there would be no more legal battles . victims of nazi annexation to split compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of austrian jews were forced into labor camps and the property stolen .
over 20,000 austrian jews whose property was stolen by the nazis between 1938 -lrb- when hitler 's germany annexed austria -rrb- and the end of the war in 1945 , will now share the 210 million dollars made available by the state , the city of vienna , banks and insurance companies . agreements to that end were made in 2000 and 2001 between vienna and the jewish community but austria refused to implement them for lack of " legal security . " until 2000 austria , which saw itself as the first victim of the nazis thanks to an allied agreement describing it as such , had never paid any compensation to jewish victims , unlike germany . but after the " waldheim affair " - named after austria 's late president kurt waldheim -lrb- 1986-1992 -rrb- who was accused of hiding his activities with the wehrmacht , the german army - austria was strongly criticized and accused of hiding its past .
vienna reacted by initiating compensation payments in 2000 . the " national fund " which handles the distribution of financial means to the victims regretted that " some passed away before they could receive their due " . further restitutions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artworks stolen from austrian jews will be returned to survivors and relatives .
the restitution of buildings , houses and works of art which are still today public property , as well as the reconstruction in vienna of the pre-war jewish sports club , hakoah , are also planned . austria 's jews have as a community already received 9 million euros -lrb- 10.6 million dollars -rrb- in compensation for synagogues and buildings destroyed by the nazis , and are expected to receive a similar sum again soon . the jewish community in austria was one of the most thriving in central and eastern europe in the inter-war period , with intellectuals such as sigmund freud and writers such as arthur schnitzler and stefan zweig .
over 200,000 jews lived in austria in 1938 .
of those , 65,000 died at the hand of the nazis . today 's jewish community only has about 10,000 members left . final compensation will be third phase of payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors of the slave labor camps have been compensated .
two types of compensation have already been distributed in austria : 150 million euros -lrb- 177 million dollars -rrb- to jews who left valuables behind when they were thrown out of their rented flats by the nazis , and 352 million euros -lrb- 415 million dollars -rrb- for about 132,000 former slave labor victims who were forced to do back-breaking work in austria . the austrian daily der standard in a recent editorial referred to " the bitter realization that one can not make up for injustices of this nature with money and that all this -lrb- about 10,000 euros or 11,800 dollars per person -rrb- is much too little .

we started receiving your comments shortly after 6 o 'clock this morning .
click here to send us your comments .
there was a clear blue sky over high wycombe this morning - now it has been blacked out by the fumes from hemel hempstead .
john ley , high wycombe , bucks my house shook at 6.03am and i live in slough !
i can not imagine what it would have been like for people closer to the epicentre .
sam , slough , uk i was in my bedroom / office getting ready for work in aldgate .
all of a sudden the whole room just shook and actually appeared to tip .
a good 5 or 6 seconds later there was a terrifying explosion .
i looked out of the window to see a huge fireball light the sky which must have been up to 200 ft high .
i incorrectly assumed a local forecourt garage had exploded -lrb- buncefield is about a mile away from my home -rrb- mike napthine , hemel hempstead the blast woke me and the wife 16 miles away in north luton , i thought it was thunder or a plane breaking the sound barrier doug stephen , luton hi my name is taryn , my dad is a texaco tank driver .
he was at the scene when he pulled up outside the depot gate and then the explosion happened .
he was not hurt in anyway as the gate was quite a drive before you get to the tanks .
the rumour that is around is that a tank leaked and caught fire some how , then spread to the tanks beside it , full with petrol and exploded. age : 10 taryn , nth bushey and england i live about 3.5 miles from where the explosion .
the 1st explosion woke me up from the massive shake and the loud bang .
i heard the two other explosions which had not such a loud bang .
all that i can see in the sky is black from the smoke and orange from the sun mixed with the smoke .
philippa philippa carr , hemel hempstead , england just arrived at my office , at about six i was about to unlock , when the office door rattled and at the same time i heard about four low booming sounds , which i though was the army firing at their thetford firing range which we here up in norwich , and thought nothing more about it until your news flash on our companies pcs robert starling , norwich norfolk whilst getting ready for work this morning , i heard a loud rumble , like distant thunder .
then at the same time as the noise happened , my back door flew open .
i seriously thought there had been an earth tremor .
most of my colleagues at work heard it also elaine ward , reading we felt something first and i jumped out of bed just as i heard the blast .
the birds were flying in all directions .
we thought it must have been an explosion on the industrial estate and are shocked to find it is so far away .
teresa price , high wycombe , bucks we were awake at 6am and heard two distant bangs at about the time of the explosions .
felixstowe is 80miles from hemel hempstead .
robert shaw , felixstowe , suffolk the sky lit up orange my windows were open so we went to have a look but couldn ¿ t get any were near but there were people crying saying i know people who are in there .
jason fuller , hemel hempstead i was at my mates in highfield playing on their ps2 and suddenly i saw a bright light then a massive bang .
suddenly the house shock i woke my mate lee up and then his mum shout boys get up there ¿ s been an explosion so me and my mates ran outside towards the oil depo .
i managed to get up to the nikkie line near exel but at that point the heat n smell was unbearable so i returned my friend filmed footage on his phone. ben , hemel hempstead i was woken up just after 6.00 a.m. by what sounded like a large rumble - it felt very strange - i thought it was an earthquake .
judy palmer , princes risborough , bucks i heard what i thought was two claps of thunder and the radiator shock on the wall .
kevin pitcher , aylesbury we were woken by the explosion at 6am .
we could n't believe how loud it was , especially when we heard how far away it was .
rob griffiths , beaconsfield , bucks was puzzled when i heard what i thought was thunder as i dozed .
this is n't the right kind of weather i realised , maybe i would n't get out on my bike this morning .
stewart coulter , uxbridge , middx .
i heard this earlier this morning we a fair distance away from the refinery nearly in oxford , i had just got my 12 month old back to bed just after 6 and i head a bang and sort of shock wave over the house and it was not till we got up at 7.30 we saw the news . and put 2 and 2 together .
chris warren , haddenham , bucks woken by explosion at 0555 !
very loud low thud .
joe t , staines i am a student at brunel university i did hear the explosion and i woke up at 0620 it was a massive explosion the room shook .
ahmad nasir , uxbridge i heard / felt what i initially thought was a minor earthquake at approximately 6am .
i decided to search the news in an attempt to confirm and realized i had heard the initial explosion of the fuel depot .
hard to believe that it was heard and felt all the way here in oxfordshire .
michel ouellette , bicester , oxfordshire woke us up this morning and initially put the " bang " down to a freak thunder clap .
finally got up just after 7 am to find that the trap door to our loft had dropped down - therefore assumed that was the noise .
tuned in to news24 -lrb- as usual -rrb- to see the reports about the buncefield explosion .
it would appear that at 5.5 miles away the shock wave was still strong enough to cause a pressure drop in the loft which released the loft door catch .
i can only imagine what it must have been like for those far closer than ourselves .
derek hawtin , harpenden , herts i live 10 miles away from hemel and i was woken with a start when the first explosion went off .
the whole house reverberated and the vibration of the garage doors made a very loud noise .
my first reaction was that it was a bomb .
paul emery , chesham bucks we heard a loud bang in high wycombe at around 06.00am and even now you can smell fumes .

outside neighbours , were scampering around in night clothes and we spotted a massive fire towards the buncefield oil depot 1 mile up the m1 .
flames and smoke plumed and shot upwards leaving a blanket of smoke heading over us and st albans .
this was followed by three further minor explosions .
other neighbours have lost pieces of boarding , front doors have come off their hinges and allegedly some windows have been blown out .
there exists a strange other-worldly camaraderie that must be reminiscent of the blitz .
one neighbour claimed that a helicopter or plane had been seen minutes before the explosion but this is sketchy .
all the neighbours are shaky and ringing loved ones .
the flames and smoke have not subsided and it will be a few days before the flames are likely to be put on - anyone know red adair 's phone number ?
