the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .

for a decade now , borderless travel through 12 eu states has been a reality , thanks to the schengen agreement . it finally happened on march 26 , 1995 .
" we 've now succeeded in completely doing away with borders , " proclaimed former dutch defense minister wim van eekelen .
ten years ago , in the tiny luxembourgian border town of schengen , the treaty signed by france , germany and the benelux countries came into effect , making borderless travel possible . since then , thousands of tourists have made a point of visiting the tiny village .
there , they find a memorial , and now , a small info-center .
mayor roger weber is pleased that schengen has achieved international recognition because of its association with travel freedom . " sure , we 're proud that the agreement was signed in schengen , " he beams .
" it was actually more of a coincidence , but we 're happy that it happened here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to schengen back then , officials were on the lookout for a border crossing for the five founding states : germany , france , belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg .
since luxembourg was holding the rotating eu council presidency at the time , the choice fell on the tiny village on the mosel river .
the introduction of total freedom of travel was an experiment , beyond the actual agreements of the european union . at the core of the eu identity now , schengen belongs to the core of the european identity .
twelve of the 25 eu states have signed the agreement .
hardly any eu citizens have to show their papers at the eu 's borders these days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.03.2005 church breaks silence on " da vinci code " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal bertone : " do n't buy this book " rarely before have people read so much about jesus .
the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .
there could be no talk of a boycott appeal on the part of the vatican . oliver samson -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oh lord , what freaks !

for several years in the early 1990s , construction companies are said to have paid 90 million euros -lrb- $ 116 million -rrb- in bribes , swelling the coffers of political parties .
their reward : contracts to build and maintain secondary schools in the paris area . and yet again , the trials involve president chirac when he served as mayor of paris and his allies , politicians from the entire spectrum .
mr chirac invoked presidential immunity to escape investigation over other affairs , but his allies did n't have that option .

smartly dressed in a pin-striped suit , with an aristocratic air about him but still mild mannered , you would recognize him as a businessman , but you would not necessarily know that he is managing billions of dollars for lone star capital , a private equity company from dallas , texas . perhaps unlike one of the lone star state ’ s more high-profile cowboys of the moment , george w. bush , lone star capital likes to spend time in germany .
a lot .
or better said : lone star likes germany ’ s bad loans , in the industry referred to as npls - nonperforming loans , and there are a lot of those .
german banks are dumping the npls onto the market in record numbers .
not individually , but in packages or portfolios whose files are so valuable that they are transported with a police escort from one german city to the next after a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hypovereinsbank and its real estate subsidiary , hypo real estate , are purging themselves of their nonperforming loans the financial institutions are happy to purge them .
“ they can quickly clean up their balance sheets and get a shot of extra liquidity , ” said michael hüther , director of the institute for the german economy in cologne .
the sums involved are by no means miniscule . billions of euros waiting to be harvested last september , the hypo real estate bank jettisoned a nonperforming loan portfolio with a value of 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.68 billion -rrb- to lone star .
no details were given as to how much the texas equity company paid , but analysts estimate anywhere from between 40 to 70 percent of the portfolio value , which would be up to 2.5 billion euros .
in germany , the current npl market is worth an estimated 300 billion euros and more portfolios are expected to hit the market in the near future . the sales serve a few purposes .
rating agencies and investors have been pressuring banks to increase the quality of loan portfolios and want to shine more light on the rotting pile of bad credit .
in 2006 , the new accounting agreement basel ii also comes into force .
it requires banks to increase their reserves against problem loans , so german banks are washing their hands of the dirt of bad mortgage and real estate deals , many of which were reached in the heady days after the fall of communism and reunification . the effect of such transactions for banks is twofold according to hans-günther nordhues , a frankfurt lawyer who is active in processing npl deals . “ getting rid of bad debts would open up the possibility for them to enter into more profitable businesses in the future , ” said nordhues .
“ secondly , the german banks are then reduced in size since a number of services and functions would be taken over by the capital market . ” considering that the big german financial institutes such as deutsche bank and hvb group have declared downsizing to be primary goals in the upcoming years , this is one viable means to do so . the recollection of loans is not a strong point of german banks , according to hüther .
those institutes suffering the most under the burden of bad loans do not “ necessarily have the best know-how at their disposal when it comes to dealing with loans . ” an inside job is easier that is where lone star and karsten von köller enter .
just over a year ago , he still belonged to the clique of mortgage and real estate bankers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany 's karsten von köller is now all smiles as he turns to his peers to ease their banks of bad loans , and lone star is the beneficiary throughout the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , von köller was on the board of the german mortgage and real estate bank rheinhyp .
when that bank merged with two competitors in august 2002 to create eurohypo , he was named chairman of the board .
shortly thereafter , the 65-year old switched sides . in 2004 he assumed the position of director of lone star germany and now is going to financial institutions throughout the country , visiting his peers , and offering to buy back poor-performing loans - naturally at a discount .
if he convinces them to sell , lone star ’ s subsidiary , hudson advisors , goes to work getting the borrowers to repay . “ we try to offer -lsb- the borrowers -rsb- a solution for their npl problem and to reach an agreement , ” said von köller , “ but we also prepare the necessary legal proceedings that we may have to take if the borrowers do not cooperate . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany besides lone star , companies with names like cerberus and fortress are taking billions of us dollars from institutional investors such as state , corporate and university pension funds to purchase nonperforming real estate loan portfolios in germany .
von köller would not give any specific figures for lone star but did refer to analysts ’ expectations that profit margins of 20 percent and beyond were possible . german banks could only dream of such returns .
on the other hand , they are getting an injection of badly needed equity to maintain their dwindling status on the world financial stage and as hüther admitted , germany and german financial institutions are potential beneficiaries of knowledge transfer from the american equity funds on how to achieve good returns even on bad loans . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de duty to country or just to shareholders ?

“ they can quickly clean up their balance sheets and get a shot of extra liquidity , ” said michael hüther , director of the institute for the german economy in cologne .
the sums involved are by no means miniscule . billions of euros waiting to be harvested last september , the hypo real estate bank jettisoned a nonperforming loan portfolio with a value of 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.68 billion -rrb- to lone star .
no details were given as to how much the texas equity company paid , but analysts estimate anywhere from between 40 to 70 percent of the portfolio value , which would be up to 2.5 billion euros .
in germany , the current npl market is worth an estimated 300 billion euros and more portfolios are expected to hit the market in the near future . the sales serve a few purposes .
rating agencies and investors have been pressuring banks to increase the quality of loan portfolios and want to shine more light on the rotting pile of bad credit .
in 2006 , the new accounting agreement basel ii also comes into force .
it requires banks to increase their reserves against problem loans , so german banks are washing their hands of the dirt of bad mortgage and real estate deals , many of which were reached in the heady days after the fall of communism and reunification . the effect of such transactions for banks is twofold according to hans-günther nordhues , a frankfurt lawyer who is active in processing npl deals . “ getting rid of bad debts would open up the possibility for them to enter into more profitable businesses in the future , ” said nordhues .
“ secondly , the german banks are then reduced in size since a number of services and functions would be taken over by the capital market . ” considering that the big german financial institutes such as deutsche bank and hvb group have declared downsizing to be primary goals in the upcoming years , this is one viable means to do so . the recollection of loans is not a strong point of german banks , according to hüther .
those institutes suffering the most under the burden of bad loans do not “ necessarily have the best know-how at their disposal when it comes to dealing with loans . ” an inside job is easier that is where lone star and karsten von köller enter .
just over a year ago , he still belonged to the clique of mortgage and real estate bankers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany 's karsten von köller is now all smiles as he turns to his peers to ease their banks of bad loans , and lone star is the beneficiary throughout the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , von köller was on the board of the german mortgage and real estate bank rheinhyp .
when that bank merged with two competitors in august 2002 to create eurohypo , he was named chairman of the board .
shortly thereafter , the 65-year old switched sides . in 2004 he assumed the position of director of lone star germany and now is going to financial institutions throughout the country , visiting his peers , and offering to buy back poor-performing loans - naturally at a discount .
if he convinces them to sell , lone star ’ s subsidiary , hudson advisors , goes to work getting the borrowers to repay . “ we try to offer -lsb- the borrowers -rsb- a solution for their npl problem and to reach an agreement , ” said von köller , “ but we also prepare the necessary legal proceedings that we may have to take if the borrowers do not cooperate . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany besides lone star , companies with names like cerberus and fortress are taking billions of us dollars from institutional investors such as state , corporate and university pension funds to purchase nonperforming real estate loan portfolios in germany .
von köller would not give any specific figures for lone star but did refer to analysts ’ expectations that profit margins of 20 percent and beyond were possible . german banks could only dream of such returns .
on the other hand , they are getting an injection of badly needed equity to maintain their dwindling status on the world financial stage and as hüther admitted , germany and german financial institutions are potential beneficiaries of knowledge transfer from the american equity funds on how to achieve good returns even on bad loans . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de duty to country or just to shareholders ?
deutsche bank 's announcement of job cuts after it posted a 87 percent increase in net profit raised a furor in germany .

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .

a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .

for several years in the early 1990s , construction companies are said to have paid 90 million euros -lrb- $ 116 million -rrb- in bribes , swelling the coffers of political parties .
their reward : contracts to build and maintain secondary schools in the paris area . and yet again , the trials involve president chirac when he served as mayor of paris and his allies , politicians from the entire spectrum .
mr chirac invoked presidential immunity to escape investigation over other affairs , but his allies did n't have that option . " it was very organized , " said nicolas lecaussin of the ifrap in paris – a private think tank that aims to hold france ’ s public administration to account . prosecutions on the rise prosecutions for corruption have been on the rise in france since the 1980s , particularly involving the prominent . it ’ s thought to be one reason why french people hold their politicians in such low esteem . " what i think will come out of this , is the coming out into the open of a whole system of behaviour that should no longer have a place in a democracy , " said attorney jean-yves dupeux , who is helping the prosecution . lecaussin says that his organization is unique in europe and the us and that this explains much .
" nobody knows where the money goes , and even the politicians recognize this , " he said .
" you can ask a deputy at the national assembly and he will say that he votes for the budget but does n't know where the money goes .
it is incredible and it is why there is corruption in france . " hit film reflects era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl and former french president francois miterrand a recent box office hit called " le promeneur du champ de mars " tells the story of the late president mitterand ’ s last few months before his death in 1995 .
it ’ s also a reminder of an era which is largely blamed for creating a system in which corruption became almost institutionalized . in the fifteen years from the start of francois mitterand ’ s presidency , corruption convictions among elected officials increased six-fold . ifrap has lists of those who have been brought to justice : business executives , former government ministers , even the head of a gastronomy association who spent millions of euros of public money lunching his way round europe .
last year , one case in particular was very enlightening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bordeaux mayor and former french prime minister alain juppe alain juppe -lrb- photo -rrb- – former prime minister , close friend and ally of the president - was convicted of being part of an illegal party funding scam .
but far from shunning him , political colleagues applauded when he appeared back in parliament .
president chirac could hardly have been more glowing in his praise . " he ’ s a politician of exceptional quality – competent , humane and honest , " said chirac .
" and france needs men of his quality . " general suspicion the problem is that most french people seem to think the exact opposite – about mr juppe and politicians generally . lecaussin of ifrap believes corruption is a contributing factor . just last week , investigators abandoned their inquiry into mr chirac ’ s family holidays , allegedly paid for using bundles of cash of uncertain origin .

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.03.2005 texans take a shine to bad german loans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline is home to germany 's banks - and bad loans german banks are drowning in bad debts , particularly in the real estate branch .
yet one man ’ s trash is another man ’ s treasure .
american equity funds have been snapping up the portfolios being discarded in germany . karsten von köller does not give most people the impression of being a cowboy .
smartly dressed in a pin-striped suit , with an aristocratic air about him but still mild mannered , you would recognize him as a businessman , but you would not necessarily know that he is managing billions of dollars for lone star capital , a private equity company from dallas , texas . perhaps unlike one of the lone star state ’ s more high-profile cowboys of the moment , george w. bush , lone star capital likes to spend time in germany .
a lot .
or better said : lone star likes germany ’ s bad loans , in the industry referred to as npls - nonperforming loans , and there are a lot of those .
german banks are dumping the npls onto the market in record numbers .
not individually , but in packages or portfolios whose files are so valuable that they are transported with a police escort from one german city to the next after a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hypovereinsbank and its real estate subsidiary , hypo real estate , are purging themselves of their nonperforming loans the financial institutions are happy to purge them .
“ they can quickly clean up their balance sheets and get a shot of extra liquidity , ” said michael hüther , director of the institute for the german economy in cologne .
the sums involved are by no means miniscule . billions of euros waiting to be harvested last september , the hypo real estate bank jettisoned a nonperforming loan portfolio with a value of 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.68 billion -rrb- to lone star .
no details were given as to how much the texas equity company paid , but analysts estimate anywhere from between 40 to 70 percent of the portfolio value , which would be up to 2.5 billion euros .
in germany , the current npl market is worth an estimated 300 billion euros and more portfolios are expected to hit the market in the near future . the sales serve a few purposes .
rating agencies and investors have been pressuring banks to increase the quality of loan portfolios and want to shine more light on the rotting pile of bad credit .
in 2006 , the new accounting agreement basel ii also comes into force .
it requires banks to increase their reserves against problem loans , so german banks are washing their hands of the dirt of bad mortgage and real estate deals , many of which were reached in the heady days after the fall of communism and reunification . the effect of such transactions for banks is twofold according to hans-günther nordhues , a frankfurt lawyer who is active in processing npl deals . “ getting rid of bad debts would open up the possibility for them to enter into more profitable businesses in the future , ” said nordhues .
“ secondly , the german banks are then reduced in size since a number of services and functions would be taken over by the capital market . ” considering that the big german financial institutes such as deutsche bank and hvb group have declared downsizing to be primary goals in the upcoming years , this is one viable means to do so . the recollection of loans is not a strong point of german banks , according to hüther .
those institutes suffering the most under the burden of bad loans do not “ necessarily have the best know-how at their disposal when it comes to dealing with loans . ” an inside job is easier that is where lone star and karsten von köller enter .
just over a year ago , he still belonged to the clique of mortgage and real estate bankers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany 's karsten von köller is now all smiles as he turns to his peers to ease their banks of bad loans , and lone star is the beneficiary throughout the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , von köller was on the board of the german mortgage and real estate bank rheinhyp .
when that bank merged with two competitors in august 2002 to create eurohypo , he was named chairman of the board .
shortly thereafter , the 65-year old switched sides . in 2004 he assumed the position of director of lone star germany and now is going to financial institutions throughout the country , visiting his peers , and offering to buy back poor-performing loans - naturally at a discount .
if he convinces them to sell , lone star ’ s subsidiary , hudson advisors , goes to work getting the borrowers to repay . “ we try to offer -lsb- the borrowers -rsb- a solution for their npl problem and to reach an agreement , ” said von köller , “ but we also prepare the necessary legal proceedings that we may have to take if the borrowers do not cooperate . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany besides lone star , companies with names like cerberus and fortress are taking billions of us dollars from institutional investors such as state , corporate and university pension funds to purchase nonperforming real estate loan portfolios in germany .
von köller would not give any specific figures for lone star but did refer to analysts ’ expectations that profit margins of 20 percent and beyond were possible . german banks could only dream of such returns .
on the other hand , they are getting an injection of badly needed equity to maintain their dwindling status on the world financial stage and as hüther admitted , germany and german financial institutions are potential beneficiaries of knowledge transfer from the american equity funds on how to achieve good returns even on bad loans . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de duty to country or just to shareholders ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.03.2005 church breaks silence on " da vinci code " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal bertone : " do n't buy this book " rarely before have people read so much about jesus .
the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .
there could be no talk of a boycott appeal on the part of the vatican . oliver samson -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oh lord , what freaks !

yet one man ’ s trash is another man ’ s treasure .
american equity funds have been snapping up the portfolios being discarded in germany . karsten von köller does not give most people the impression of being a cowboy .
smartly dressed in a pin-striped suit , with an aristocratic air about him but still mild mannered , you would recognize him as a businessman , but you would not necessarily know that he is managing billions of dollars for lone star capital , a private equity company from dallas , texas . perhaps unlike one of the lone star state ’ s more high-profile cowboys of the moment , george w. bush , lone star capital likes to spend time in germany .
a lot .
or better said : lone star likes germany ’ s bad loans , in the industry referred to as npls - nonperforming loans , and there are a lot of those .
german banks are dumping the npls onto the market in record numbers .
not individually , but in packages or portfolios whose files are so valuable that they are transported with a police escort from one german city to the next after a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hypovereinsbank and its real estate subsidiary , hypo real estate , are purging themselves of their nonperforming loans the financial institutions are happy to purge them .
“ they can quickly clean up their balance sheets and get a shot of extra liquidity , ” said michael hüther , director of the institute for the german economy in cologne .
the sums involved are by no means miniscule . billions of euros waiting to be harvested last september , the hypo real estate bank jettisoned a nonperforming loan portfolio with a value of 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.68 billion -rrb- to lone star .
no details were given as to how much the texas equity company paid , but analysts estimate anywhere from between 40 to 70 percent of the portfolio value , which would be up to 2.5 billion euros .
in germany , the current npl market is worth an estimated 300 billion euros and more portfolios are expected to hit the market in the near future . the sales serve a few purposes .
rating agencies and investors have been pressuring banks to increase the quality of loan portfolios and want to shine more light on the rotting pile of bad credit .
in 2006 , the new accounting agreement basel ii also comes into force .
it requires banks to increase their reserves against problem loans , so german banks are washing their hands of the dirt of bad mortgage and real estate deals , many of which were reached in the heady days after the fall of communism and reunification . the effect of such transactions for banks is twofold according to hans-günther nordhues , a frankfurt lawyer who is active in processing npl deals . “ getting rid of bad debts would open up the possibility for them to enter into more profitable businesses in the future , ” said nordhues .
“ secondly , the german banks are then reduced in size since a number of services and functions would be taken over by the capital market . ” considering that the big german financial institutes such as deutsche bank and hvb group have declared downsizing to be primary goals in the upcoming years , this is one viable means to do so . the recollection of loans is not a strong point of german banks , according to hüther .
those institutes suffering the most under the burden of bad loans do not “ necessarily have the best know-how at their disposal when it comes to dealing with loans . ” an inside job is easier that is where lone star and karsten von köller enter .
just over a year ago , he still belonged to the clique of mortgage and real estate bankers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany 's karsten von köller is now all smiles as he turns to his peers to ease their banks of bad loans , and lone star is the beneficiary throughout the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , von köller was on the board of the german mortgage and real estate bank rheinhyp .
when that bank merged with two competitors in august 2002 to create eurohypo , he was named chairman of the board .
shortly thereafter , the 65-year old switched sides . in 2004 he assumed the position of director of lone star germany and now is going to financial institutions throughout the country , visiting his peers , and offering to buy back poor-performing loans - naturally at a discount .
if he convinces them to sell , lone star ’ s subsidiary , hudson advisors , goes to work getting the borrowers to repay . “ we try to offer -lsb- the borrowers -rsb- a solution for their npl problem and to reach an agreement , ” said von köller , “ but we also prepare the necessary legal proceedings that we may have to take if the borrowers do not cooperate . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany besides lone star , companies with names like cerberus and fortress are taking billions of us dollars from institutional investors such as state , corporate and university pension funds to purchase nonperforming real estate loan portfolios in germany .
von köller would not give any specific figures for lone star but did refer to analysts ’ expectations that profit margins of 20 percent and beyond were possible . german banks could only dream of such returns .
on the other hand , they are getting an injection of badly needed equity to maintain their dwindling status on the world financial stage and as hüther admitted , germany and german financial institutions are potential beneficiaries of knowledge transfer from the american equity funds on how to achieve good returns even on bad loans . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de duty to country or just to shareholders ?

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .
there could be no talk of a boycott appeal on the part of the vatican . oliver samson -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oh lord , what freaks !

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .

for a decade now , borderless travel through 12 eu states has been a reality , thanks to the schengen agreement . it finally happened on march 26 , 1995 .
" we 've now succeeded in completely doing away with borders , " proclaimed former dutch defense minister wim van eekelen .
ten years ago , in the tiny luxembourgian border town of schengen , the treaty signed by france , germany and the benelux countries came into effect , making borderless travel possible . since then , thousands of tourists have made a point of visiting the tiny village .
there , they find a memorial , and now , a small info-center .
mayor roger weber is pleased that schengen has achieved international recognition because of its association with travel freedom . " sure , we 're proud that the agreement was signed in schengen , " he beams .
" it was actually more of a coincidence , but we 're happy that it happened here .

for a decade now , borderless travel through 12 eu states has been a reality , thanks to the schengen agreement . it finally happened on march 26 , 1995 .
" we 've now succeeded in completely doing away with borders , " proclaimed former dutch defense minister wim van eekelen .
ten years ago , in the tiny luxembourgian border town of schengen , the treaty signed by france , germany and the benelux countries came into effect , making borderless travel possible . since then , thousands of tourists have made a point of visiting the tiny village .
there , they find a memorial , and now , a small info-center .
mayor roger weber is pleased that schengen has achieved international recognition because of its association with travel freedom . " sure , we 're proud that the agreement was signed in schengen , " he beams .
" it was actually more of a coincidence , but we 're happy that it happened here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to schengen back then , officials were on the lookout for a border crossing for the five founding states : germany , france , belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg .
since luxembourg was holding the rotating eu council presidency at the time , the choice fell on the tiny village on the mosel river .
the introduction of total freedom of travel was an experiment , beyond the actual agreements of the european union . at the core of the eu identity now , schengen belongs to the core of the european identity .
twelve of the 25 eu states have signed the agreement .
hardly any eu citizens have to show their papers at the eu 's borders these days .
only the british and irish have to prove their identities upon crossing over to continental europe as , due to their island status , they did n't join the schengen agreement . on the other hand , norway and iceland - both not members of the eu - have joined the schengen club .
switzerland too , recently decided to join .
the newest member states in eastern europe are also meant to soon add their signatures .
in return , the eu commission has promised its support in building up security on the eu 's new external borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's interior minister patrick dewael , left , talks with his german counterpart otto schilly , center , and luxembourg 's justice minister luc frieden , as they agreed on the " schengen iii declaration " , in brussels , friday may 28 , 2004 .
it provides the reinforcement of police cooperation between the countries .
partly because of this process , " schengen " has become synonymous with heightened external border controls and more cooperation between police forces .
that has its advantages , but also its problems .
above all , privacy protectors have criticized the " schengen informations-system 2 " being set up by the eu .
the system is meant to handle more data , to which all police and intelligence services in the eu will have access .
the computer network will be used to exchange information on suspects between all schengen states . as a parallel , the eu commission has proposed a visa computer system that would contain information on all people entering and leaving via the eu 's external borders .
however , member states have not yet been able to agree on such a system . " i love schengen ! " an eu diplomat in brussels admitted that schengen has undoubtedly given criminals lots more freedom of movement - something that has yet to be mirrored in the way that police forces cooperate across internal borders . despite such problems , most people in the eu would likely agree with the statement made by an enthusiastic young american tourist who entered into the schengen-area and is now travelling hassle-free from country to country : " i love schengen !

yet one man ’ s trash is another man ’ s treasure .
american equity funds have been snapping up the portfolios being discarded in germany . karsten von köller does not give most people the impression of being a cowboy .
smartly dressed in a pin-striped suit , with an aristocratic air about him but still mild mannered , you would recognize him as a businessman , but you would not necessarily know that he is managing billions of dollars for lone star capital , a private equity company from dallas , texas . perhaps unlike one of the lone star state ’ s more high-profile cowboys of the moment , george w. bush , lone star capital likes to spend time in germany .
a lot .
or better said : lone star likes germany ’ s bad loans , in the industry referred to as npls - nonperforming loans , and there are a lot of those .
german banks are dumping the npls onto the market in record numbers .
not individually , but in packages or portfolios whose files are so valuable that they are transported with a police escort from one german city to the next after a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hypovereinsbank and its real estate subsidiary , hypo real estate , are purging themselves of their nonperforming loans the financial institutions are happy to purge them .
“ they can quickly clean up their balance sheets and get a shot of extra liquidity , ” said michael hüther , director of the institute for the german economy in cologne .
the sums involved are by no means miniscule . billions of euros waiting to be harvested last september , the hypo real estate bank jettisoned a nonperforming loan portfolio with a value of 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.68 billion -rrb- to lone star .
no details were given as to how much the texas equity company paid , but analysts estimate anywhere from between 40 to 70 percent of the portfolio value , which would be up to 2.5 billion euros .
in germany , the current npl market is worth an estimated 300 billion euros and more portfolios are expected to hit the market in the near future . the sales serve a few purposes .
rating agencies and investors have been pressuring banks to increase the quality of loan portfolios and want to shine more light on the rotting pile of bad credit .
in 2006 , the new accounting agreement basel ii also comes into force .
it requires banks to increase their reserves against problem loans , so german banks are washing their hands of the dirt of bad mortgage and real estate deals , many of which were reached in the heady days after the fall of communism and reunification . the effect of such transactions for banks is twofold according to hans-günther nordhues , a frankfurt lawyer who is active in processing npl deals . “ getting rid of bad debts would open up the possibility for them to enter into more profitable businesses in the future , ” said nordhues .
“ secondly , the german banks are then reduced in size since a number of services and functions would be taken over by the capital market . ” considering that the big german financial institutes such as deutsche bank and hvb group have declared downsizing to be primary goals in the upcoming years , this is one viable means to do so . the recollection of loans is not a strong point of german banks , according to hüther .
those institutes suffering the most under the burden of bad loans do not “ necessarily have the best know-how at their disposal when it comes to dealing with loans . ” an inside job is easier that is where lone star and karsten von köller enter .
just over a year ago , he still belonged to the clique of mortgage and real estate bankers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany 's karsten von köller is now all smiles as he turns to his peers to ease their banks of bad loans , and lone star is the beneficiary throughout the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , von köller was on the board of the german mortgage and real estate bank rheinhyp .
when that bank merged with two competitors in august 2002 to create eurohypo , he was named chairman of the board .
shortly thereafter , the 65-year old switched sides . in 2004 he assumed the position of director of lone star germany and now is going to financial institutions throughout the country , visiting his peers , and offering to buy back poor-performing loans - naturally at a discount .
if he convinces them to sell , lone star ’ s subsidiary , hudson advisors , goes to work getting the borrowers to repay . “ we try to offer -lsb- the borrowers -rsb- a solution for their npl problem and to reach an agreement , ” said von köller , “ but we also prepare the necessary legal proceedings that we may have to take if the borrowers do not cooperate . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany besides lone star , companies with names like cerberus and fortress are taking billions of us dollars from institutional investors such as state , corporate and university pension funds to purchase nonperforming real estate loan portfolios in germany .
von köller would not give any specific figures for lone star but did refer to analysts ’ expectations that profit margins of 20 percent and beyond were possible . german banks could only dream of such returns .
on the other hand , they are getting an injection of badly needed equity to maintain their dwindling status on the world financial stage and as hüther admitted , germany and german financial institutions are potential beneficiaries of knowledge transfer from the american equity funds on how to achieve good returns even on bad loans . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de duty to country or just to shareholders ?

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .
there could be no talk of a boycott appeal on the part of the vatican . oliver samson -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oh lord , what freaks !

for several years in the early 1990s , construction companies are said to have paid 90 million euros -lrb- $ 116 million -rrb- in bribes , swelling the coffers of political parties .
their reward : contracts to build and maintain secondary schools in the paris area . and yet again , the trials involve president chirac when he served as mayor of paris and his allies , politicians from the entire spectrum .
mr chirac invoked presidential immunity to escape investigation over other affairs , but his allies did n't have that option . " it was very organized , " said nicolas lecaussin of the ifrap in paris – a private think tank that aims to hold france ’ s public administration to account . prosecutions on the rise prosecutions for corruption have been on the rise in france since the 1980s , particularly involving the prominent . it ’ s thought to be one reason why french people hold their politicians in such low esteem . " what i think will come out of this , is the coming out into the open of a whole system of behaviour that should no longer have a place in a democracy , " said attorney jean-yves dupeux , who is helping the prosecution . lecaussin says that his organization is unique in europe and the us and that this explains much .
" nobody knows where the money goes , and even the politicians recognize this , " he said .
" you can ask a deputy at the national assembly and he will say that he votes for the budget but does n't know where the money goes .
it is incredible and it is why there is corruption in france . " hit film reflects era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl and former french president francois miterrand a recent box office hit called " le promeneur du champ de mars " tells the story of the late president mitterand ’ s last few months before his death in 1995 .
it ’ s also a reminder of an era which is largely blamed for creating a system in which corruption became almost institutionalized . in the fifteen years from the start of francois mitterand ’ s presidency , corruption convictions among elected officials increased six-fold . ifrap has lists of those who have been brought to justice : business executives , former government ministers , even the head of a gastronomy association who spent millions of euros of public money lunching his way round europe .
last year , one case in particular was very enlightening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bordeaux mayor and former french prime minister alain juppe alain juppe -lrb- photo -rrb- – former prime minister , close friend and ally of the president - was convicted of being part of an illegal party funding scam .
but far from shunning him , political colleagues applauded when he appeared back in parliament .
president chirac could hardly have been more glowing in his praise . " he ’ s a politician of exceptional quality – competent , humane and honest , " said chirac .
" and france needs men of his quality . " general suspicion the problem is that most french people seem to think the exact opposite – about mr juppe and politicians generally . lecaussin of ifrap believes corruption is a contributing factor . just last week , investigators abandoned their inquiry into mr chirac ’ s family holidays , allegedly paid for using bundles of cash of uncertain origin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.03.2005 church breaks silence on " da vinci code " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal bertone : " do n't buy this book " rarely before have people read so much about jesus .
the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .
there could be no talk of a boycott appeal on the part of the vatican . oliver samson -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oh lord , what freaks !

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .

“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.03.2005 texans take a shine to bad german loans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline is home to germany 's banks - and bad loans german banks are drowning in bad debts , particularly in the real estate branch .
yet one man ’ s trash is another man ’ s treasure .
american equity funds have been snapping up the portfolios being discarded in germany . karsten von köller does not give most people the impression of being a cowboy .
smartly dressed in a pin-striped suit , with an aristocratic air about him but still mild mannered , you would recognize him as a businessman , but you would not necessarily know that he is managing billions of dollars for lone star capital , a private equity company from dallas , texas . perhaps unlike one of the lone star state ’ s more high-profile cowboys of the moment , george w. bush , lone star capital likes to spend time in germany .
a lot .
or better said : lone star likes germany ’ s bad loans , in the industry referred to as npls - nonperforming loans , and there are a lot of those .
german banks are dumping the npls onto the market in record numbers .
not individually , but in packages or portfolios whose files are so valuable that they are transported with a police escort from one german city to the next after a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hypovereinsbank and its real estate subsidiary , hypo real estate , are purging themselves of their nonperforming loans the financial institutions are happy to purge them .
“ they can quickly clean up their balance sheets and get a shot of extra liquidity , ” said michael hüther , director of the institute for the german economy in cologne .
the sums involved are by no means miniscule . billions of euros waiting to be harvested last september , the hypo real estate bank jettisoned a nonperforming loan portfolio with a value of 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.68 billion -rrb- to lone star .
no details were given as to how much the texas equity company paid , but analysts estimate anywhere from between 40 to 70 percent of the portfolio value , which would be up to 2.5 billion euros .
in germany , the current npl market is worth an estimated 300 billion euros and more portfolios are expected to hit the market in the near future . the sales serve a few purposes .
rating agencies and investors have been pressuring banks to increase the quality of loan portfolios and want to shine more light on the rotting pile of bad credit .
in 2006 , the new accounting agreement basel ii also comes into force .
it requires banks to increase their reserves against problem loans , so german banks are washing their hands of the dirt of bad mortgage and real estate deals , many of which were reached in the heady days after the fall of communism and reunification . the effect of such transactions for banks is twofold according to hans-günther nordhues , a frankfurt lawyer who is active in processing npl deals . “ getting rid of bad debts would open up the possibility for them to enter into more profitable businesses in the future , ” said nordhues .
“ secondly , the german banks are then reduced in size since a number of services and functions would be taken over by the capital market . ” considering that the big german financial institutes such as deutsche bank and hvb group have declared downsizing to be primary goals in the upcoming years , this is one viable means to do so . the recollection of loans is not a strong point of german banks , according to hüther .
those institutes suffering the most under the burden of bad loans do not “ necessarily have the best know-how at their disposal when it comes to dealing with loans . ” an inside job is easier that is where lone star and karsten von köller enter .
just over a year ago , he still belonged to the clique of mortgage and real estate bankers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany 's karsten von köller is now all smiles as he turns to his peers to ease their banks of bad loans , and lone star is the beneficiary throughout the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , von köller was on the board of the german mortgage and real estate bank rheinhyp .
when that bank merged with two competitors in august 2002 to create eurohypo , he was named chairman of the board .
shortly thereafter , the 65-year old switched sides . in 2004 he assumed the position of director of lone star germany and now is going to financial institutions throughout the country , visiting his peers , and offering to buy back poor-performing loans - naturally at a discount .
if he convinces them to sell , lone star ’ s subsidiary , hudson advisors , goes to work getting the borrowers to repay . “ we try to offer -lsb- the borrowers -rsb- a solution for their npl problem and to reach an agreement , ” said von köller , “ but we also prepare the necessary legal proceedings that we may have to take if the borrowers do not cooperate . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany besides lone star , companies with names like cerberus and fortress are taking billions of us dollars from institutional investors such as state , corporate and university pension funds to purchase nonperforming real estate loan portfolios in germany .

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .
there could be no talk of a boycott appeal on the part of the vatican . oliver samson -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oh lord , what freaks !

american equity funds have been snapping up the portfolios being discarded in germany . karsten von köller does not give most people the impression of being a cowboy .
smartly dressed in a pin-striped suit , with an aristocratic air about him but still mild mannered , you would recognize him as a businessman , but you would not necessarily know that he is managing billions of dollars for lone star capital , a private equity company from dallas , texas . perhaps unlike one of the lone star state ’ s more high-profile cowboys of the moment , george w. bush , lone star capital likes to spend time in germany .
a lot .
or better said : lone star likes germany ’ s bad loans , in the industry referred to as npls - nonperforming loans , and there are a lot of those .
german banks are dumping the npls onto the market in record numbers .
not individually , but in packages or portfolios whose files are so valuable that they are transported with a police escort from one german city to the next after a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hypovereinsbank and its real estate subsidiary , hypo real estate , are purging themselves of their nonperforming loans the financial institutions are happy to purge them .

no details were given as to how much the texas equity company paid , but analysts estimate anywhere from between 40 to 70 percent of the portfolio value , which would be up to 2.5 billion euros .
in germany , the current npl market is worth an estimated 300 billion euros and more portfolios are expected to hit the market in the near future . the sales serve a few purposes .
rating agencies and investors have been pressuring banks to increase the quality of loan portfolios and want to shine more light on the rotting pile of bad credit .
in 2006 , the new accounting agreement basel ii also comes into force .
it requires banks to increase their reserves against problem loans , so german banks are washing their hands of the dirt of bad mortgage and real estate deals , many of which were reached in the heady days after the fall of communism and reunification . the effect of such transactions for banks is twofold according to hans-günther nordhues , a frankfurt lawyer who is active in processing npl deals . “ getting rid of bad debts would open up the possibility for them to enter into more profitable businesses in the future , ” said nordhues .
“ secondly , the german banks are then reduced in size since a number of services and functions would be taken over by the capital market . ” considering that the big german financial institutes such as deutsche bank and hvb group have declared downsizing to be primary goals in the upcoming years , this is one viable means to do so . the recollection of loans is not a strong point of german banks , according to hüther .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.03.2005 church breaks silence on " da vinci code " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal bertone : " do n't buy this book " rarely before have people read so much about jesus .
the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .
there could be no talk of a boycott appeal on the part of the vatican . oliver samson -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oh lord , what freaks !

according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .

american equity funds have been snapping up the portfolios being discarded in germany . karsten von köller does not give most people the impression of being a cowboy .
smartly dressed in a pin-striped suit , with an aristocratic air about him but still mild mannered , you would recognize him as a businessman , but you would not necessarily know that he is managing billions of dollars for lone star capital , a private equity company from dallas , texas . perhaps unlike one of the lone star state ’ s more high-profile cowboys of the moment , george w. bush , lone star capital likes to spend time in germany .
a lot .
or better said : lone star likes germany ’ s bad loans , in the industry referred to as npls - nonperforming loans , and there are a lot of those .
german banks are dumping the npls onto the market in record numbers .
not individually , but in packages or portfolios whose files are so valuable that they are transported with a police escort from one german city to the next after a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hypovereinsbank and its real estate subsidiary , hypo real estate , are purging themselves of their nonperforming loans the financial institutions are happy to purge them .
“ they can quickly clean up their balance sheets and get a shot of extra liquidity , ” said michael hüther , director of the institute for the german economy in cologne .

no details were given as to how much the texas equity company paid , but analysts estimate anywhere from between 40 to 70 percent of the portfolio value , which would be up to 2.5 billion euros .
in germany , the current npl market is worth an estimated 300 billion euros and more portfolios are expected to hit the market in the near future . the sales serve a few purposes .
rating agencies and investors have been pressuring banks to increase the quality of loan portfolios and want to shine more light on the rotting pile of bad credit .
in 2006 , the new accounting agreement basel ii also comes into force .
it requires banks to increase their reserves against problem loans , so german banks are washing their hands of the dirt of bad mortgage and real estate deals , many of which were reached in the heady days after the fall of communism and reunification . the effect of such transactions for banks is twofold according to hans-günther nordhues , a frankfurt lawyer who is active in processing npl deals . “ getting rid of bad debts would open up the possibility for them to enter into more profitable businesses in the future , ” said nordhues .

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .

for several years in the early 1990s , construction companies are said to have paid 90 million euros -lrb- $ 116 million -rrb- in bribes , swelling the coffers of political parties .
their reward : contracts to build and maintain secondary schools in the paris area . and yet again , the trials involve president chirac when he served as mayor of paris and his allies , politicians from the entire spectrum .
mr chirac invoked presidential immunity to escape investigation over other affairs , but his allies did n't have that option . " it was very organized , " said nicolas lecaussin of the ifrap in paris – a private think tank that aims to hold france ’ s public administration to account . prosecutions on the rise prosecutions for corruption have been on the rise in france since the 1980s , particularly involving the prominent . it ’ s thought to be one reason why french people hold their politicians in such low esteem . " what i think will come out of this , is the coming out into the open of a whole system of behaviour that should no longer have a place in a democracy , " said attorney jean-yves dupeux , who is helping the prosecution . lecaussin says that his organization is unique in europe and the us and that this explains much .
" nobody knows where the money goes , and even the politicians recognize this , " he said .
" you can ask a deputy at the national assembly and he will say that he votes for the budget but does n't know where the money goes .
it is incredible and it is why there is corruption in france . " hit film reflects era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl and former french president francois miterrand a recent box office hit called " le promeneur du champ de mars " tells the story of the late president mitterand ’ s last few months before his death in 1995 .
it ’ s also a reminder of an era which is largely blamed for creating a system in which corruption became almost institutionalized . in the fifteen years from the start of francois mitterand ’ s presidency , corruption convictions among elected officials increased six-fold . ifrap has lists of those who have been brought to justice : business executives , former government ministers , even the head of a gastronomy association who spent millions of euros of public money lunching his way round europe .
last year , one case in particular was very enlightening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bordeaux mayor and former french prime minister alain juppe alain juppe -lrb- photo -rrb- – former prime minister , close friend and ally of the president - was convicted of being part of an illegal party funding scam .
but far from shunning him , political colleagues applauded when he appeared back in parliament .
president chirac could hardly have been more glowing in his praise . " he ’ s a politician of exceptional quality – competent , humane and honest , " said chirac .
" and france needs men of his quality . " general suspicion the problem is that most french people seem to think the exact opposite – about mr juppe and politicians generally . lecaussin of ifrap believes corruption is a contributing factor . just last week , investigators abandoned their inquiry into mr chirac ’ s family holidays , allegedly paid for using bundles of cash of uncertain origin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : europe without borders - 15 years of the schengen zone eu opens internal borders to long-stay visa holders , sparking security fears checkpoint-free europe confounds germany 's skeptics 15 years of visa-free travel in europe europe 's unity with swiss in libya visa row tested by business links europe -pipe- 26.03.2005 how europe 's borders were opened großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border checks inside the eu are the exception , not the rule passport , border and customs checks are foreign concepts for most young people in western europe .
for a decade now , borderless travel through 12 eu states has been a reality , thanks to the schengen agreement . it finally happened on march 26 , 1995 .
" we 've now succeeded in completely doing away with borders , " proclaimed former dutch defense minister wim van eekelen .
ten years ago , in the tiny luxembourgian border town of schengen , the treaty signed by france , germany and the benelux countries came into effect , making borderless travel possible . since then , thousands of tourists have made a point of visiting the tiny village .
there , they find a memorial , and now , a small info-center .
mayor roger weber is pleased that schengen has achieved international recognition because of its association with travel freedom . " sure , we 're proud that the agreement was signed in schengen , " he beams .
" it was actually more of a coincidence , but we 're happy that it happened here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to schengen back then , officials were on the lookout for a border crossing for the five founding states : germany , france , belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg .
since luxembourg was holding the rotating eu council presidency at the time , the choice fell on the tiny village on the mosel river .
the introduction of total freedom of travel was an experiment , beyond the actual agreements of the european union . at the core of the eu identity now , schengen belongs to the core of the european identity .
twelve of the 25 eu states have signed the agreement .
hardly any eu citizens have to show their papers at the eu 's borders these days .
only the british and irish have to prove their identities upon crossing over to continental europe as , due to their island status , they did n't join the schengen agreement . on the other hand , norway and iceland - both not members of the eu - have joined the schengen club .
switzerland too , recently decided to join .
the newest member states in eastern europe are also meant to soon add their signatures .
in return , the eu commission has promised its support in building up security on the eu 's new external borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's interior minister patrick dewael , left , talks with his german counterpart otto schilly , center , and luxembourg 's justice minister luc frieden , as they agreed on the " schengen iii declaration " , in brussels , friday may 28 , 2004 .
it provides the reinforcement of police cooperation between the countries .
partly because of this process , " schengen " has become synonymous with heightened external border controls and more cooperation between police forces .
that has its advantages , but also its problems .
above all , privacy protectors have criticized the " schengen informations-system 2 " being set up by the eu .
the system is meant to handle more data , to which all police and intelligence services in the eu will have access .
the computer network will be used to exchange information on suspects between all schengen states . as a parallel , the eu commission has proposed a visa computer system that would contain information on all people entering and leaving via the eu 's external borders .
however , member states have not yet been able to agree on such a system . " i love schengen ! " an eu diplomat in brussels admitted that schengen has undoubtedly given criminals lots more freedom of movement - something that has yet to be mirrored in the way that police forces cooperate across internal borders . despite such problems , most people in the eu would likely agree with the statement made by an enthusiastic young american tourist who entered into the schengen-area and is now travelling hassle-free from country to country : " i love schengen !

it is incredible and it is why there is corruption in france . " hit film reflects era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl and former french president francois miterrand a recent box office hit called " le promeneur du champ de mars " tells the story of the late president mitterand ’ s last few months before his death in 1995 .
it ’ s also a reminder of an era which is largely blamed for creating a system in which corruption became almost institutionalized . in the fifteen years from the start of francois mitterand ’ s presidency , corruption convictions among elected officials increased six-fold . ifrap has lists of those who have been brought to justice : business executives , former government ministers , even the head of a gastronomy association who spent millions of euros of public money lunching his way round europe .
last year , one case in particular was very enlightening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bordeaux mayor and former french prime minister alain juppe alain juppe -lrb- photo -rrb- – former prime minister , close friend and ally of the president - was convicted of being part of an illegal party funding scam .
but far from shunning him , political colleagues applauded when he appeared back in parliament .
president chirac could hardly have been more glowing in his praise . " he ’ s a politician of exceptional quality – competent , humane and honest , " said chirac .
" and france needs men of his quality . " general suspicion the problem is that most french people seem to think the exact opposite – about mr juppe and politicians generally . lecaussin of ifrap believes corruption is a contributing factor . just last week , investigators abandoned their inquiry into mr chirac ’ s family holidays , allegedly paid for using bundles of cash of uncertain origin .

or better said : lone star likes germany ’ s bad loans , in the industry referred to as npls - nonperforming loans , and there are a lot of those .
german banks are dumping the npls onto the market in record numbers .
not individually , but in packages or portfolios whose files are so valuable that they are transported with a police escort from one german city to the next after a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hypovereinsbank and its real estate subsidiary , hypo real estate , are purging themselves of their nonperforming loans the financial institutions are happy to purge them .
“ they can quickly clean up their balance sheets and get a shot of extra liquidity , ” said michael hüther , director of the institute for the german economy in cologne .
the sums involved are by no means miniscule . billions of euros waiting to be harvested last september , the hypo real estate bank jettisoned a nonperforming loan portfolio with a value of 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.68 billion -rrb- to lone star .
no details were given as to how much the texas equity company paid , but analysts estimate anywhere from between 40 to 70 percent of the portfolio value , which would be up to 2.5 billion euros .
in germany , the current npl market is worth an estimated 300 billion euros and more portfolios are expected to hit the market in the near future . the sales serve a few purposes .
rating agencies and investors have been pressuring banks to increase the quality of loan portfolios and want to shine more light on the rotting pile of bad credit .
in 2006 , the new accounting agreement basel ii also comes into force .
it requires banks to increase their reserves against problem loans , so german banks are washing their hands of the dirt of bad mortgage and real estate deals , many of which were reached in the heady days after the fall of communism and reunification . the effect of such transactions for banks is twofold according to hans-günther nordhues , a frankfurt lawyer who is active in processing npl deals . “ getting rid of bad debts would open up the possibility for them to enter into more profitable businesses in the future , ” said nordhues .
“ secondly , the german banks are then reduced in size since a number of services and functions would be taken over by the capital market . ” considering that the big german financial institutes such as deutsche bank and hvb group have declared downsizing to be primary goals in the upcoming years , this is one viable means to do so . the recollection of loans is not a strong point of german banks , according to hüther .
those institutes suffering the most under the burden of bad loans do not “ necessarily have the best know-how at their disposal when it comes to dealing with loans . ” an inside job is easier that is where lone star and karsten von köller enter .
just over a year ago , he still belonged to the clique of mortgage and real estate bankers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany 's karsten von köller is now all smiles as he turns to his peers to ease their banks of bad loans , and lone star is the beneficiary throughout the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , von köller was on the board of the german mortgage and real estate bank rheinhyp .
when that bank merged with two competitors in august 2002 to create eurohypo , he was named chairman of the board .
shortly thereafter , the 65-year old switched sides . in 2004 he assumed the position of director of lone star germany and now is going to financial institutions throughout the country , visiting his peers , and offering to buy back poor-performing loans - naturally at a discount .
if he convinces them to sell , lone star ’ s subsidiary , hudson advisors , goes to work getting the borrowers to repay . “ we try to offer -lsb- the borrowers -rsb- a solution for their npl problem and to reach an agreement , ” said von köller , “ but we also prepare the necessary legal proceedings that we may have to take if the borrowers do not cooperate . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lone star germany besides lone star , companies with names like cerberus and fortress are taking billions of us dollars from institutional investors such as state , corporate and university pension funds to purchase nonperforming real estate loan portfolios in germany .
von köller would not give any specific figures for lone star but did refer to analysts ’ expectations that profit margins of 20 percent and beyond were possible . german banks could only dream of such returns .
on the other hand , they are getting an injection of badly needed equity to maintain their dwindling status on the world financial stage and as hüther admitted , germany and german financial institutions are potential beneficiaries of knowledge transfer from the american equity funds on how to achieve good returns even on bad loans . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de duty to country or just to shareholders ?

their reward : contracts to build and maintain secondary schools in the paris area . and yet again , the trials involve president chirac when he served as mayor of paris and his allies , politicians from the entire spectrum .
mr chirac invoked presidential immunity to escape investigation over other affairs , but his allies did n't have that option .

for several years in the early 1990s , construction companies are said to have paid 90 million euros -lrb- $ 116 million -rrb- in bribes , swelling the coffers of political parties .
their reward : contracts to build and maintain secondary schools in the paris area . and yet again , the trials involve president chirac when he served as mayor of paris and his allies , politicians from the entire spectrum .
mr chirac invoked presidential immunity to escape investigation over other affairs , but his allies did n't have that option . " it was very organized , " said nicolas lecaussin of the ifrap in paris – a private think tank that aims to hold france ’ s public administration to account . prosecutions on the rise prosecutions for corruption have been on the rise in france since the 1980s , particularly involving the prominent . it ’ s thought to be one reason why french people hold their politicians in such low esteem . " what i think will come out of this , is the coming out into the open of a whole system of behaviour that should no longer have a place in a democracy , " said attorney jean-yves dupeux , who is helping the prosecution . lecaussin says that his organization is unique in europe and the us and that this explains much .
" nobody knows where the money goes , and even the politicians recognize this , " he said .
" you can ask a deputy at the national assembly and he will say that he votes for the budget but does n't know where the money goes .
it is incredible and it is why there is corruption in france . " hit film reflects era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl and former french president francois miterrand a recent box office hit called " le promeneur du champ de mars " tells the story of the late president mitterand ’ s last few months before his death in 1995 .
it ’ s also a reminder of an era which is largely blamed for creating a system in which corruption became almost institutionalized . in the fifteen years from the start of francois mitterand ’ s presidency , corruption convictions among elected officials increased six-fold . ifrap has lists of those who have been brought to justice : business executives , former government ministers , even the head of a gastronomy association who spent millions of euros of public money lunching his way round europe .
last year , one case in particular was very enlightening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bordeaux mayor and former french prime minister alain juppe alain juppe -lrb- photo -rrb- – former prime minister , close friend and ally of the president - was convicted of being part of an illegal party funding scam .
but far from shunning him , political colleagues applauded when he appeared back in parliament .
president chirac could hardly have been more glowing in his praise . " he ’ s a politician of exceptional quality – competent , humane and honest , " said chirac .
" and france needs men of his quality . " general suspicion the problem is that most french people seem to think the exact opposite – about mr juppe and politicians generally . lecaussin of ifrap believes corruption is a contributing factor . just last week , investigators abandoned their inquiry into mr chirac ’ s family holidays , allegedly paid for using bundles of cash of uncertain origin .
to outsiders , it suggests france has some way to go in taking its scandals seriously . alasdair sandford -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transparency needed to crush corruption in its 2005 global corruption report , transparency international reveals how corruption in the construction sector undermines economic development , and of the potential for crooked dealings in the reconstruction of iraq . -lrb- march 16 , 2005 the german problem with corruption a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .

for a decade now , borderless travel through 12 eu states has been a reality , thanks to the schengen agreement . it finally happened on march 26 , 1995 .
" we 've now succeeded in completely doing away with borders , " proclaimed former dutch defense minister wim van eekelen .
ten years ago , in the tiny luxembourgian border town of schengen , the treaty signed by france , germany and the benelux countries came into effect , making borderless travel possible . since then , thousands of tourists have made a point of visiting the tiny village .

for a decade now , borderless travel through 12 eu states has been a reality , thanks to the schengen agreement . it finally happened on march 26 , 1995 .
" we 've now succeeded in completely doing away with borders , " proclaimed former dutch defense minister wim van eekelen .
ten years ago , in the tiny luxembourgian border town of schengen , the treaty signed by france , germany and the benelux countries came into effect , making borderless travel possible . since then , thousands of tourists have made a point of visiting the tiny village .
there , they find a memorial , and now , a small info-center .
mayor roger weber is pleased that schengen has achieved international recognition because of its association with travel freedom . " sure , we 're proud that the agreement was signed in schengen , " he beams .
" it was actually more of a coincidence , but we 're happy that it happened here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to schengen back then , officials were on the lookout for a border crossing for the five founding states : germany , france , belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg .
since luxembourg was holding the rotating eu council presidency at the time , the choice fell on the tiny village on the mosel river .
the introduction of total freedom of travel was an experiment , beyond the actual agreements of the european union . at the core of the eu identity now , schengen belongs to the core of the european identity .
twelve of the 25 eu states have signed the agreement .
hardly any eu citizens have to show their papers at the eu 's borders these days .
only the british and irish have to prove their identities upon crossing over to continental europe as , due to their island status , they did n't join the schengen agreement . on the other hand , norway and iceland - both not members of the eu - have joined the schengen club .
switzerland too , recently decided to join .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.03.2005 french corruption erodes trust in politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his friends are in trouble the latest corruption trial of the french president 's cronies leaves the public shaking their heads , yet again . it is a case of déjà vu for millions of french people : forty-seven politicians and other officials are on trial this week over a vast kickback scheme .
for several years in the early 1990s , construction companies are said to have paid 90 million euros -lrb- $ 116 million -rrb- in bribes , swelling the coffers of political parties .
their reward : contracts to build and maintain secondary schools in the paris area . and yet again , the trials involve president chirac when he served as mayor of paris and his allies , politicians from the entire spectrum .
mr chirac invoked presidential immunity to escape investigation over other affairs , but his allies did n't have that option . " it was very organized , " said nicolas lecaussin of the ifrap in paris – a private think tank that aims to hold france ’ s public administration to account . prosecutions on the rise prosecutions for corruption have been on the rise in france since the 1980s , particularly involving the prominent . it ’ s thought to be one reason why french people hold their politicians in such low esteem . " what i think will come out of this , is the coming out into the open of a whole system of behaviour that should no longer have a place in a democracy , " said attorney jean-yves dupeux , who is helping the prosecution . lecaussin says that his organization is unique in europe and the us and that this explains much .
" nobody knows where the money goes , and even the politicians recognize this , " he said .
" you can ask a deputy at the national assembly and he will say that he votes for the budget but does n't know where the money goes .
it is incredible and it is why there is corruption in france . " hit film reflects era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl and former french president francois miterrand a recent box office hit called " le promeneur du champ de mars " tells the story of the late president mitterand ’ s last few months before his death in 1995 .
it ’ s also a reminder of an era which is largely blamed for creating a system in which corruption became almost institutionalized . in the fifteen years from the start of francois mitterand ’ s presidency , corruption convictions among elected officials increased six-fold . ifrap has lists of those who have been brought to justice : business executives , former government ministers , even the head of a gastronomy association who spent millions of euros of public money lunching his way round europe .
last year , one case in particular was very enlightening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bordeaux mayor and former french prime minister alain juppe alain juppe -lrb- photo -rrb- – former prime minister , close friend and ally of the president - was convicted of being part of an illegal party funding scam .
but far from shunning him , political colleagues applauded when he appeared back in parliament .
president chirac could hardly have been more glowing in his praise . " he ’ s a politician of exceptional quality – competent , humane and honest , " said chirac .
" and france needs men of his quality . " general suspicion the problem is that most french people seem to think the exact opposite – about mr juppe and politicians generally . lecaussin of ifrap believes corruption is a contributing factor . just last week , investigators abandoned their inquiry into mr chirac ’ s family holidays , allegedly paid for using bundles of cash of uncertain origin .

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .

the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it . apparently , there are people who find the bible boring , just as there are those who yawn when it comes to art history or religion .
but combine these with sex , conspiracy theories and a thriller plot , and you get precisely the right combination to mesmerize even the most lazy reader . over 25 million copies of dan brown ’ s “ the da vinci code ” have been sold .
and an end to the boom is not in sight .
a film version with tom hanks , audrey tatou and jean reno in the leading roles is hitting movie theaters in 2006 . the novel is about the holy grail and less holier secret societies .
according to brown , the last supper was actually the wedding feast of jesus and mary magdalene . the couple 's descendants , brown alleges , are part of a sacred bloodline that can be traced to france , and continue to walk among us today . according to the book 's plot , the catholic church and orders such as the knights templar and opus dei suppressed this knowledge - and for anyone who tries to uncover the truth , things can quickly get dangerous , as the two main protagonists discover . shameful lies the problem arises , though , that dan brown himself claimed that “ the art , the architecture , the secret rituals and loges ” were all “ historical facts . ”
many fans take at face value what historians and theologians are calling “ well-known humbug . ” the catholic church ignored the book after it was published in 2003 .
but in mid-march , the archbishop of genoa , cardinal tarcisio bertone finally broke the silence after repeated requests from his flock . “ don ’ t read and buy this book , ” tarcisio , for many years the number two man in the powerful vatican congregation , told vatican radio .
the work was “ shameful ” and told “ unfounded lies , ” he said . this past week , the cardinal called a seminar in genoa to separate the facts from the fiction .
the rented conference room was bursting at the seams .
the risk was very great “ that many people believe that these fairy-tales are true , ” he said . getting non-readers into books “ this book is everywhere , ” the cardinal fumed .
and brown ’ s german publisher concedes this is true . “ at the moment , there is really an extreme hype around brown , ” said marco schneider , editor of the german edition from publisher lübbe-verlag .
“ the da vinci code ” has developed into one of the most successful books of all time .
in germany , it tops several bestseller lists , together with brown ’ s next novel “ digital fortress . ” “ we are getting at an entirely new circle of readers , ” said schneider .
“ it includes a lot of people who otherwise have no other books at home . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says writing a good thriller is like making maple sugar candy and brown is certainly reaching people who otherwise have little to do with jesus , the church or art history . in the book ’ s settings , especially rome , paris and scotland , an entirely new type of tourist has developed .
they are not walking around with a travel guide in their hands , but rather the thriller and believe to be on the trail of christianity ’ s secrets .
in these locations , tourism operators offer “ da vinci code tours ” - with increasing success . “ for god ’ s sake ” so is the book being read by theologians , too ?
“ for god ’ s sake , ” said professor rainer kampling from the seminar for catholic theology at berlin ’ s free university .
he said he liked to read mystery novels occasionally , but life was just too short for “ bad food and bad books . ” according to kampling , the book ’ s hype had nothing to do with theology or even a serious occupation with belief .
for him , it is mainly a cultural phenomenon . “ in a world that has for many people become increasingly obscure , we ’ re seeing a remarkable revival in conspiracy theories , ” kampling said .
for him , brown ’ s writing is , of course , rubbish . so , how should the book be dealt with ?
kampling recommends not giving this “ umberto eco for secondary school pupils ” undue importance by getting upset about it . german editor schneider does n't get what all the fuss is about anyway , “ because it says in big letters on the book ’ s cover that it ’ s a novel . ” and even vatican radio has come around .
it said the cardinal was not speaking for the vatican , but rather expressing his own opinion .
there could be no talk of a boycott appeal on the part of the vatican . oliver samson -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oh lord , what freaks !

" we 've now succeeded in completely doing away with borders , " proclaimed former dutch defense minister wim van eekelen .
ten years ago , in the tiny luxembourgian border town of schengen , the treaty signed by france , germany and the benelux countries came into effect , making borderless travel possible . since then , thousands of tourists have made a point of visiting the tiny village .

" we 've now succeeded in completely doing away with borders , " proclaimed former dutch defense minister wim van eekelen .
ten years ago , in the tiny luxembourgian border town of schengen , the treaty signed by france , germany and the benelux countries came into effect , making borderless travel possible . since then , thousands of tourists have made a point of visiting the tiny village .

for a decade now , borderless travel through 12 eu states has been a reality , thanks to the schengen agreement . it finally happened on march 26 , 1995 .
" we 've now succeeded in completely doing away with borders , " proclaimed former dutch defense minister wim van eekelen .
ten years ago , in the tiny luxembourgian border town of schengen , the treaty signed by france , germany and the benelux countries came into effect , making borderless travel possible . since then , thousands of tourists have made a point of visiting the tiny village .
there , they find a memorial , and now , a small info-center .
mayor roger weber is pleased that schengen has achieved international recognition because of its association with travel freedom . " sure , we 're proud that the agreement was signed in schengen , " he beams .
" it was actually more of a coincidence , but we 're happy that it happened here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to schengen back then , officials were on the lookout for a border crossing for the five founding states : germany , france , belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg .
since luxembourg was holding the rotating eu council presidency at the time , the choice fell on the tiny village on the mosel river .
the introduction of total freedom of travel was an experiment , beyond the actual agreements of the european union . at the core of the eu identity now , schengen belongs to the core of the european identity .
twelve of the 25 eu states have signed the agreement .
hardly any eu citizens have to show their papers at the eu 's borders these days .
only the british and irish have to prove their identities upon crossing over to continental europe as , due to their island status , they did n't join the schengen agreement . on the other hand , norway and iceland - both not members of the eu - have joined the schengen club .
switzerland too , recently decided to join .
the newest member states in eastern europe are also meant to soon add their signatures .
in return , the eu commission has promised its support in building up security on the eu 's new external borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's interior minister patrick dewael , left , talks with his german counterpart otto schilly , center , and luxembourg 's justice minister luc frieden , as they agreed on the " schengen iii declaration " , in brussels , friday may 28 , 2004 .

the digital cameras , which will also record sound , will be added to seven double-decker buses taking children to and from secondary schools .
derbyshire county council is giving bus operators £ 2,000 for each system .
they each have two cameras on the upper deck , two on the lower deck , one in the stairwell and one by the drivers ' door .
' encourage travel ' the seven buses serve eckington school , lady manners school in bakewell , meadows community school in chesterfield , springwell community school in staveley , mortimer wilson school in alfreton , swanwick hall school and heritage community school in clowne .
councillor brian lucas said : " the schools were chosen after the headteachers expressed a keen interest in taking part in the pilot project and not because they have particular problems . "
" these cameras will act not only as a deterrent but will offer reassurance to children and hopefully encourage more parents to send their children to school on the bus rather than using the car . "
they will be used from 11 april and if the pilot scheme is a success , it will be extended to other school buses across the county .

independent candidate kieran deeney won a seat in the ni assembly over a campaign for better health services .
sdlp members in the constituency see the move as a way to unseat the current mp , sinn fein 's pat doherty .
however , mr durkan said the sdlp would have to consider wider issues than those raised in west tyrone .
he told bbc radio ulster 's inside politics on saturday : " there is a very strong ground swell of opinion in west tyrone that says the hospital issue is a classic issue that needs to be addressed in singular terms .
" there is also a very strong resentment of not just what they say is an abstentionist mp , but an absentee mp . "
in the 5 may election , dr deeny is hoping to take the seat from mr doherty and has called on all other political parties to stand aside .
the doctor topped the poll in the northern ireland assembly election of november 2003 .
dr kieran deeny polled more than 6,000 votes in west tyrone he had a surprise victory when he won a seat on a single issue ticket to save hospital services in omagh .
in february 2004 , he talked about setting up his own party .
" if i simply am seen as a protest vote , i will get nowhere , " he said at that time .
" we are trying to achieve an objective and do it politically .
already we are a party , a coalition , working towards a just objective .
there is a danger in being single issue , being limited and excluded .
" if becoming a political party is what it takes to be recognised and to be respected and to have some weight in an assembly , then we will do that . "
since his election , dr deeny has been at the centre of a campaign to reverse the decision of former health minister des browne to remove acute hospital services from tyrone .

state islamic departments have been told to seek permission from the police before launching raids to catch muslims alleged to be committing immoral acts .
one state has disbanded a youth snoop squad that was told to spy on couples .
a coalition of human rights , labour and women 's groups called on the government to stop the spread of moral policing .
their protest was prompted in part by a raid in january by the kuala lumpur islamic department on a fashionable nightclub .
dozens of young muslim women later claimed they had been harassed by religious officers asking intimate questions and requesting dates .
the government has now decided that future raids will have to be sanctioned and closely monitored by senior police officers .
meanwhile , melaka 's chief minister , mohammed ali rustam , has stood down a snoop squad he had instigated to monitor the behaviour of muslim couples in the state .
the cabinet had ordered the unit be disbanded .
the 60-strong squad organised by the local 4b youth movement had already turned in a number of people to the religious authorities for kalwat , the offence of a man and a woman being alone together in private .
however , the suggestion that the squad 's activities be extended to non-muslims had caused considerable concern among malaysia 's religious minorities .
the squad 's future had already been called into question by news that one of the youth movement 's leaders had himself been found guilty of illegally entering into a polygamous marriage .

speaking on the 60th anniversary of lloyd george 's death , bbc political editor andrew marr said the welsh wizard " would not last five minutes " in westminster now .
historians and descendants of lloyd george agreed the former prime minister would have found the power of the modern press difficult to deal with .
during his 50-year career as an mp , lloyd george led the country to victory in world war i and is credited with founding the welfare state .
he also became a lord shortly before he died in 1945 .
speaking ahead of saturday 's 60th anniversary of lloyd george 's death , many experts asked by the bbc wales news website felt that rumours over affairs and scandals - particularly one over accepting money for honours - would have brought his career to an abrupt end .
" there is no way he would have lasted five minutes , " said mr marr .
" given his background in sexual activities and using the honours system creatively , he would have been eviscerated - hung upside down - by the press . "
i think he would be a very great force today - he would have survived in the present political climate nephew dr william george mr marr added that lloyd george was a brilliant speaker , and it should be assumed that he would have adapted to television , but that he would have needed " a spin doctor of creativity and force not yet seen " to keep him in power .
historian deirdre beddoe agreed that the press would have picked up on his " standards of sexual behaviour " .
she added : " he would n't get away with half of what he got away with now - they had a much more restrained press .
" i am a great admirer , but there is n't much call for oratory skills apart from at conferences these days .
" you have to think he may have been away from westminster now - as a fervent nationalist , perhaps he would be seen better in the context of the welsh assembly . "
lloyd george walking with winston churchill in 1910 leading liberal historian alun wyburn-powell added the welsh wizard would have " hated the discipline of a modern political party " , but that he would have found his place .
" today lloyd george would stand out as an energetic visionary fundraiser , excellent on attracting media attention , " he said .
" his skills could probably be most useful today as overseas development secretary - fighting to raise the profile of a crucial cause such as africa , but spending most of the time out of the country . "
lloyd george was the last liberal prime minister , and after the coalition between the conservatives and the liberals collapsed following the first world war , the party began a rapid decline .
he continued to lead them until 1931 , but at a time when the labour party was gaining strength .
his nephew dr william george said he would have stayed loyal to the liberal party , and said he would have welcomed the welsh assembly , but opposed the war in iraq .
" i think he would be a very great force today - he would have survived in the present political climate , " he said .
' enchanting man ' however , his grandson viscount tenby , now an crossbencher in the house of lords , said lloyd george " was never a great party man " but agreed his skills were timeless .
" he was from an era of great orators - i remember him as an enchanting man , " he said .
" the thing that made him stand out was that , politicians now effect an interest in people , but it was n't feigned in his case - i think that is remarkable . "
as for potential scandals , viscount tenby said the political climate had changed now .
" i think people handled these things very differently in those days - now everyone salivates at the least bit of scandal , " he said .

speaking on the 60th anniversary of lloyd george 's death , bbc political editor andrew marr said the welsh wizard " would not last five minutes " in westminster now .
historians and descendants of lloyd george agreed the former prime minister would have found the power of the modern press difficult to deal with .
during his 50-year career as an mp , lloyd george led the country to victory in world war i and is credited with founding the welfare state .
he also became a lord shortly before he died in 1945 .
speaking ahead of saturday 's 60th anniversary of lloyd george 's death , many experts asked by the bbc wales news website felt that rumours over affairs and scandals - particularly one over accepting money for honours - would have brought his career to an abrupt end .
" there is no way he would have lasted five minutes , " said mr marr .
" given his background in sexual activities and using the honours system creatively , he would have been eviscerated - hung upside down - by the press . "
i think he would be a very great force today - he would have survived in the present political climate nephew dr william george mr marr added that lloyd george was a brilliant speaker , and it should be assumed that he would have adapted to television , but that he would have needed " a spin doctor of creativity and force not yet seen " to keep him in power .
historian deirdre beddoe agreed that the press would have picked up on his " standards of sexual behaviour " .
she added : " he would n't get away with half of what he got away with now - they had a much more restrained press .
" i am a great admirer , but there is n't much call for oratory skills apart from at conferences these days .
" you have to think he may have been away from westminster now - as a fervent nationalist , perhaps he would be seen better in the context of the welsh assembly . "
lloyd george walking with winston churchill in 1910 leading liberal historian alun wyburn-powell added the welsh wizard would have " hated the discipline of a modern political party " , but that he would have found his place .
" today lloyd george would stand out as an energetic visionary fundraiser , excellent on attracting media attention , " he said .
" his skills could probably be most useful today as overseas development secretary - fighting to raise the profile of a crucial cause such as africa , but spending most of the time out of the country . "
lloyd george was the last liberal prime minister , and after the coalition between the conservatives and the liberals collapsed following the first world war , the party began a rapid decline .
he continued to lead them until 1931 , but at a time when the labour party was gaining strength .

a roadside rock , daubed with the king of rock and roll 's name , had for decades greeted drivers as they made their way into aberystwyth .
recently the rock face was chipped away and many who remembered the landmark contacted the bbc earlier this year .
but someone has carved and painted the rock again and , like the real elvis , it has made a comeback .
the rock , on the a44 , has been given a new flat face and , in white paint , elvis has been immortalised in mid wales once again . "
the landmark is a symbol of our age and a reminder of our great hero elvis the pelvis " one of the founders of the rock , david meredith who exactly is responsible for the new elvis rock is not known .
equally , it is unclear who destroyed the original .
when the elvis rock disappeared earlier this year , people contacted the bbc and said they want to see the music legend 's aberystwyth rock again , as did the men responsible for painting it more than 40 years ago .
john hefin , from borth , in ceredigion , a former head of drama at bbc wales , and his friend david meredith , from llanuwchllyn , near bala , first painted the rock in 1962 .
they had written ' elis ' on the rock in support of a politician , but days later their handiwork had been altered to read , ' elvis ' .
mr meredith was pleased the elvis rock had re-emerged .
" i am delighted , " he said .
" although elis was changed to elvis i 'm pleased it 's been reinstated as a beacon of light on plynlimon .

almost 1,400 cases were reported to the health protection agency in the first 10 weeks of 2005 , compared with around 1,700 in the whole of last year .
experts say the cases are among young people who have missed the combined mmr jab , which was introduced in 1988 .
they say those who have not been vaccinated should stay away from people they know with mumps .
dr meirion evans , consultant epidemiologist with the national public health service for wales , said the rise in cases of mumps could be traced back to the beginning of 2004 , when figures were quite high .
" most of the people affected are older teenagers and young twenties and , thankfully , in that age group symptoms are by and large quite mild , " said dr evans . "
if you know someone who has got mumps and you know you have never had the jab yourself , stay away from them " dr meirion evans " it 's mainly explained by the fact that the mmr vaccine , which protects against mumps , came in at the end of 1988 so many people in this age group wo n't have had the vaccine offered to them as babies . "
a small proportion of youngster today have not had the mmr jab and dr evans said that means there will be another group of teenagers in the future who have not been protected against mumps .
dr evans issued advice for people at risk of contracting mumps .
" firstly , if you know someone who has got mumps and you know you have never had the jab yourself , stay away from them , " he said .
" secondly , the mmr vaccine is still available to people of that age and where there have been outbreaks at universities or schools often a local programme has been commenced to offer it . "

last week 's commons committee report also called for re-examination of ' taboo ' subjects such as cloning and implanting animal cells into humans .
cardinal cormac murphy o 'connor said on saturday this would lead down " a very , very dangerous path " .
he also paid tribute to the pope in the interview on bbc radio 4 's today show .
is it not right that citizens of this country should consider these matters and question their parliamentary candidates ?
cardinal cormac murphy o 'connor parents ' could pick babies ' sex ' on thursday the commons science and technology committee published their report saying there was no " compelling evidence " to prohibit couples undergoing ivf being able to choose to have a girl or boy to " balance out " their family .
it also looked at other issues across the field of reproductive health .
" in many ways i was horrified by their recommendations that there should be - as it were - experimentation on human embryos , cloning , gender selection and so on , " the cardinal said .
" it seemed to me that we were going a very , very dangerous path . "
faith leaders should be more intimately involved with the policy-making process on these issues , he said .
" science has made such advances that we really need to think about it very , very carefully . "
us-style politics cardinal o 'connor sparked a debate on abortion earlier this month when he spoke out in support of tory leader michael howard 's view that the legal time limit should be reduced to 20 weeks .
he was later backed by the archbishop of canterbury , rowan williams , who also said there should be an urgent review of the law .
the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to change abortion law , saying it should be a matter for a free vote , and conscience .
cardinal o 'connor will return to the subject during saturday 's easter mass .
