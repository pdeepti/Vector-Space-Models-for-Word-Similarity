many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?

germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .

we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?
but i repeat : the relationship today is one of friends and allies : it has never been better . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wwii - 60 years on dw-world 's dossier on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

at a cemetery at the southern dutch town of margraten , where over 8,000 us soldiers lie buried , bush and queen beatrix of the netherlands laid a wreath , gunshots rang out in salute and a bugler played the last post . military planes flew overhead in a " missing man " formation , where one plane breaks away from the group to signify a fallen comrade . " we recommend ourselves to the great truth that they defended , that freedom is the birthright of all mankind , " bush said in tribute .
even today , the president said , " americans and europeans are continuing to work together and bringing freedom to places where it has long been denied : in afghanistan , in iraq , in lebanon and across the broader middle east .

" we can not today allow historical reality to be manipulated once again .
we will not change history , but we can overcome its legacy , " he said at poland 's main official ceremony in the southwest city of wroclaw . kwasniewski has been criticized in poland for planning to attend the climax of the europe-wide celebrations monday in moscow , when up to 60 world leaders including bush are to watch a military parade in red square . estonian prime minister andrus ansip called in tallinn for reconciliation , noting that while his nation was invaded during the war and ruled from moscow afterward , atrocities were also committed on its territory against jews . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president : we will never forget germany is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the nazi surrender in wwii sunday with celebrations of its hard-won democracy , but the day threatens to be overshadowed by a major neo-nazi protest .

in 1909 the catholic youth group " trinity parish " decided to form the " ballspiel-verein borussia 09 " , very much to the annoyance of local chaplain hubert dewald .
the father tried to prevent the " rebels " from founding the club – in vain .
he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .
in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .
the team finished second in the bundesliga thus qualifying for the uefa cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalenstadion the high aims of president dr. gerd niebaum and other club officials led to the launch of a unique project in german football : the transfer of the stadium ground to the westfalenstadion dortmund gmbh & co .
kg -lrb- public limited society -rrb- .
this act was supposed to enable the officials to act independently ; the stadium was enlarged to about 70,000 standing and seating without any financial support of the city council .
at that time nobody could or would foresee the financial desaster the club would have to face years later .
for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .
charlton conveyed fairness and friendship to both groups and got a positive response .
bvb reached the final of the champions league where they beat juventus turin 3-1 .

the brasilian was the team ’ s hero for one season but then suffered from various injuries and finally left for málaga on a free transfer .
in the season of 2000 officials called up udo lattek and matthias sammer as coaches to prevent crisis- stricken dortmund from being relegated .
the two coaches managed to keep the club in the league .
however , the next step into financial crisis was to come : on october 31st .
bvb went public .
at first this seemed to be a sensible decision as one month later the club announced record earnings of 184,4 million dm .
in november 2001 , however , the bvb-share had dropped to 5,18 € .
in february 2005 club officials confirmed that the financial situation threatened the club ’ s existence .
as part of the emergency plan the westfalenstadion was sold in order to prevent the bankruptcy .
dortmund fans will never forget the worry they went through in the past months when bankruptcy brought the club to the brink of having to fold .
the lessons will have been learnt for the future . nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

disagreements between the soviets and the british and americans foreshadowed the divide to come . at the end of wwii , germany was a wasteland .
its crown cities were bombed to the ground ; its factories and infrastructure in ruins ; its populace scrounging for food and living in shacks .

in 1909 the catholic youth group " trinity parish " decided to form the " ballspiel-verein borussia 09 " , very much to the annoyance of local chaplain hubert dewald .
the father tried to prevent the " rebels " from founding the club – in vain .
he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .
in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .
the team finished second in the bundesliga thus qualifying for the uefa cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalenstadion the high aims of president dr. gerd niebaum and other club officials led to the launch of a unique project in german football : the transfer of the stadium ground to the westfalenstadion dortmund gmbh & co .
kg -lrb- public limited society -rrb- .
this act was supposed to enable the officials to act independently ; the stadium was enlarged to about 70,000 standing and seating without any financial support of the city council .
at that time nobody could or would foresee the financial desaster the club would have to face years later .
for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .
charlton conveyed fairness and friendship to both groups and got a positive response .
bvb reached the final of the champions league where they beat juventus turin 3-1 .

the brasilian was the team ’ s hero for one season but then suffered from various injuries and finally left for málaga on a free transfer .
in the season of 2000 officials called up udo lattek and matthias sammer as coaches to prevent crisis- stricken dortmund from being relegated .
the two coaches managed to keep the club in the league .
however , the next step into financial crisis was to come : on october 31st .
bvb went public .
at first this seemed to be a sensible decision as one month later the club announced record earnings of 184,4 million dm .
in november 2001 , however , the bvb-share had dropped to 5,18 € .
in february 2005 club officials confirmed that the financial situation threatened the club ’ s existence .
as part of the emergency plan the westfalenstadion was sold in order to prevent the bankruptcy .
dortmund fans will never forget the worry they went through in the past months when bankruptcy brought the club to the brink of having to fold .
the lessons will have been learnt for the future . nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live quadriga we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?
but i repeat : the relationship today is one of friends and allies : it has never been better . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wwii - 60 years on dw-world 's dossier on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .
the team finished second in the bundesliga thus qualifying for the uefa cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalenstadion the high aims of president dr. gerd niebaum and other club officials led to the launch of a unique project in german football : the transfer of the stadium ground to the westfalenstadion dortmund gmbh & co .
kg -lrb- public limited society -rrb- .
this act was supposed to enable the officials to act independently ; the stadium was enlarged to about 70,000 standing and seating without any financial support of the city council .
at that time nobody could or would foresee the financial desaster the club would have to face years later .
for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .
charlton conveyed fairness and friendship to both groups and got a positive response .
bvb reached the final of the champions league where they beat juventus turin 3-1 .

the brasilian was the team ’ s hero for one season but then suffered from various injuries and finally left for málaga on a free transfer .
in the season of 2000 officials called up udo lattek and matthias sammer as coaches to prevent crisis- stricken dortmund from being relegated .
the two coaches managed to keep the club in the league .
however , the next step into financial crisis was to come : on october 31st .
bvb went public .
at first this seemed to be a sensible decision as one month later the club announced record earnings of 184,4 million dm .
in november 2001 , however , the bvb-share had dropped to 5,18 € .
in february 2005 club officials confirmed that the financial situation threatened the club ’ s existence .
as part of the emergency plan the westfalenstadion was sold in order to prevent the bankruptcy .
dortmund fans will never forget the worry they went through in the past months when bankruptcy brought the club to the brink of having to fold .
the lessons will have been learnt for the future . nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live global 3000 we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

disagreements between the soviets and the british and americans foreshadowed the divide to come . at the end of wwii , germany was a wasteland .
its crown cities were bombed to the ground ; its factories and infrastructure in ruins ; its populace scrounging for food and living in shacks .
but if they expected any sympathy from the victorious allies , they were badly mistaken .
" germany is in debt to all those nations whose industries it plundered during the war , " sir brian robertson , the deputy british military governor , said in a radio address at the time . the conquering allies - russia , great britain and the united states - began to dismantle german companies in an effort to bring the country 's industry back to the level it was at in 1932 .
a total of 1,800 factories were packaged and taken away , all in the name of reparations . but a conflict soon arose between the three powers .
whereas great britain and the us wanted germany to begin sustaining itself , stalin was adamant about making the germans pay for the war they started . the birth of planned economies in the east at the same time , the soviets began recruiting german political supporters for their plans for a planned economy .
in berlin 's communist-controlled municipal assembly socialist josef orlopp called for the nationalization of large companies - an idea strongly supported by the soviets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin at the time of capitulation .
the city would soon illustrate the diverging opinions the russians and americans and british had on german economic recovery " the bill at hand … aims at placing common interests and the people 's political will over entrepreneurs ' private capitalist power , " orlopp said . the allied powers had agreed to treat germany as an economic entity at the war conference in potsdam .
but russian moves soon indicated different intentions . though the allied powers had agreed to treat germany as an economic entity at the war conference in potsdam , the soviets had their own plans . beginning in the summer of 1945 , the soviets began expropriating the owners of large estates .
their land was redistributed to small-scale farmers and refugees who at a later stage gave in to government pressure to form large collective farms .
industrial companies were nationalized . dismantlement and reparations led to a rapid decline of the economy in the soviet occupied zone germany allowed to help itself the americans and the british followed this development with suspicion , as they did the control the soviet union had begun to exert over central and eastern europe .
in an attempt to stop communism from expanding the us then made a 180 degree turn on their approach to postwar germany . in a historic speech , us secretary of state james f. byrnes on sept .
6 , 1946 encouraged germany to help itself back on its feet .
" the american people want to return the government of germany and the people of germany to win their way back to an honorable state among the free and peace-loving people of the world , " byrnes said .
the first step on this path was the reconstruction of the german economy .
in this context the american occupying force made the other allies an offer to participate in unified economic zones in germany . by jan .
1 , 1947 the british and the americans had merged their occupying zones to what was to be called the " unified economic area . "
the germans called it the " bi-zone . "
more than two years later the french zone joined , and the tri-zone was formed . the marshall plan - political divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1947 watercolor portrait of george c. marshall by e.h. baker just five months later , us secretary of state george c. marshall -lrb- photo -rrb- called for american assistance in restoring the economic infrastructure of europe .
western europe responded favorably , and the truman administration proposed the marshall plan legislation . the resulting economic cooperation act of 1948 aimed at restoring european agricultural and industrial productivity .
it was also designed as an anti-communist measure .
western germany received $ 1.5 billion to rebuild coal and steel production , power generation and other industries .
the soviets ordered the eastern european countries , who were also offered economic help , not to accept any .
the turning point in the two halves of germany was reached in 1948 .
in the soviet zone , the government introduced a centralized planned economy as well as a new east german currency .
in the west , new bank notes - the deutsch mark - were also handed out .
the country 's economic divide was complete .
only one year later the political divide followed , with the founding of two , separate german states . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush ruffles russian feathers us president george w. bush heads to europe friday for the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?

germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.05.2005 nazi past lives on in berlin 's buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport : a prime example of the architecture of the nazi era the nazis left a lasting imprint on the berlin landscape , with ministries , airports and even bunkers in their signature bombastic style .
many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?
but i repeat : the relationship today is one of friends and allies : it has never been better . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wwii - 60 years on dw-world 's dossier on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?
but i repeat : the relationship today is one of friends and allies : it has never been better . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wwii - 60 years on dw-world 's dossier on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .

the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?

in 1909 the catholic youth group " trinity parish " decided to form the " ballspiel-verein borussia 09 " , very much to the annoyance of local chaplain hubert dewald .
the father tried to prevent the " rebels " from founding the club – in vain .
he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .
in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .
the team finished second in the bundesliga thus qualifying for the uefa cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalenstadion the high aims of president dr. gerd niebaum and other club officials led to the launch of a unique project in german football : the transfer of the stadium ground to the westfalenstadion dortmund gmbh & co .
kg -lrb- public limited society -rrb- .
this act was supposed to enable the officials to act independently ; the stadium was enlarged to about 70,000 standing and seating without any financial support of the city council .
at that time nobody could or would foresee the financial desaster the club would have to face years later .
for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .
charlton conveyed fairness and friendship to both groups and got a positive response .
bvb reached the final of the champions league where they beat juventus turin 3-1 .

the brasilian was the team ’ s hero for one season but then suffered from various injuries and finally left for málaga on a free transfer .
in the season of 2000 officials called up udo lattek and matthias sammer as coaches to prevent crisis- stricken dortmund from being relegated .
the two coaches managed to keep the club in the league .
however , the next step into financial crisis was to come : on october 31st .
bvb went public .
at first this seemed to be a sensible decision as one month later the club announced record earnings of 184,4 million dm .
in november 2001 , however , the bvb-share had dropped to 5,18 € .
in february 2005 club officials confirmed that the financial situation threatened the club ’ s existence .
as part of the emergency plan the westfalenstadion was sold in order to prevent the bankruptcy .
dortmund fans will never forget the worry they went through in the past months when bankruptcy brought the club to the brink of having to fold .
the lessons will have been learnt for the future . nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the father tried to prevent the " rebels " from founding the club – in vain .
he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .
in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .

at that time nobody could or would foresee the financial desaster the club would have to face years later .
for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .

disagreements between the soviets and the british and americans foreshadowed the divide to come . at the end of wwii , germany was a wasteland .
its crown cities were bombed to the ground ; its factories and infrastructure in ruins ; its populace scrounging for food and living in shacks .
but if they expected any sympathy from the victorious allies , they were badly mistaken .
" germany is in debt to all those nations whose industries it plundered during the war , " sir brian robertson , the deputy british military governor , said in a radio address at the time . the conquering allies - russia , great britain and the united states - began to dismantle german companies in an effort to bring the country 's industry back to the level it was at in 1932 .
a total of 1,800 factories were packaged and taken away , all in the name of reparations . but a conflict soon arose between the three powers .
whereas great britain and the us wanted germany to begin sustaining itself , stalin was adamant about making the germans pay for the war they started . the birth of planned economies in the east at the same time , the soviets began recruiting german political supporters for their plans for a planned economy .
in berlin 's communist-controlled municipal assembly socialist josef orlopp called for the nationalization of large companies - an idea strongly supported by the soviets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin at the time of capitulation .
the city would soon illustrate the diverging opinions the russians and americans and british had on german economic recovery " the bill at hand … aims at placing common interests and the people 's political will over entrepreneurs ' private capitalist power , " orlopp said . the allied powers had agreed to treat germany as an economic entity at the war conference in potsdam .
but russian moves soon indicated different intentions . though the allied powers had agreed to treat germany as an economic entity at the war conference in potsdam , the soviets had their own plans . beginning in the summer of 1945 , the soviets began expropriating the owners of large estates .
their land was redistributed to small-scale farmers and refugees who at a later stage gave in to government pressure to form large collective farms .
industrial companies were nationalized . dismantlement and reparations led to a rapid decline of the economy in the soviet occupied zone germany allowed to help itself the americans and the british followed this development with suspicion , as they did the control the soviet union had begun to exert over central and eastern europe .
in an attempt to stop communism from expanding the us then made a 180 degree turn on their approach to postwar germany . in a historic speech , us secretary of state james f. byrnes on sept .
6 , 1946 encouraged germany to help itself back on its feet .
" the american people want to return the government of germany and the people of germany to win their way back to an honorable state among the free and peace-loving people of the world , " byrnes said .
the first step on this path was the reconstruction of the german economy .
in this context the american occupying force made the other allies an offer to participate in unified economic zones in germany . by jan .
1 , 1947 the british and the americans had merged their occupying zones to what was to be called the " unified economic area . "
the germans called it the " bi-zone . "
more than two years later the french zone joined , and the tri-zone was formed . the marshall plan - political divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1947 watercolor portrait of george c. marshall by e.h. baker just five months later , us secretary of state george c. marshall -lrb- photo -rrb- called for american assistance in restoring the economic infrastructure of europe .
western europe responded favorably , and the truman administration proposed the marshall plan legislation . the resulting economic cooperation act of 1948 aimed at restoring european agricultural and industrial productivity .
it was also designed as an anti-communist measure .
western germany received $ 1.5 billion to rebuild coal and steel production , power generation and other industries .
the soviets ordered the eastern european countries , who were also offered economic help , not to accept any .
the turning point in the two halves of germany was reached in 1948 .
in the soviet zone , the government introduced a centralized planned economy as well as a new east german currency .
in the west , new bank notes - the deutsch mark - were also handed out .
the country 's economic divide was complete .

in 1909 the catholic youth group " trinity parish " decided to form the " ballspiel-verein borussia 09 " , very much to the annoyance of local chaplain hubert dewald .
the father tried to prevent the " rebels " from founding the club – in vain .
he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .
in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .
the team finished second in the bundesliga thus qualifying for the uefa cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalenstadion the high aims of president dr. gerd niebaum and other club officials led to the launch of a unique project in german football : the transfer of the stadium ground to the westfalenstadion dortmund gmbh & co .
kg -lrb- public limited society -rrb- .
this act was supposed to enable the officials to act independently ; the stadium was enlarged to about 70,000 standing and seating without any financial support of the city council .
at that time nobody could or would foresee the financial desaster the club would have to face years later .
for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .
charlton conveyed fairness and friendship to both groups and got a positive response .
bvb reached the final of the champions league where they beat juventus turin 3-1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund's christoph metzelder , florian kringe , czech scorer thomas rosicky , czech player jan koller and brazilian player ewerthon , from left , celebrate during the german first division soccer match between borussia dortmund and werder bremen eager to repeat this triumph bvb subsequently effected very expensive transactions culminating in the signing of marcio amoroso from parma in 2001 for the record transfer fee of 25 million euros .
the brasilian was the team ’ s hero for one season but then suffered from various injuries and finally left for málaga on a free transfer .
in the season of 2000 officials called up udo lattek and matthias sammer as coaches to prevent crisis- stricken dortmund from being relegated .
the two coaches managed to keep the club in the league .
however , the next step into financial crisis was to come : on october 31st .
bvb went public .
at first this seemed to be a sensible decision as one month later the club announced record earnings of 184,4 million dm .
in november 2001 , however , the bvb-share had dropped to 5,18 € .
in february 2005 club officials confirmed that the financial situation threatened the club ’ s existence .
as part of the emergency plan the westfalenstadion was sold in order to prevent the bankruptcy .
dortmund fans will never forget the worry they went through in the past months when bankruptcy brought the club to the brink of having to fold .
the lessons will have been learnt for the future . nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?
but i repeat : the relationship today is one of friends and allies : it has never been better . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wwii - 60 years on dw-world 's dossier on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .

it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .

once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .

many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .

earlier this year , the national front leader jean-marie le pen described the wartime occupation by the germans as " not particularly inhumane " despite " some excesses . "

" now they say i 'm not hard enough on the germans .

it 's scandalous that 60 years after the war , there 's no free expression on these subjects . " le pen 's original interview was given to a far-right journal called riverol , which was started up by vichy sympathizers after the war .

" we germans look back with horror and shame , " he said during the wwii commemoration in parliament . speaking to a special assembly of both houses of germany 's parliament on sunday to mark the 60th anniversary of the surrender of nazi germany and the end of wwii , german president horst köhler warned germans that though the country had changed fundamentally , a final line could n't be drawn under germany 's past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler speaks in the bundestag on sunday , may 8 köhler said that the tragedy that germany had inflicted upon the world , continued till today .
people are still suffering from their experiences of that time and innumerable people are still mourning the loss of their homelands , köhler said . " we germans remember with horror and shame the second world war unleashed by germany and the holocaust , this breakdown in civilisation , for which germans are reponsible . and we remember the six million jews who were killed with a fiendish energy , " köhler said in front of representatives of the bundestag or lower house of parliament and the bundesrat , the upper house . " we have the responsibility to keep alive the memory of the agony and its causes , and we must ensure that it never returns , " köhler said . but germans had every reason to be proud of their country 's modern-day democratic reincarnation , köhler added . " we ask for forgiveness " the president 's speech was the centerpiece of two days of commemorations in germany to mark 60 years of the end of nazi germany and the second world war as celebrations marking ve day continued throughout the continent this weekend . bildunterschrift : the ecumenical service in berlin on sunday to mark 60 years of the end of wwii on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and president horst köhler , accompanied by high-ranking politicians and members of parliament , attended an ecumenical remembrance service in a berlin cathedral . german cardinal karl lehmann said in his homily that the 8th of may 1945 marked not just the end of the rule of terror , but the start of a new beginning .
he noted also that it was the people of eastern europe who suffered most under the burden of the crimes committed during the second world war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getman chancellor schröder along with president köhler outside the neue wache , germany 's central war memorial from there , the congregation moved across unter den linden boulevard to germany 's central war memorial the neue wache . in a simple ceremony , wreaths were laid by the heads of germany 's five main democratic institutions : the federal president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , the two heads of the chambers of parliament and the head of the consitutional court . earlier , in an article in russia 's komsomolskaya pravda newspaper , chancellor schröder asked for forgiveness for his country 's sins . " today , we ask for forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans , " he wrote , while stressing how far relations had developed since then . on saturday , thousands of people braved the rain and cold to take to the streets of berlin saturday night to form a chain of light to promise that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , germany would never again be the source of war , far right politics and racism . bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate on sunday a colorful alliance of churches , leftist radicals , sports stars , celebrity chefs and national politicians were to take part in events on sunday , may 8 , dubbed as a " festival of democracy . "
stars such as former tennis player boris becker and actor bruno ganz , who played hitler in a hit film about the dictator last year , were to address the crowd at the brandenburg gate . on tuesday , a monument to the holocaust , with 2,711 anthracite gray pillars representing the genocide of the jews , will be inaugurated near the brandenburg gate . neo-nazis risked embarrassing berlin event but , the occasion was clouded by a huge gathering of neo-nazis who were planning a march in the german capital and possible counter-actions by extreme leftists . bildunterschrift : npd supporters at berlin 's alexanderplatz on sunday police said around 3,000 protestors from the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- had gathered in the alexanderplatz square in eastern berlin . many had come from countries like sweden and romania .
riot police surrounded the npd demonstrators in a bid to prevent clashes with an estimated 10,000 left-wing protesters who had marched across the city in a counter-protest . in the end , however , the police cancelled the planned march because of the risk of clashes . earlier the npd said it wanted " an end to the cult of guilt " after " 60 years of lies " . on friday , germany 's constitutional court reaffirmed a ban on neo-nazi demonstrations near the holocaust memorial which is to be officially unveiled next week . the npd was instead allowed to march from berlin 's alexanderplatz in the east of the city to a train station a few blocks from the brandenburg gate .
their path would have taken them past a memorial for victims of the war , but only after politicians lay wreaths at the monument . " prepared to fight for democracy " berlin mayor klaus wowereit on saturday urged young people to assemble in a show of democracy against the right-wing extremists .
" we must remain vigilant , " the social-democrat mayor said , calling for the defense of democracy " with democratic means . " there will be " a mixture of commemoration and celebration .
we are prepared , if necessary , to fight for democracy , " wowereit said . interior minister otto schily urged the germans to show proof of " civic courage " in opposing the neo-nazis , and said he found it encouraging that so many young people were rising in opposition to the extremists . one of the leaders of the ruling social democrats , ottmar schreiner , said that all school pupils should obligatorily be made to visit a concentration camp .

" we germans look back with horror and shame , " he said during the wwii commemoration in parliament . speaking to a special assembly of both houses of germany 's parliament on sunday to mark the 60th anniversary of the surrender of nazi germany and the end of wwii , german president horst köhler warned germans that though the country had changed fundamentally , a final line could n't be drawn under germany 's past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler speaks in the bundestag on sunday , may 8 köhler said that the tragedy that germany had inflicted upon the world , continued till today .
people are still suffering from their experiences of that time and innumerable people are still mourning the loss of their homelands , köhler said . " we germans remember with horror and shame the second world war unleashed by germany and the holocaust , this breakdown in civilisation , for which germans are reponsible . and we remember the six million jews who were killed with a fiendish energy , " köhler said in front of representatives of the bundestag or lower house of parliament and the bundesrat , the upper house . " we have the responsibility to keep alive the memory of the agony and its causes , and we must ensure that it never returns , " köhler said . but germans had every reason to be proud of their country 's modern-day democratic reincarnation , köhler added . " we ask for forgiveness " the president 's speech was the centerpiece of two days of commemorations in germany to mark 60 years of the end of nazi germany and the second world war as celebrations marking ve day continued throughout the continent this weekend . bildunterschrift : the ecumenical service in berlin on sunday to mark 60 years of the end of wwii on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and president horst köhler , accompanied by high-ranking politicians and members of parliament , attended an ecumenical remembrance service in a berlin cathedral . german cardinal karl lehmann said in his homily that the 8th of may 1945 marked not just the end of the rule of terror , but the start of a new beginning .
he noted also that it was the people of eastern europe who suffered most under the burden of the crimes committed during the second world war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getman chancellor schröder along with president köhler outside the neue wache , germany 's central war memorial from there , the congregation moved across unter den linden boulevard to germany 's central war memorial the neue wache . in a simple ceremony , wreaths were laid by the heads of germany 's five main democratic institutions : the federal president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , the two heads of the chambers of parliament and the head of the consitutional court . earlier , in an article in russia 's komsomolskaya pravda newspaper , chancellor schröder asked for forgiveness for his country 's sins . " today , we ask for forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans , " he wrote , while stressing how far relations had developed since then . on saturday , thousands of people braved the rain and cold to take to the streets of berlin saturday night to form a chain of light to promise that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , germany would never again be the source of war , far right politics and racism . bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate on sunday a colorful alliance of churches , leftist radicals , sports stars , celebrity chefs and national politicians were to take part in events on sunday , may 8 , dubbed as a " festival of democracy . "
stars such as former tennis player boris becker and actor bruno ganz , who played hitler in a hit film about the dictator last year , were to address the crowd at the brandenburg gate . on tuesday , a monument to the holocaust , with 2,711 anthracite gray pillars representing the genocide of the jews , will be inaugurated near the brandenburg gate . neo-nazis risked embarrassing berlin event but , the occasion was clouded by a huge gathering of neo-nazis who were planning a march in the german capital and possible counter-actions by extreme leftists . bildunterschrift : npd supporters at berlin 's alexanderplatz on sunday police said around 3,000 protestors from the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- had gathered in the alexanderplatz square in eastern berlin . many had come from countries like sweden and romania .
riot police surrounded the npd demonstrators in a bid to prevent clashes with an estimated 10,000 left-wing protesters who had marched across the city in a counter-protest . in the end , however , the police cancelled the planned march because of the risk of clashes . earlier the npd said it wanted " an end to the cult of guilt " after " 60 years of lies " . on friday , germany 's constitutional court reaffirmed a ban on neo-nazi demonstrations near the holocaust memorial which is to be officially unveiled next week . the npd was instead allowed to march from berlin 's alexanderplatz in the east of the city to a train station a few blocks from the brandenburg gate .
their path would have taken them past a memorial for victims of the war , but only after politicians lay wreaths at the monument . " prepared to fight for democracy " berlin mayor klaus wowereit on saturday urged young people to assemble in a show of democracy against the right-wing extremists .
" we must remain vigilant , " the social-democrat mayor said , calling for the defense of democracy " with democratic means . " there will be " a mixture of commemoration and celebration .
we are prepared , if necessary , to fight for democracy , " wowereit said . interior minister otto schily urged the germans to show proof of " civic courage " in opposing the neo-nazis , and said he found it encouraging that so many young people were rising in opposition to the extremists . one of the leaders of the ruling social democrats , ottmar schreiner , said that all school pupils should obligatorily be made to visit a concentration camp .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?
but i repeat : the relationship today is one of friends and allies : it has never been better . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wwii - 60 years on dw-world 's dossier on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .
only gradually did the french begin waking up to the truth about les annees noires - the dark years of the war .
the 1970s and 1980s saw a series of revelations about france 's wartime history . but it was n't until president jacques chirac took office that france agreed to compensate victims of the holocaust . " it took a very long time before the attitude of the vichy state was actually acknowledged , particularly what was done to the jews during the war , " said parliamentarian herve mariton . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme-right leader jean-marie le pen but even today , there are signs that not everyone accepts what has now become conventional wisdom .
earlier this year , the national front leader jean-marie le pen described the wartime occupation by the germans as " not particularly inhumane " despite " some excesses . "
his comments provoked a furor , but even in a subsequent radio interview , he refused to back down . " they say i 'm too hard on the arabs , " he said .
" now they say i 'm not hard enough on the germans .
in our country people are not free to think .
it 's scandalous that 60 years after the war , there 's no free expression on these subjects . " le pen 's original interview was given to a far-right journal called riverol , which was started up by vichy sympathizers after the war .
for some , his comments suggest traditional revisionist thinking about the wartime era is still alive and well . generational civil war yet last year 's commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the normandy landings and the liberation of paris passed without too much argument .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .
only gradually did the french begin waking up to the truth about les annees noires - the dark years of the war .
the 1970s and 1980s saw a series of revelations about france 's wartime history . but it was n't until president jacques chirac took office that france agreed to compensate victims of the holocaust . " it took a very long time before the attitude of the vichy state was actually acknowledged , particularly what was done to the jews during the war , " said parliamentarian herve mariton . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme-right leader jean-marie le pen but even today , there are signs that not everyone accepts what has now become conventional wisdom .
earlier this year , the national front leader jean-marie le pen described the wartime occupation by the germans as " not particularly inhumane " despite " some excesses . "
his comments provoked a furor , but even in a subsequent radio interview , he refused to back down . " they say i 'm too hard on the arabs , " he said .
" now they say i 'm not hard enough on the germans .
in our country people are not free to think .
it 's scandalous that 60 years after the war , there 's no free expression on these subjects . " le pen 's original interview was given to a far-right journal called riverol , which was started up by vichy sympathizers after the war .

after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .

one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .

schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .

one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .

on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .

at a cemetery at the southern dutch town of margraten , where over 8,000 us soldiers lie buried , bush and queen beatrix of the netherlands laid a wreath , gunshots rang out in salute and a bugler played the last post . military planes flew overhead in a " missing man " formation , where one plane breaks away from the group to signify a fallen comrade . " we recommend ourselves to the great truth that they defended , that freedom is the birthright of all mankind , " bush said in tribute .
even today , the president said , " americans and europeans are continuing to work together and bringing freedom to places where it has long been denied : in afghanistan , in iraq , in lebanon and across the broader middle east .

" we germans look back with horror and shame , " he said during the wwii commemoration in parliament . speaking to a special assembly of both houses of germany 's parliament on sunday to mark the 60th anniversary of the surrender of nazi germany and the end of wwii , german president horst köhler warned germans that though the country had changed fundamentally , a final line could n't be drawn under germany 's past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler speaks in the bundestag on sunday , may 8 köhler said that the tragedy that germany had inflicted upon the world , continued till today .
people are still suffering from their experiences of that time and innumerable people are still mourning the loss of their homelands , köhler said . " we germans remember with horror and shame the second world war unleashed by germany and the holocaust , this breakdown in civilisation , for which germans are reponsible . and we remember the six million jews who were killed with a fiendish energy , " köhler said in front of representatives of the bundestag or lower house of parliament and the bundesrat , the upper house . " we have the responsibility to keep alive the memory of the agony and its causes , and we must ensure that it never returns , " köhler said . but germans had every reason to be proud of their country 's modern-day democratic reincarnation , köhler added . " we ask for forgiveness " the president 's speech was the centerpiece of two days of commemorations in germany to mark 60 years of the end of nazi germany and the second world war as celebrations marking ve day continued throughout the continent this weekend . bildunterschrift : the ecumenical service in berlin on sunday to mark 60 years of the end of wwii on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and president horst köhler , accompanied by high-ranking politicians and members of parliament , attended an ecumenical remembrance service in a berlin cathedral . german cardinal karl lehmann said in his homily that the 8th of may 1945 marked not just the end of the rule of terror , but the start of a new beginning .
he noted also that it was the people of eastern europe who suffered most under the burden of the crimes committed during the second world war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getman chancellor schröder along with president köhler outside the neue wache , germany 's central war memorial from there , the congregation moved across unter den linden boulevard to germany 's central war memorial the neue wache . in a simple ceremony , wreaths were laid by the heads of germany 's five main democratic institutions : the federal president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , the two heads of the chambers of parliament and the head of the consitutional court . earlier , in an article in russia 's komsomolskaya pravda newspaper , chancellor schröder asked for forgiveness for his country 's sins . " today , we ask for forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans , " he wrote , while stressing how far relations had developed since then . on saturday , thousands of people braved the rain and cold to take to the streets of berlin saturday night to form a chain of light to promise that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , germany would never again be the source of war , far right politics and racism . bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate on sunday a colorful alliance of churches , leftist radicals , sports stars , celebrity chefs and national politicians were to take part in events on sunday , may 8 , dubbed as a " festival of democracy . "
stars such as former tennis player boris becker and actor bruno ganz , who played hitler in a hit film about the dictator last year , were to address the crowd at the brandenburg gate . on tuesday , a monument to the holocaust , with 2,711 anthracite gray pillars representing the genocide of the jews , will be inaugurated near the brandenburg gate . neo-nazis risked embarrassing berlin event but , the occasion was clouded by a huge gathering of neo-nazis who were planning a march in the german capital and possible counter-actions by extreme leftists . bildunterschrift : npd supporters at berlin 's alexanderplatz on sunday police said around 3,000 protestors from the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- had gathered in the alexanderplatz square in eastern berlin . many had come from countries like sweden and romania .
riot police surrounded the npd demonstrators in a bid to prevent clashes with an estimated 10,000 left-wing protesters who had marched across the city in a counter-protest . in the end , however , the police cancelled the planned march because of the risk of clashes . earlier the npd said it wanted " an end to the cult of guilt " after " 60 years of lies " . on friday , germany 's constitutional court reaffirmed a ban on neo-nazi demonstrations near the holocaust memorial which is to be officially unveiled next week . the npd was instead allowed to march from berlin 's alexanderplatz in the east of the city to a train station a few blocks from the brandenburg gate .
their path would have taken them past a memorial for victims of the war , but only after politicians lay wreaths at the monument . " prepared to fight for democracy " berlin mayor klaus wowereit on saturday urged young people to assemble in a show of democracy against the right-wing extremists .
" we must remain vigilant , " the social-democrat mayor said , calling for the defense of democracy " with democratic means . " there will be " a mixture of commemoration and celebration .
we are prepared , if necessary , to fight for democracy , " wowereit said . interior minister otto schily urged the germans to show proof of " civic courage " in opposing the neo-nazis , and said he found it encouraging that so many young people were rising in opposition to the extremists . one of the leaders of the ruling social democrats , ottmar schreiner , said that all school pupils should obligatorily be made to visit a concentration camp .

many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?
but i repeat : the relationship today is one of friends and allies : it has never been better . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wwii - 60 years on dw-world 's dossier on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .
only gradually did the french begin waking up to the truth about les annees noires - the dark years of the war .
the 1970s and 1980s saw a series of revelations about france 's wartime history . but it was n't until president jacques chirac took office that france agreed to compensate victims of the holocaust .

earlier this year , the national front leader jean-marie le pen described the wartime occupation by the germans as " not particularly inhumane " despite " some excesses . "
his comments provoked a furor , but even in a subsequent radio interview , he refused to back down . " they say i 'm too hard on the arabs , " he said .
" now they say i 'm not hard enough on the germans .
in our country people are not free to think .
it 's scandalous that 60 years after the war , there 's no free expression on these subjects . " le pen 's original interview was given to a far-right journal called riverol , which was started up by vichy sympathizers after the war .

many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .
only gradually did the french begin waking up to the truth about les annees noires - the dark years of the war .
the 1970s and 1980s saw a series of revelations about france 's wartime history . but it was n't until president jacques chirac took office that france agreed to compensate victims of the holocaust . " it took a very long time before the attitude of the vichy state was actually acknowledged , particularly what was done to the jews during the war , " said parliamentarian herve mariton . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme-right leader jean-marie le pen but even today , there are signs that not everyone accepts what has now become conventional wisdom .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.05.2005 nazi past lives on in berlin 's buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport : a prime example of the architecture of the nazi era the nazis left a lasting imprint on the berlin landscape , with ministries , airports and even bunkers in their signature bombastic style .
many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .

with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

" we germans look back with horror and shame , " he said during the wwii commemoration in parliament . speaking to a special assembly of both houses of germany 's parliament on sunday to mark the 60th anniversary of the surrender of nazi germany and the end of wwii , german president horst köhler warned germans that though the country had changed fundamentally , a final line could n't be drawn under germany 's past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler speaks in the bundestag on sunday , may 8 köhler said that the tragedy that germany had inflicted upon the world , continued till today .
people are still suffering from their experiences of that time and innumerable people are still mourning the loss of their homelands , köhler said . " we germans remember with horror and shame the second world war unleashed by germany and the holocaust , this breakdown in civilisation , for which germans are reponsible . and we remember the six million jews who were killed with a fiendish energy , " köhler said in front of representatives of the bundestag or lower house of parliament and the bundesrat , the upper house . " we have the responsibility to keep alive the memory of the agony and its causes , and we must ensure that it never returns , " köhler said . but germans had every reason to be proud of their country 's modern-day democratic reincarnation , köhler added . " we ask for forgiveness " the president 's speech was the centerpiece of two days of commemorations in germany to mark 60 years of the end of nazi germany and the second world war as celebrations marking ve day continued throughout the continent this weekend . bildunterschrift : the ecumenical service in berlin on sunday to mark 60 years of the end of wwii on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and president horst köhler , accompanied by high-ranking politicians and members of parliament , attended an ecumenical remembrance service in a berlin cathedral . german cardinal karl lehmann said in his homily that the 8th of may 1945 marked not just the end of the rule of terror , but the start of a new beginning .
he noted also that it was the people of eastern europe who suffered most under the burden of the crimes committed during the second world war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getman chancellor schröder along with president köhler outside the neue wache , germany 's central war memorial from there , the congregation moved across unter den linden boulevard to germany 's central war memorial the neue wache . in a simple ceremony , wreaths were laid by the heads of germany 's five main democratic institutions : the federal president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , the two heads of the chambers of parliament and the head of the consitutional court . earlier , in an article in russia 's komsomolskaya pravda newspaper , chancellor schröder asked for forgiveness for his country 's sins . " today , we ask for forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans , " he wrote , while stressing how far relations had developed since then . on saturday , thousands of people braved the rain and cold to take to the streets of berlin saturday night to form a chain of light to promise that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , germany would never again be the source of war , far right politics and racism . bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate on sunday a colorful alliance of churches , leftist radicals , sports stars , celebrity chefs and national politicians were to take part in events on sunday , may 8 , dubbed as a " festival of democracy . "
stars such as former tennis player boris becker and actor bruno ganz , who played hitler in a hit film about the dictator last year , were to address the crowd at the brandenburg gate . on tuesday , a monument to the holocaust , with 2,711 anthracite gray pillars representing the genocide of the jews , will be inaugurated near the brandenburg gate . neo-nazis risked embarrassing berlin event but , the occasion was clouded by a huge gathering of neo-nazis who were planning a march in the german capital and possible counter-actions by extreme leftists . bildunterschrift : npd supporters at berlin 's alexanderplatz on sunday police said around 3,000 protestors from the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- had gathered in the alexanderplatz square in eastern berlin . many had come from countries like sweden and romania .
riot police surrounded the npd demonstrators in a bid to prevent clashes with an estimated 10,000 left-wing protesters who had marched across the city in a counter-protest . in the end , however , the police cancelled the planned march because of the risk of clashes . earlier the npd said it wanted " an end to the cult of guilt " after " 60 years of lies " . on friday , germany 's constitutional court reaffirmed a ban on neo-nazi demonstrations near the holocaust memorial which is to be officially unveiled next week . the npd was instead allowed to march from berlin 's alexanderplatz in the east of the city to a train station a few blocks from the brandenburg gate .
their path would have taken them past a memorial for victims of the war , but only after politicians lay wreaths at the monument . " prepared to fight for democracy " berlin mayor klaus wowereit on saturday urged young people to assemble in a show of democracy against the right-wing extremists .
" we must remain vigilant , " the social-democrat mayor said , calling for the defense of democracy " with democratic means . " there will be " a mixture of commemoration and celebration .
we are prepared , if necessary , to fight for democracy , " wowereit said . interior minister otto schily urged the germans to show proof of " civic courage " in opposing the neo-nazis , and said he found it encouraging that so many young people were rising in opposition to the extremists . one of the leaders of the ruling social democrats , ottmar schreiner , said that all school pupils should obligatorily be made to visit a concentration camp .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?
but i repeat : the relationship today is one of friends and allies : it has never been better . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wwii - 60 years on dw-world 's dossier on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in 1909 the catholic youth group " trinity parish " decided to form the " ballspiel-verein borussia 09 " , very much to the annoyance of local chaplain hubert dewald .
the father tried to prevent the " rebels " from founding the club – in vain .
he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .
in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .
the team finished second in the bundesliga thus qualifying for the uefa cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalenstadion the high aims of president dr. gerd niebaum and other club officials led to the launch of a unique project in german football : the transfer of the stadium ground to the westfalenstadion dortmund gmbh & co .
kg -lrb- public limited society -rrb- .
this act was supposed to enable the officials to act independently ; the stadium was enlarged to about 70,000 standing and seating without any financial support of the city council .
at that time nobody could or would foresee the financial desaster the club would have to face years later .
for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .
charlton conveyed fairness and friendship to both groups and got a positive response .

after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .

in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .

in 1909 the catholic youth group " trinity parish " decided to form the " ballspiel-verein borussia 09 " , very much to the annoyance of local chaplain hubert dewald .
the father tried to prevent the " rebels " from founding the club – in vain .
he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .
in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .
the team finished second in the bundesliga thus qualifying for the uefa cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalenstadion the high aims of president dr. gerd niebaum and other club officials led to the launch of a unique project in german football : the transfer of the stadium ground to the westfalenstadion dortmund gmbh & co .
kg -lrb- public limited society -rrb- .
this act was supposed to enable the officials to act independently ; the stadium was enlarged to about 70,000 standing and seating without any financial support of the city council .
at that time nobody could or would foresee the financial desaster the club would have to face years later .
for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .
charlton conveyed fairness and friendship to both groups and got a positive response .
bvb reached the final of the champions league where they beat juventus turin 3-1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund's christoph metzelder , florian kringe , czech scorer thomas rosicky , czech player jan koller and brazilian player ewerthon , from left , celebrate during the german first division soccer match between borussia dortmund and werder bremen eager to repeat this triumph bvb subsequently effected very expensive transactions culminating in the signing of marcio amoroso from parma in 2001 for the record transfer fee of 25 million euros .
the brasilian was the team ’ s hero for one season but then suffered from various injuries and finally left for málaga on a free transfer .
in the season of 2000 officials called up udo lattek and matthias sammer as coaches to prevent crisis- stricken dortmund from being relegated .
the two coaches managed to keep the club in the league .
however , the next step into financial crisis was to come : on october 31st .
bvb went public .
at first this seemed to be a sensible decision as one month later the club announced record earnings of 184,4 million dm .
in november 2001 , however , the bvb-share had dropped to 5,18 € .
in february 2005 club officials confirmed that the financial situation threatened the club ’ s existence .
as part of the emergency plan the westfalenstadion was sold in order to prevent the bankruptcy .
dortmund fans will never forget the worry they went through in the past months when bankruptcy brought the club to the brink of having to fold .
the lessons will have been learnt for the future . nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.05.2005 nazi past lives on in berlin 's buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport : a prime example of the architecture of the nazi era the nazis left a lasting imprint on the berlin landscape , with ministries , airports and even bunkers in their signature bombastic style .
many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .

do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .

people are still suffering from their experiences of that time and innumerable people are still mourning the loss of their homelands , köhler said . " we germans remember with horror and shame the second world war unleashed by germany and the holocaust , this breakdown in civilisation , for which germans are reponsible . and we remember the six million jews who were killed with a fiendish energy , " köhler said in front of representatives of the bundestag or lower house of parliament and the bundesrat , the upper house . " we have the responsibility to keep alive the memory of the agony and its causes , and we must ensure that it never returns , " köhler said . but germans had every reason to be proud of their country 's modern-day democratic reincarnation , köhler added . " we ask for forgiveness " the president 's speech was the centerpiece of two days of commemorations in germany to mark 60 years of the end of nazi germany and the second world war as celebrations marking ve day continued throughout the continent this weekend . bildunterschrift : the ecumenical service in berlin on sunday to mark 60 years of the end of wwii on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and president horst köhler , accompanied by high-ranking politicians and members of parliament , attended an ecumenical remembrance service in a berlin cathedral . german cardinal karl lehmann said in his homily that the 8th of may 1945 marked not just the end of the rule of terror , but the start of a new beginning .

" today , we ask for forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans , " he wrote , while stressing how far relations had developed since then . on saturday , thousands of people braved the rain and cold to take to the streets of berlin saturday night to form a chain of light to promise that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , germany would never again be the source of war , far right politics and racism . bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate on sunday a colorful alliance of churches , leftist radicals , sports stars , celebrity chefs and national politicians were to take part in events on sunday , may 8 , dubbed as a " festival of democracy . "

riot police surrounded the npd demonstrators in a bid to prevent clashes with an estimated 10,000 left-wing protesters who had marched across the city in a counter-protest . in the end , however , the police cancelled the planned march because of the risk of clashes . earlier the npd said it wanted " an end to the cult of guilt " after " 60 years of lies " . on friday , germany 's constitutional court reaffirmed a ban on neo-nazi demonstrations near the holocaust memorial which is to be officially unveiled next week . the npd was instead allowed to march from berlin 's alexanderplatz in the east of the city to a train station a few blocks from the brandenburg gate .
their path would have taken them past a memorial for victims of the war , but only after politicians lay wreaths at the monument . " prepared to fight for democracy " berlin mayor klaus wowereit on saturday urged young people to assemble in a show of democracy against the right-wing extremists .
" we must remain vigilant , " the social-democrat mayor said , calling for the defense of democracy " with democratic means . " there will be " a mixture of commemoration and celebration .

disagreements between the soviets and the british and americans foreshadowed the divide to come . at the end of wwii , germany was a wasteland .
its crown cities were bombed to the ground ; its factories and infrastructure in ruins ; its populace scrounging for food and living in shacks .
but if they expected any sympathy from the victorious allies , they were badly mistaken .
" germany is in debt to all those nations whose industries it plundered during the war , " sir brian robertson , the deputy british military governor , said in a radio address at the time . the conquering allies - russia , great britain and the united states - began to dismantle german companies in an effort to bring the country 's industry back to the level it was at in 1932 .
a total of 1,800 factories were packaged and taken away , all in the name of reparations . but a conflict soon arose between the three powers .
whereas great britain and the us wanted germany to begin sustaining itself , stalin was adamant about making the germans pay for the war they started . the birth of planned economies in the east at the same time , the soviets began recruiting german political supporters for their plans for a planned economy .
in berlin 's communist-controlled municipal assembly socialist josef orlopp called for the nationalization of large companies - an idea strongly supported by the soviets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin at the time of capitulation .
the city would soon illustrate the diverging opinions the russians and americans and british had on german economic recovery " the bill at hand … aims at placing common interests and the people 's political will over entrepreneurs ' private capitalist power , " orlopp said . the allied powers had agreed to treat germany as an economic entity at the war conference in potsdam .
but russian moves soon indicated different intentions . though the allied powers had agreed to treat germany as an economic entity at the war conference in potsdam , the soviets had their own plans . beginning in the summer of 1945 , the soviets began expropriating the owners of large estates .
their land was redistributed to small-scale farmers and refugees who at a later stage gave in to government pressure to form large collective farms .
industrial companies were nationalized . dismantlement and reparations led to a rapid decline of the economy in the soviet occupied zone germany allowed to help itself the americans and the british followed this development with suspicion , as they did the control the soviet union had begun to exert over central and eastern europe .
in an attempt to stop communism from expanding the us then made a 180 degree turn on their approach to postwar germany . in a historic speech , us secretary of state james f. byrnes on sept .
6 , 1946 encouraged germany to help itself back on its feet .
" the american people want to return the government of germany and the people of germany to win their way back to an honorable state among the free and peace-loving people of the world , " byrnes said .
the first step on this path was the reconstruction of the german economy .
in this context the american occupying force made the other allies an offer to participate in unified economic zones in germany . by jan .
1 , 1947 the british and the americans had merged their occupying zones to what was to be called the " unified economic area . "
the germans called it the " bi-zone . "
more than two years later the french zone joined , and the tri-zone was formed . the marshall plan - political divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1947 watercolor portrait of george c. marshall by e.h. baker just five months later , us secretary of state george c. marshall -lrb- photo -rrb- called for american assistance in restoring the economic infrastructure of europe .
western europe responded favorably , and the truman administration proposed the marshall plan legislation . the resulting economic cooperation act of 1948 aimed at restoring european agricultural and industrial productivity .
it was also designed as an anti-communist measure .
western germany received $ 1.5 billion to rebuild coal and steel production , power generation and other industries .
the soviets ordered the eastern european countries , who were also offered economic help , not to accept any .
the turning point in the two halves of germany was reached in 1948 .
in the soviet zone , the government introduced a centralized planned economy as well as a new east german currency .
in the west , new bank notes - the deutsch mark - were also handed out .
the country 's economic divide was complete .
only one year later the political divide followed , with the founding of two , separate german states . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush ruffles russian feathers us president george w. bush heads to europe friday for the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?

germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .

the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.05.2005 coming to terms with vichy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vichy leader henri philippe petain was sentenced to death for treason for years , france preferred to remember those who resisted the nazis , rather than those who collaborated with them .
but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .
only gradually did the french begin waking up to the truth about les annees noires - the dark years of the war .
the 1970s and 1980s saw a series of revelations about france 's wartime history . but it was n't until president jacques chirac took office that france agreed to compensate victims of the holocaust . " it took a very long time before the attitude of the vichy state was actually acknowledged , particularly what was done to the jews during the war , " said parliamentarian herve mariton . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme-right leader jean-marie le pen but even today , there are signs that not everyone accepts what has now become conventional wisdom .
earlier this year , the national front leader jean-marie le pen described the wartime occupation by the germans as " not particularly inhumane " despite " some excesses . "
his comments provoked a furor , but even in a subsequent radio interview , he refused to back down . " they say i 'm too hard on the arabs , " he said .
" now they say i 'm not hard enough on the germans .
in our country people are not free to think .
it 's scandalous that 60 years after the war , there 's no free expression on these subjects . " le pen 's original interview was given to a far-right journal called riverol , which was started up by vichy sympathizers after the war .
for some , his comments suggest traditional revisionist thinking about the wartime era is still alive and well . generational civil war yet last year 's commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the normandy landings and the liberation of paris passed without too much argument .
historian antony beever said that , on the whole , france has learned to separate myth from reality . " rather like in germany , there was almost a civil war between the generations over that history , particularly in the late 1970s , and 1980s , " beever said .

in 1909 the catholic youth group " trinity parish " decided to form the " ballspiel-verein borussia 09 " , very much to the annoyance of local chaplain hubert dewald .
the father tried to prevent the " rebels " from founding the club – in vain .
he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .
in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .
the team finished second in the bundesliga thus qualifying for the uefa cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalenstadion the high aims of president dr. gerd niebaum and other club officials led to the launch of a unique project in german football : the transfer of the stadium ground to the westfalenstadion dortmund gmbh & co .
kg -lrb- public limited society -rrb- .
this act was supposed to enable the officials to act independently ; the stadium was enlarged to about 70,000 standing and seating without any financial support of the city council .
at that time nobody could or would foresee the financial desaster the club would have to face years later .
for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .
charlton conveyed fairness and friendship to both groups and got a positive response .
bvb reached the final of the champions league where they beat juventus turin 3-1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund's christoph metzelder , florian kringe , czech scorer thomas rosicky , czech player jan koller and brazilian player ewerthon , from left , celebrate during the german first division soccer match between borussia dortmund and werder bremen eager to repeat this triumph bvb subsequently effected very expensive transactions culminating in the signing of marcio amoroso from parma in 2001 for the record transfer fee of 25 million euros .
the brasilian was the team ’ s hero for one season but then suffered from various injuries and finally left for málaga on a free transfer .
in the season of 2000 officials called up udo lattek and matthias sammer as coaches to prevent crisis- stricken dortmund from being relegated .
the two coaches managed to keep the club in the league .
however , the next step into financial crisis was to come : on october 31st .
bvb went public .
at first this seemed to be a sensible decision as one month later the club announced record earnings of 184,4 million dm .
in november 2001 , however , the bvb-share had dropped to 5,18 € .
in february 2005 club officials confirmed that the financial situation threatened the club ’ s existence .
as part of the emergency plan the westfalenstadion was sold in order to prevent the bankruptcy .
dortmund fans will never forget the worry they went through in the past months when bankruptcy brought the club to the brink of having to fold .
the lessons will have been learnt for the future . nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.05.2005 nazi past lives on in berlin 's buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport : a prime example of the architecture of the nazi era the nazis left a lasting imprint on the berlin landscape , with ministries , airports and even bunkers in their signature bombastic style .
many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .
only gradually did the french begin waking up to the truth about les annees noires - the dark years of the war .
the 1970s and 1980s saw a series of revelations about france 's wartime history . but it was n't until president jacques chirac took office that france agreed to compensate victims of the holocaust . " it took a very long time before the attitude of the vichy state was actually acknowledged , particularly what was done to the jews during the war , " said parliamentarian herve mariton . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme-right leader jean-marie le pen but even today , there are signs that not everyone accepts what has now become conventional wisdom .
earlier this year , the national front leader jean-marie le pen described the wartime occupation by the germans as " not particularly inhumane " despite " some excesses . "
his comments provoked a furor , but even in a subsequent radio interview , he refused to back down . " they say i 'm too hard on the arabs , " he said .
" now they say i 'm not hard enough on the germans .
in our country people are not free to think .
it 's scandalous that 60 years after the war , there 's no free expression on these subjects . " le pen 's original interview was given to a far-right journal called riverol , which was started up by vichy sympathizers after the war .
for some , his comments suggest traditional revisionist thinking about the wartime era is still alive and well . generational civil war yet last year 's commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the normandy landings and the liberation of paris passed without too much argument .
historian antony beever said that , on the whole , france has learned to separate myth from reality . " rather like in germany , there was almost a civil war between the generations over that history , particularly in the late 1970s , and 1980s , " beever said .
" but germany faced up to its past and i think france has certainly managed to as well .

the father tried to prevent the " rebels " from founding the club – in vain .
he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .
in 1991 the new coach ottmar hitzfeld was to bring back success to dortmund .

for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .
charlton conveyed fairness and friendship to both groups and got a positive response .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.05.2005 nazi past lives on in berlin 's buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport : a prime example of the architecture of the nazi era the nazis left a lasting imprint on the berlin landscape , with ministries , airports and even bunkers in their signature bombastic style .
many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.05.2005 nazi past lives on in berlin 's buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport : a prime example of the architecture of the nazi era the nazis left a lasting imprint on the berlin landscape , with ministries , airports and even bunkers in their signature bombastic style .
many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.05.2005 coming to terms with vichy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vichy leader henri philippe petain was sentenced to death for treason for years , france preferred to remember those who resisted the nazis , rather than those who collaborated with them .
but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .
only gradually did the french begin waking up to the truth about les annees noires - the dark years of the war .
the 1970s and 1980s saw a series of revelations about france 's wartime history . but it was n't until president jacques chirac took office that france agreed to compensate victims of the holocaust . " it took a very long time before the attitude of the vichy state was actually acknowledged , particularly what was done to the jews during the war , " said parliamentarian herve mariton . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme-right leader jean-marie le pen but even today , there are signs that not everyone accepts what has now become conventional wisdom .
earlier this year , the national front leader jean-marie le pen described the wartime occupation by the germans as " not particularly inhumane " despite " some excesses . "
his comments provoked a furor , but even in a subsequent radio interview , he refused to back down . " they say i 'm too hard on the arabs , " he said .
" now they say i 'm not hard enough on the germans .
in our country people are not free to think .
it 's scandalous that 60 years after the war , there 's no free expression on these subjects . " le pen 's original interview was given to a far-right journal called riverol , which was started up by vichy sympathizers after the war .
for some , his comments suggest traditional revisionist thinking about the wartime era is still alive and well . generational civil war yet last year 's commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the normandy landings and the liberation of paris passed without too much argument .
historian antony beever said that , on the whole , france has learned to separate myth from reality . " rather like in germany , there was almost a civil war between the generations over that history , particularly in the late 1970s , and 1980s , " beever said .
" but germany faced up to its past and i think france has certainly managed to as well .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .
only gradually did the french begin waking up to the truth about les annees noires - the dark years of the war .
the 1970s and 1980s saw a series of revelations about france 's wartime history . but it was n't until president jacques chirac took office that france agreed to compensate victims of the holocaust . " it took a very long time before the attitude of the vichy state was actually acknowledged , particularly what was done to the jews during the war , " said parliamentarian herve mariton . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme-right leader jean-marie le pen but even today , there are signs that not everyone accepts what has now become conventional wisdom .
earlier this year , the national front leader jean-marie le pen described the wartime occupation by the germans as " not particularly inhumane " despite " some excesses . "
his comments provoked a furor , but even in a subsequent radio interview , he refused to back down . " they say i 'm too hard on the arabs , " he said .
" now they say i 'm not hard enough on the germans .
in our country people are not free to think .
it 's scandalous that 60 years after the war , there 's no free expression on these subjects . " le pen 's original interview was given to a far-right journal called riverol , which was started up by vichy sympathizers after the war .
for some , his comments suggest traditional revisionist thinking about the wartime era is still alive and well . generational civil war yet last year 's commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the normandy landings and the liberation of paris passed without too much argument .
historian antony beever said that , on the whole , france has learned to separate myth from reality . " rather like in germany , there was almost a civil war between the generations over that history , particularly in the late 1970s , and 1980s , " beever said .
" but germany faced up to its past and i think france has certainly managed to as well .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?

germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?

stars such as former tennis player boris becker and actor bruno ganz , who played hitler in a hit film about the dictator last year , were to address the crowd at the brandenburg gate . on tuesday , a monument to the holocaust , with 2,711 anthracite gray pillars representing the genocide of the jews , will be inaugurated near the brandenburg gate . neo-nazis risked embarrassing berlin event but , the occasion was clouded by a huge gathering of neo-nazis who were planning a march in the german capital and possible counter-actions by extreme leftists . bildunterschrift : npd supporters at berlin 's alexanderplatz on sunday police said around 3,000 protestors from the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- had gathered in the alexanderplatz square in eastern berlin . many had come from countries like sweden and romania .
riot police surrounded the npd demonstrators in a bid to prevent clashes with an estimated 10,000 left-wing protesters who had marched across the city in a counter-protest . in the end , however , the police cancelled the planned march because of the risk of clashes . earlier the npd said it wanted " an end to the cult of guilt " after " 60 years of lies " . on friday , germany 's constitutional court reaffirmed a ban on neo-nazi demonstrations near the holocaust memorial which is to be officially unveiled next week . the npd was instead allowed to march from berlin 's alexanderplatz in the east of the city to a train station a few blocks from the brandenburg gate .
their path would have taken them past a memorial for victims of the war , but only after politicians lay wreaths at the monument . " prepared to fight for democracy " berlin mayor klaus wowereit on saturday urged young people to assemble in a show of democracy against the right-wing extremists .
" we must remain vigilant , " the social-democrat mayor said , calling for the defense of democracy " with democratic means . " there will be " a mixture of commemoration and celebration .
we are prepared , if necessary , to fight for democracy , " wowereit said . interior minister otto schily urged the germans to show proof of " civic courage " in opposing the neo-nazis , and said he found it encouraging that so many young people were rising in opposition to the extremists . one of the leaders of the ruling social democrats , ottmar schreiner , said that all school pupils should obligatorily be made to visit a concentration camp .

dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for the united states today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john a. cloud , who has served as the deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in berlin since july 2003 , became chargé d 'affaires ad interim upon the departure of ambassador daniel r. coats on february 28 , 2005 .
john cloud : the architects of the postwar transatlantic alliance shaped the course of us diplomacy and the entire international system .
the resulting nato and the marshall plan provided military security , economic development and regional reform , and advanced international cooperation .
the united nations also arose out of this experience .
building on this foundation , it is now up to europe and the united states to jointly promote freedom beyond the euro-atlantic area , and help the world face the other new challenged that are arising .
as secretary of state rice said , " this is a moment of incredible possibility for human liberty , greater than at any other time since world war ii . "
what political conclusions does the united states draw from world war ii today ?
do the united states ' experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
one of the lessons the world learned from world war ii was that peaceful nations can not close their eyes or sit idly by in the face of genocide .
it took the most terrible war in history to end the horrors of the holocaust .
we confronted the devastation and the anguish of world war ii with the ideals of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
today the concepts of open political discourse and dialogue are more important than ever before .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in the united states , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
the german-american relationship in the second half of the 20th century was a unique and extraordinary accomplishment .
few nations have the capacity of germany to join with the united states to address the challenges of the 21st century .
with a renewed spirit of purpose , compromise , unity and agreement , our joint commitment to make this world a safer and better place is a very appropriate commemoration of the second world war .
the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry , answered the same questions in relation to his country and british-german relations 60 years after the end of the world war ii .
dw-world : what is the significance of the end of world war ii for britain today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british ambassador to germany , sir peter torry sir peter torry : we remember all those who died between september 1939 and may 1945 .
we pay tribute to the hundreds of thousand of allied soldiers , sailors and airmen who gave their lives so that others might live and so that freedom , peace and democracy could once more flourish and grow in europe .
the suffering and the sacrifices that were needed to rid the world of the nazi dictatorship should never be forgotten .
but at the same time we should be proud of what we have achieved in the past 60 years .
former enemies have become close partners and friends .
the relationship between britain and germany has never been better .
nato and the eu have made war inconceivable and brought prosperity and justice to europe .
germany today has nothing in common with germany of 1945 .
what political conclusions does britain draw from world war ii today ?
do britain 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's foreign policy , and if so , how ?
when the war ended , the overwhelming feeling in britain as well as in germany can be described as " never again . "
the main thrust of our british foreign policy since 1945 has been to avoid the terrible mistakes of the early 20th century and to build genuine stability and security in europe .
that has been the great achievement of the eu and nato .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 brought democracy to eastern europe .
eu and nato enlargement has helped cement this .
we can never be complacent - the civil war in yugoslavia showed us that - but we are near to achieving our historic goal of a europe that is democratic , prosperous and at peace .
our work is not yet over however .
many lessons of the second world war - that dictatorship can not be appeased , that the best protection against war is the expansion of democracy - still apply in many other parts of the world .
the other main conclusion that we draw from wwii is that a strong and close transatlantic relationship is essential .
the us has been essential for european security in the last 60 years .
we must ensure that this relationship remains strong .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence politics in britain , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
i view germany very positively .
germany now is a very different country to the germany of 1945 .
germany and britain are natural partners and we work increasingly closely together .
350,000 british people work for german companies in the uk .
a booming british economy is one of germany 's largest export markets .
the uk is the biggest investor in the euro zone .
the arsenal football team has a german goalkeeper .
a british conductor leads the berlin philharmonic .
thousands of germans and british visit each others ' country every year .
our soldiers stand together in kosovo and afghanistan .
the war is naturally not forgotten in britain .
nor should it be .
but it has no influence on british politics .
some british perceptions of germany are still colored by the war .
how could it be otherwise ?
but i repeat : the relationship today is one of friends and allies : it has never been better . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wwii - 60 years on dw-world 's dossier on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .
olivier todd , who was 15 years old at the time , watched the scenes that were played out on the champs elysees , and said the reality was n't quite so clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statue of former french president charles de gaulle in front of the grand palais in paris " everybody turned out to be gaullists by that time , but as a kid , i 'd seen marshal henri philippe petain - the leader of the vichy regime - be acclaimed by parisians on the champs elysees , and only a few weeks later i saw de gaulle be acclaimed , " todd said .
" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .
the reality was that only a small minority had actively fought the nazis .
the vast majority of the police in paris worked for the germans . the embellished story of the french resistance was a deliberate policy , thought out against a background of serious divisions between gaullists and communists , according to antony beever , the author of several books about world war ii including " paris after the liberation . " " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .
only gradually did the french begin waking up to the truth about les annees noires - the dark years of the war .
the 1970s and 1980s saw a series of revelations about france 's wartime history . but it was n't until president jacques chirac took office that france agreed to compensate victims of the holocaust . " it took a very long time before the attitude of the vichy state was actually acknowledged , particularly what was done to the jews during the war , " said parliamentarian herve mariton . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme-right leader jean-marie le pen but even today , there are signs that not everyone accepts what has now become conventional wisdom .
earlier this year , the national front leader jean-marie le pen described the wartime occupation by the germans as " not particularly inhumane " despite " some excesses . "
his comments provoked a furor , but even in a subsequent radio interview , he refused to back down . " they say i 'm too hard on the arabs , " he said .
" now they say i 'm not hard enough on the germans .
in our country people are not free to think .
it 's scandalous that 60 years after the war , there 's no free expression on these subjects . " le pen 's original interview was given to a far-right journal called riverol , which was started up by vichy sympathizers after the war .
for some , his comments suggest traditional revisionist thinking about the wartime era is still alive and well . generational civil war yet last year 's commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the normandy landings and the liberation of paris passed without too much argument .
historian antony beever said that , on the whole , france has learned to separate myth from reality . " rather like in germany , there was almost a civil war between the generations over that history , particularly in the late 1970s , and 1980s , " beever said .

but gradually the story of the vichy regime 's betrayal of the jewish community has emerged . after france fell to germany in 1940 , a government continued to operate from vichy in an unoccupied zone in southern france .
the regime passed anti-semitic laws and helped to deport more than 75,000 jews .
only a small minority survived the concentration camps .
in the paris region 13,000 jews were rounded up in one night alone , in what became known as the vel d 'hiv round-up , named after the cycling stadium where most of them were subsequently imprisoned . these were not the events which were highlighted after general charles de gaulle 's triumphant entry into a liberated paris in 1944 . instead , his famous words stressed the heroic role of the french in resisting the nazis .

" we were versatile . " reassuring myth after the war , de gaulle repeated his message - something historians have come to see as a reassuring myth of national resistance .

" " de gaulle needed to project an image of france which almost everyone could sign up to , " beever said .
" it was very cleverly done - but it was not entirely cynical because de gaulle , like many military leaders , had this sort of ideal version of what post-war france would be .
however , it was an ideal which did n't exactly work out in reality . " during de gaulle 's years in power , the french republic sought to play down past divisions in an effort to make a clean break with the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.05.2005 nazi past lives on in berlin 's buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport : a prime example of the architecture of the nazi era the nazis left a lasting imprint on the berlin landscape , with ministries , airports and even bunkers in their signature bombastic style .
many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .

many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .

plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials .

he and his faithful followers were physically blocked when trying to enter the restaurant where the foundation took place .
after this turbulent start bvb focused on sports and have become one of the most succesful teams in germany .
in 1947 bvb won the westphalia championship final 3-2 over schalke 04 .
schalke – the other big traditional club of the ruhr valley – have always been dortmund ’ s arch rivals .
this triumph was the introduction to two very succesful decades for the club .
in the 1950 ’ s dortmund strenghtened their position in german football with two successive german titles in 1956 and 1957 .
one year later bvb had their first international appearance taking part in the european cup winners cup .
in 1963 bvb were the last team to win the german championship before the start of the bundesliga format .
the first big international success for the club was the 2-1 victory over liverpool in the european cup winners cup final in glasgow in 1966 .
the squad , to achieve this historic victory , was loaded with high quality footballers such as lothar emmerich , siegfried held , wolfgang paul and rudi assauer , today ’ s manager of schalke 04 .
in the following seasons bvb could not repeat the success and were even relegated to the second division .
they managed to come back in 1972 but during this decade two other teams dominated german football : borussia mönchengladbach and bayern münchen .

for the time being officials seemed to follow the right track ; the club won the german title in 1995 and 1996 .
however , the most succesful season was yet to come .
in 1997 bvb played a terrific champions league season and also managed to gain attention off from the pitch .
on the occasion of the champions league semi-final between bvb and manchester united the club arranged a fan meeting with over 6,000 bvb and manu supporters in the old market place in the city of dortmund .
the event lasted until the evening hours because the big match in the westfalenstadion was broadcasted on a large video screen .
the afternoon appearance of legendary english footballer sir bobby charlton was the highlight of the fan meeting .

bvb went public .
at first this seemed to be a sensible decision as one month later the club announced record earnings of 184,4 million dm .
in november 2001 , however , the bvb-share had dropped to 5,18 € .
in february 2005 club officials confirmed that the financial situation threatened the club ’ s existence .

at a cemetery at the southern dutch town of margraten , where over 8,000 us soldiers lie buried , bush and queen beatrix of the netherlands laid a wreath , gunshots rang out in salute and a bugler played the last post . military planes flew overhead in a " missing man " formation , where one plane breaks away from the group to signify a fallen comrade . " we recommend ourselves to the great truth that they defended , that freedom is the birthright of all mankind , " bush said in tribute .
even today , the president said , " americans and europeans are continuing to work together and bringing freedom to places where it has long been denied : in afghanistan , in iraq , in lebanon and across the broader middle east . " " the world 's tyrants learned a lesson , " he added . " there is no power like the power of freedom , and no soldier as strong as a soldier who fights for this freedom .

he was due later to take the salute at a parade of veterans . in paris , president jacques chirac laid flowers on the tomb of the unknown soldier under the arc de triomphe and bestowed medals on several deportees . fighter jets closed the commemoration with a fly-past , trailing blue , white and red smoke behind them . uncomfortable reminders too but there were reminders too , notably in poland and the baltic states , that the fall of nazi germany also ushered in 50 years of totalitarian soviet rule over eastern europe . czech president vaclav klaus and prime minister jiri paroubek led tributes in prague to the victims of the war and tens of thousands of people watched a drive-by of vintage military vehicles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war ii veterans salute wartime army flags during ceremonies marking 60 years since the war 's end in wroclaw , poland on saturday , may 7 , 2005 .
polish president aleksander kwasniewski hailed the sacrifices of the soviet red army , but also called for recognition of soviet crimes under stalin . poland was carved up by hitler and stalin under a pact shortly before wwii broke out , and after the war was dragooned into subservience to moscow . " we can not today allow historical reality to be manipulated once again .
we will not change history , but we can overcome its legacy , " he said at poland 's main official ceremony in the southwest city of wroclaw . kwasniewski has been criticized in poland for planning to attend the climax of the europe-wide celebrations monday in moscow , when up to 60 world leaders including bush are to watch a military parade in red square . estonian prime minister andrus ansip called in tallinn for reconciliation , noting that while his nation was invaded during the war and ruled from moscow afterward , atrocities were also committed on its territory against jews . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president : we will never forget germany is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the nazi surrender in wwii sunday with celebrations of its hard-won democracy , but the day threatens to be overshadowed by a major neo-nazi protest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.05.2005 nazi past lives on in berlin 's buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof airport : a prime example of the architecture of the nazi era the nazis left a lasting imprint on the berlin landscape , with ministries , airports and even bunkers in their signature bombastic style .
many of the buildings are still in use today . adolf hitler wanted to make berlin the capital of the world under a master plan drawn up by the nazi regime 's architect , albert speer , which was due to be completed in the 1950s . in the center of this metropolis organized around a north-south axis and an east-west axis , was to have been a circular domed hall 320 meters -lrb- 1,050 feet -rrb- high , lined with columns in the style of ancient rome .
the building , intended to be a temple to the cult of hitler , would have been big enough to contain 180,000 people .
with world war ii lost , the idea for the dome died along with hitler in 1945 . but in 1936 , a number of giant structures erected by the nazi regime were unveiled , and they continue to play an integral role in berlin city life today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium in 1936 the metal and glass zoologischer garten rail station remains a key transport hub and the imposing olympic stadium , built for the 1936 summer olympics , in which black american sprinter jesse owens won four gold medals and made a mockery of hitler 's desire for an aryan " master race , " will host the 2006 world cup football final . also unveiled in 1936 was the waldbühne open-air arena , which still welcomes the biggest rock and pop acts to the german capital . still government buildings the aviation ministry , the first government building built by the nazis , opened that year too .
a series of austere blocks housing 2,000 rooms with identical small windows , it miraculously escaped the intense bombing of the final months of the war in 1945 .
four years later , the building was the venue for the signing of the constitution underpinning the communist german democratic republic and now , in reunited germany , it is the home of the finance ministry . further to the east of berlin lies the nazis ' reichsbank where the valuables seized from jews were stored .
after the postwar division of germany it became the headquarters of the central committee of east germany 's communist party and today hosts the foreign ministry , although some of the german state 's gold reserves are still kept in safes there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian embassy was originally built by german architect friedrich hetzelt in 1938 and was rebuilt by italian architect vittorio de feo .
the broken columns are damaged remains from world war ii and were left sitting on the ground as part of the architectural concept .
the list of buildings constructed under the nazi regime which are still used for their original purpose is also lengthy : tempelhof airport and the embassies of japan and italy -lrb- photo -rrb- , to name but a few . and the " grosser stern " square in the center of the tiergarten park was enlarged in 1938 and the column commemorating germany 's victory over france in 1871 was moved from the grounds of the reichstag parliament building .
it still towers over the park today . hitler 's bunker has been sealed one building the german authorities want no one to see is the bunker where hitler committed suicide on april 30 , 1945 .
today the site , a few hundred yards from the gleaming cinema , retail and office complex on potsdamer platz , is hidden and there is pointedly no plaque to mark the spot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site of hitler 's bunker in berlin also built in 1936 , near the old chancellery , the bunker comprised 30 small rooms which were so small " you could hardly fit in a chair for a visitor , " as rochus misch , one of the ss guards in the bunker , recalled .
plans to open the site to the public never got off the ground , possibly because of fears it would become a shrine for neo-nazis .
once the berlin wall fell in 1990 , the adjacent bunker of accommodation for hitler 's drivers was unearthed under the former no-man 's land around the wall .
it also has been sealed . dietmar arnold , a historian for the " berlin underworld " group which organizes visits of underground attractions in berlin , said the bunkers should be opened up as memorials . " there is no place in germany where the spirit -lrb- of the nazis and their crimes -rrb- is better preserved , " arnold said . silent witnesses of terror while hitler and his top commanders ensured they were protected from bombing , the program of building bunkers for civilians only started in 1940 .
however , just one year later it was decided to only build bunkers above ground because it was cheaper .
more than 1,000 were built and the remains of around 350 can still be seen dotted around the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formerly the site of a techno club one of the last intact surface bunkers was used to store fruit and vegetables after world war ii .
nicknamed the " banana bunker , " its cavernous interior later served as a techno music club and an exhibition space . meanwhile , while the bunkers are sealed , the remains of the arguably more sinister headquarters of the gestapo , the nazis ' secret police , are on full display to the public , with chilling photographs recalling hitler 's reign of terror . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the architect who flirted with fascism philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer .

disagreements between the soviets and the british and americans foreshadowed the divide to come . at the end of wwii , germany was a wasteland .
its crown cities were bombed to the ground ; its factories and infrastructure in ruins ; its populace scrounging for food and living in shacks .
but if they expected any sympathy from the victorious allies , they were badly mistaken .
" germany is in debt to all those nations whose industries it plundered during the war , " sir brian robertson , the deputy british military governor , said in a radio address at the time . the conquering allies - russia , great britain and the united states - began to dismantle german companies in an effort to bring the country 's industry back to the level it was at in 1932 .
a total of 1,800 factories were packaged and taken away , all in the name of reparations . but a conflict soon arose between the three powers .
whereas great britain and the us wanted germany to begin sustaining itself , stalin was adamant about making the germans pay for the war they started . the birth of planned economies in the east at the same time , the soviets began recruiting german political supporters for their plans for a planned economy .
in berlin 's communist-controlled municipal assembly socialist josef orlopp called for the nationalization of large companies - an idea strongly supported by the soviets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin at the time of capitulation .
the city would soon illustrate the diverging opinions the russians and americans and british had on german economic recovery " the bill at hand … aims at placing common interests and the people 's political will over entrepreneurs ' private capitalist power , " orlopp said . the allied powers had agreed to treat germany as an economic entity at the war conference in potsdam .
but russian moves soon indicated different intentions . though the allied powers had agreed to treat germany as an economic entity at the war conference in potsdam , the soviets had their own plans . beginning in the summer of 1945 , the soviets began expropriating the owners of large estates .
their land was redistributed to small-scale farmers and refugees who at a later stage gave in to government pressure to form large collective farms .
industrial companies were nationalized . dismantlement and reparations led to a rapid decline of the economy in the soviet occupied zone germany allowed to help itself the americans and the british followed this development with suspicion , as they did the control the soviet union had begun to exert over central and eastern europe .
in an attempt to stop communism from expanding the us then made a 180 degree turn on their approach to postwar germany . in a historic speech , us secretary of state james f. byrnes on sept .
6 , 1946 encouraged germany to help itself back on its feet .
" the american people want to return the government of germany and the people of germany to win their way back to an honorable state among the free and peace-loving people of the world , " byrnes said .
the first step on this path was the reconstruction of the german economy .
in this context the american occupying force made the other allies an offer to participate in unified economic zones in germany . by jan .
1 , 1947 the british and the americans had merged their occupying zones to what was to be called the " unified economic area . "
the germans called it the " bi-zone . "
more than two years later the french zone joined , and the tri-zone was formed . the marshall plan - political divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1947 watercolor portrait of george c. marshall by e.h. baker just five months later , us secretary of state george c. marshall -lrb- photo -rrb- called for american assistance in restoring the economic infrastructure of europe .
western europe responded favorably , and the truman administration proposed the marshall plan legislation . the resulting economic cooperation act of 1948 aimed at restoring european agricultural and industrial productivity .
it was also designed as an anti-communist measure .
western germany received $ 1.5 billion to rebuild coal and steel production , power generation and other industries .
the soviets ordered the eastern european countries , who were also offered economic help , not to accept any .
the turning point in the two halves of germany was reached in 1948 .
in the soviet zone , the government introduced a centralized planned economy as well as a new east german currency .
in the west , new bank notes - the deutsch mark - were also handed out .
the country 's economic divide was complete .
only one year later the political divide followed , with the founding of two , separate german states . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bush ruffles russian feathers us president george w. bush heads to europe friday for the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii .
