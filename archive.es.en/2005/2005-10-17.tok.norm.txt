so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest . if social democrat peer steinbrück had planned to ease quietly into his new role as germany 's finance minister , he missed the chance . surely , it will not be easy to take over the " poisoned chalice " cabinet appointment , given the ongoing struggle to plug gaping holes in the german budget .
but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .
incumbent economy minister wolfgang clement had already proposed such a move two years ago , and it was rejected at the time , the spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical scene on germany 's famed highways but a sale of the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,500 mile -rrb- autobahn network could help alleviate germany 's dire budget shortfall .
according to bild am sonntag , a three-year-old report commissioned in connection with the truck toll system said the german autobahn would fetch around 127 billion euros -lrb- $ 153 billion -rrb- . international investment firms goldman sachs and barclays have already begun jockeying for position with the finance and transport ministries for a role in any potential sale .
such a sale could reduce german debt by 890 billion euros , or 15 percent , in one go . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers mull car toll the transportation ministers of germany 's states will discuss a controversial plan to introduce a car toll on the country 's highways on wednesday .

last season , they were seventh . the team 's management is young and has watched the team make an abrupt turnaround with the hiring of coach thomas doll last autumn .
riding a 19-game streak since last season without a defeat , hamburg have been named as the strongest challengers to bayern in the 2005-06 season .

" hsv has improved its marketing profile and strategic decisions are bearing fruit , " said jens krüger , sponsoring director at tns sport . the eternal bridesmaid : schalke coming second in the survey were the royal blues from schalke .

but now , with scandals and financial troubles at home and bloated management in china , the company is struggling in the face of increasing competition .
half-year sales slowed at its two mainland joint ventures to a disappointing 265,000 vehicles after 306,000 for the first half of 2004 .
volkswagen is expected to report disappointing results this year due to eroding margins caused by high material costs , increased competition and a continuing price war .
nevertheless the company said it was committed to introducing 10 to 12 new models before 2009 to the china market , the world 's third largest , that would better cater to local needs .
volkswagen china spokesman kai gruber said the company would seek to reduce production costs by 40 percent over the three-year program .
a stronger focus on in-house developments within its china joint ventures and the addition the skoda brand will be added on to the shanghai volkswagen line starting from 2007 . dw-world.de vw to lose top spot on chinese market us auto giant general motors is snapping at the heels of the german car manufacturer volkswagen , which is likely to lose its position as top dog on the chinese market next year , analysts and industry consultants say .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .

the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .

the eu executive 's spokesman also said it was sending , at the request of turkey , some 700 protective suits for people working in the affected area in the northwest of the country . eu veterinary experts have already approved a package of measures to bolster europe 's defenses against the virus , notably by ensuring that poultry do not come into contact with wild migratory birds which can carry it . for the moment the eu says the measures it has already taken are enough to keep the lethal bird flu strain at bay .

the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .

edmund stoiber had previously confirmed that he would become head of the economics ministry . the new interior minister wolfgang schäuble is a familiar face .
a confidant of conservative former chancellor helmut kohl , he is returning to the job he occupied from 1989 to 1991 , to add some much-needed experience to the cabinet . appointing only a part of the cabinet was the price merkel paid for evicting gerhard schröder from the chancellery after seven years in a power-sharing deal which hands his social democrats eight of the 14 cabinet posts , including the key finance and foreign ministries . a bavarian in berlin merkel made her announcement shortly before the hard bargaining begins to hammer out a program for the new government , in the first acid test for an alliance of political enemies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu leader edmund stoiber and german chancellor-to-be angela merkel even before merkel faces the difficulties posed by managing the social democrat ministers , she has clashed with stoiber , who leads the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . merkel fought against stoiber 's wish to bring his trusted ally horst seehofer into the government because seehofer has been a fierce critic of the conservatives ' proposals to reform the health system . csu party leadership , however , voted unanimously for seehofer 's appointment as agriculture minister , sources close to the csu said on monday morning . clashes or camaraderie ? merkel has dismissed fears that her administration will get bogged down in inter-party squabbles . " i see a spirit of camaraderie in this new government , " she told monday 's issue of der spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right , will play no role in the government schröder will play no role in the new administration , yet many observers saw his influence in the line-up of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- ministers named last week . they included schröder 's former right-hand man , frank-walter steinmeier , as foreign minister , and peer steinbrück , the former premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , as finance minister . spd party leader franz müntefering , another schröder ally -lrb- photo -rrb- , will be vice-chancellor . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a government program may take as long as four weeks the negotiations on the government 's program could take four weeks and the cabinet may not be sworn in until mid-november . there are signs merkel has agreed to water down her more radical proposals to boost the economy , such as cutting employers ' costs .
with the social democrats watching her every move , she is expected to be forced into constant compromise . the conservatives have identified four issues that must be agreed on in the negotiations - a new budget , reviving the labor market and the welfare system and introducing tax reforms to promote economic growth . the first so-called grand coalition government in germany since the 1960s will take office with a mandate to cut an unemployment rate which is currently stuck above 11 percent .

volkswagen china spokesman kai gruber said the company would seek to reduce production costs by 40 percent over the three-year program .

prestige and success pay off and companies want to be associated with the sports teams that can consistently bring home the championship , win the country 's cup , and even occasionally rise to the top and beat the best teams in europe . bayern munich do this on a consistent basis and receive the spoils for their hard work .
now a study by the frankfurt-based horizont sport business publishing house show that in extremely clear terms - nobody does it better in german soccer than the bavarians .
they asked 13 experts in the fields of sports marketing , media , sponsoring and sports agents to take a close look at the 18 bundesliga clubs and pass judgment on each side 's market value . bayern winner in seven categories the jury members were asked to judge in categories such as sporting rights , marketing , brand value , media appearance and sponsoring .
the name at the top in seven categories of eight categories was bayern munich .
the only category that the bundesliga 's strongest club had to play second-fiddle in was that of location which went to the hertha berlin . nevertheless , the jurors do n't think that bayern 's management are taking advantage of their position optimally . thomas röttgermann , president of the sports marketing agency sportfive recognized an " unsatisfactory position on the european market " for germany 's most successful soccer club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's michael ballack -lrb- l -rrb- and friends are worth their weight in gold for the club , the marketing giant in the bundesliga it is obvious that the remaining 17 bundesliga clubs must play catch up with their south german rivals , something that hamburg sv clearly managed to do in the past year , making a clear move towards the top and landing on the third spot in the rankings .
last season , they were seventh . the team 's management is young and has watched the team make an abrupt turnaround with the hiring of coach thomas doll last autumn .
riding a 19-game streak since last season without a defeat , hamburg have been named as the strongest challengers to bayern in the 2005-06 season .
the jurors judged the " consistent work in management and image of the brand name " as particularly noteworthy . " hsv has improved its marketing profile and strategic decisions are bearing fruit , " said jens krüger , sponsoring director at tns sport . the eternal bridesmaid : schalke coming second in the survey were the royal blues from schalke .
the team from the ruhr valley , whose explicit goal it has been for years to finally win a bundesliga title , wants to shed the image of the eternal bridesmaid .
club manager rudi assauer , who has never been one to mince words with bayern 's management , still believes that championship will come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : club manager rudi assauer -lrb- r -rrb- and his pride and joy , the arena aufschalke his work since taking over in 1993 has hardly been topped anywhere else .
according to a poll that the cigar-smoking manager had read , schalke is the most-beloved team in germany - outside of bavaria naturally . " the title that was stolen from us -lrb- in 2001 when bayern scored a goal in injury time to beat hamburg -rrb- gave us a huge push to the top , " assauer told sport-bild magazine .
" all those who were just a little neutral , became schalke fans . " surprising promoted sides the consistent relegations and promotions of fc cologne in the past decade have hardly taken away from the club 's appeal .
they came in seventh in the rankings .
hometown german international striker lukas podolski catapulted the team back into the top division and he has a magnetic attraction that brings fans to the rhein energie stadium .
the former all-purpose facility , the former müngersdorfer stadium , underwent a total makeover that transformed it into a pure soccer stadium and is one of the top locations to watch german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski : he is on the rise as well as fc cologne 's marketability another club that just returned to the first league , eintracht frankfurt , came in 10th .
the central german club has never won a bundesliga title , and its sole german championship came in 1959 , nevertheless feels that it has a proud history of achievements that deserves to put on display like bayern munich 's . after the 2006 world cup , it intends to open a club museum at the team 's stadium .
visitors will be able to view frankfurt 's 1980 uefa cup trophy or its four german cup successes .
quite possibly the item that will literally stick out the most will be 1936 olympic champion tilly fleischer 's spear .
she won that as a member in the club 's track and field department . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem .

but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .
incumbent economy minister wolfgang clement had already proposed such a move two years ago , and it was rejected at the time , the spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical scene on germany 's famed highways but a sale of the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,500 mile -rrb- autobahn network could help alleviate germany 's dire budget shortfall .
according to bild am sonntag , a three-year-old report commissioned in connection with the truck toll system said the german autobahn would fetch around 127 billion euros -lrb- $ 153 billion -rrb- . international investment firms goldman sachs and barclays have already begun jockeying for position with the finance and transport ministries for a role in any potential sale .
such a sale could reduce german debt by 890 billion euros , or 15 percent , in one go . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers mull car toll the transportation ministers of germany 's states will discuss a controversial plan to introduce a car toll on the country 's highways on wednesday .

volkswagen china president and chief executive winfried vahland said a key to this would be differentiation in the positioning of its two joint venture products .
volkswagen , which 20 years ago was the first western auto manufacturer to come into china , was rewarded for its vision with years of near monopoly of the government and taxi vehicle market .
but now , with scandals and financial troubles at home and bloated management in china , the company is struggling in the face of increasing competition .
half-year sales slowed at its two mainland joint ventures to a disappointing 265,000 vehicles after 306,000 for the first half of 2004 .
volkswagen is expected to report disappointing results this year due to eroding margins caused by high material costs , increased competition and a continuing price war .
nevertheless the company said it was committed to introducing 10 to 12 new models before 2009 to the china market , the world 's third largest , that would better cater to local needs .
volkswagen china spokesman kai gruber said the company would seek to reduce production costs by 40 percent over the three-year program .
a stronger focus on in-house developments within its china joint ventures and the addition the skoda brand will be added on to the shanghai volkswagen line starting from 2007 . dw-world.de vw to lose top spot on chinese market us auto giant general motors is snapping at the heels of the german car manufacturer volkswagen , which is likely to lose its position as top dog on the chinese market next year , analysts and industry consultants say .

" i see a spirit of camaraderie in this new government , " she told monday 's issue of der spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right , will play no role in the government schröder will play no role in the new administration , yet many observers saw his influence in the line-up of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- ministers named last week . they included schröder 's former right-hand man , frank-walter steinmeier , as foreign minister , and peer steinbrück , the former premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , as finance minister . spd party leader franz müntefering , another schröder ally -lrb- photo -rrb- , will be vice-chancellor . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a government program may take as long as four weeks the negotiations on the government 's program could take four weeks and the cabinet may not be sworn in until mid-november . there are signs merkel has agreed to water down her more radical proposals to boost the economy , such as cutting employers ' costs .
with the social democrats watching her every move , she is expected to be forced into constant compromise . the conservatives have identified four issues that must be agreed on in the negotiations - a new budget , reviving the labor market and the welfare system and introducing tax reforms to promote economic growth . the first so-called grand coalition government in germany since the 1960s will take office with a mandate to cut an unemployment rate which is currently stuck above 11 percent .

"
world war ii began when nazi germany invaded poland on september 1 , 1939 . the allegations caused a storm but were firmly denied by tusk , a member of an ethnic kashubian group inhabiting poland 's north . tusk said the dredging up of the past " overstepped the bounds of decency . " during hitler 's occupation many kashubians , who for centuries nurtured german and polish influence , were forcibly enlisted into the german army . " blows below the belt " tusk has now called for a public apology . " all those who raise a hand to smite the dead are not worthy of respect or power , " tusk told reporters .
although his feelings had been badly hurt , he did not intend to return such " blows below the belt . " but he did add that someone who " could n't control his own staff " should not be president of poland . polish tv reported that documents in berlin archives show that tusk 's grandfather joseph did indeed serve in the wehrmacht for a few months at the end of the war before joining the polish army that fought germans with allied troops .
tusk and others countered that many poles were forced to join the german army . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voting station , which is decorated like a cave , near poznan kaczynski sought to distance himself from the accusations attributed by the weekly to his campaign manager and fired him before apologizing to tusk . " i am not responsible for this type of campaigning , and i will pay the consequences of what was said , " he told reporters . tusk said both his grandfathers had fought in the polish resistance during the war , and had spent part of the conflict in german concentration camps on polish soil . tusk front runner last week , kaczynski finished a close second to tusk in the first round of the presidential election with 36 percent of the vote followed by kaczynski with 33 percent .
the run-off is set for october 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk is the front runner for the presidency a poll published saturday showed that tusk , a free-market liberal , has built significantly on his lead over kaczynski since the first round , and would reap 44 percent of the vote in the run-off , due to be held on october 23 , against 39 percent for his conservative rival . as tusk and kaczynski fight it out for the presidency , their parties are in talks to form a coalition to govern poland .
kaczynski 's conservative and populist roman catholic pis finished first in legislative elections held last month , with tusk 's pro-market civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- just a few points behind . sensitive issue pis has previously resorted to nationalist rhetoric during the campaigns for the legislature and presidency , playing on lingering polish fears of germany and russia . any hints of collaboration with nazi germany are highly damaging in poland .

so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest . if social democrat peer steinbrück had planned to ease quietly into his new role as germany 's finance minister , he missed the chance . surely , it will not be easy to take over the " poisoned chalice " cabinet appointment , given the ongoing struggle to plug gaping holes in the german budget .
but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .

a confidant of conservative former chancellor helmut kohl , he is returning to the job he occupied from 1989 to 1991 , to add some much-needed experience to the cabinet . appointing only a part of the cabinet was the price merkel paid for evicting gerhard schröder from the chancellery after seven years in a power-sharing deal which hands his social democrats eight of the 14 cabinet posts , including the key finance and foreign ministries . a bavarian in berlin merkel made her announcement shortly before the hard bargaining begins to hammer out a program for the new government , in the first acid test for an alliance of political enemies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu leader edmund stoiber and german chancellor-to-be angela merkel even before merkel faces the difficulties posed by managing the social democrat ministers , she has clashed with stoiber , who leads the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . merkel fought against stoiber 's wish to bring his trusted ally horst seehofer into the government because seehofer has been a fierce critic of the conservatives ' proposals to reform the health system . csu party leadership , however , voted unanimously for seehofer 's appointment as agriculture minister , sources close to the csu said on monday morning . clashes or camaraderie ? merkel has dismissed fears that her administration will get bogged down in inter-party squabbles . " i see a spirit of camaraderie in this new government , " she told monday 's issue of der spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right , will play no role in the government schröder will play no role in the new administration , yet many observers saw his influence in the line-up of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- ministers named last week . they included schröder 's former right-hand man , frank-walter steinmeier , as foreign minister , and peer steinbrück , the former premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , as finance minister . spd party leader franz müntefering , another schröder ally -lrb- photo -rrb- , will be vice-chancellor . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a government program may take as long as four weeks the negotiations on the government 's program could take four weeks and the cabinet may not be sworn in until mid-november . there are signs merkel has agreed to water down her more radical proposals to boost the economy , such as cutting employers ' costs .
with the social democrats watching her every move , she is expected to be forced into constant compromise . the conservatives have identified four issues that must be agreed on in the negotiations - a new budget , reviving the labor market and the welfare system and introducing tax reforms to promote economic growth . the first so-called grand coalition government in germany since the 1960s will take office with a mandate to cut an unemployment rate which is currently stuck above 11 percent .
the economy is hardly growing and faces intense competition from low-cost eastern european neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks strong allies for cabinet germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel huddled with party leaders on friday seeking big-hitting conservative ministers able to hold their own against coalition partners loyal to gerhard schröder .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .
he calls on all member states to build up stocks , " said tod , while refusing to say how many or which countries have shortfalls . scientists confirmed on saturday that romania has the lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu - which has killed over 60 people in asia - two days after the killer virus was determined to be present in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 - in gold - in detail .
the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .
on monday a group of flu experts called on the eu to fund development of prototype drugs against bird flu itself - but warned that such research could cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- . " eu should pay for development and clinical trials carried out by industry , because ... there is no market for a prototype , " said professor albert osterhaus of the european scientific working group of influenza , which groups centers such as france 's institut pasteur and germany 's robert koch institute . eu experts in ' hot zones ' of turkey , romania the eu commission meanwhile confirmed that eu experts sent to turkey and bulgaria were already working on the ground , in liaison with authorities from those countries .
eu experts were already dispatched to romania last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts are on the ground in turkey and romania .
the eu executive 's spokesman also said it was sending , at the request of turkey , some 700 protective suits for people working in the affected area in the northwest of the country . eu veterinary experts have already approved a package of measures to bolster europe 's defenses against the virus , notably by ensuring that poultry do not come into contact with wild migratory birds which can carry it . for the moment the eu says the measures it has already taken are enough to keep the lethal bird flu strain at bay .
but " if the situation evolves and further measures are required the commission will immediately react , " said the spokesman , declining to speculate on what such measures could be . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

"
world war ii began when nazi germany invaded poland on september 1 , 1939 . the allegations caused a storm but were firmly denied by tusk , a member of an ethnic kashubian group inhabiting poland 's north . tusk said the dredging up of the past " overstepped the bounds of decency . " during hitler 's occupation many kashubians , who for centuries nurtured german and polish influence , were forcibly enlisted into the german army . " blows below the belt " tusk has now called for a public apology . " all those who raise a hand to smite the dead are not worthy of respect or power , " tusk told reporters .
although his feelings had been badly hurt , he did not intend to return such " blows below the belt . " but he did add that someone who " could n't control his own staff " should not be president of poland . polish tv reported that documents in berlin archives show that tusk 's grandfather joseph did indeed serve in the wehrmacht for a few months at the end of the war before joining the polish army that fought germans with allied troops .
tusk and others countered that many poles were forced to join the german army . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voting station , which is decorated like a cave , near poznan kaczynski sought to distance himself from the accusations attributed by the weekly to his campaign manager and fired him before apologizing to tusk . " i am not responsible for this type of campaigning , and i will pay the consequences of what was said , " he told reporters . tusk said both his grandfathers had fought in the polish resistance during the war , and had spent part of the conflict in german concentration camps on polish soil . tusk front runner last week , kaczynski finished a close second to tusk in the first round of the presidential election with 36 percent of the vote followed by kaczynski with 33 percent .

so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest . if social democrat peer steinbrück had planned to ease quietly into his new role as germany 's finance minister , he missed the chance . surely , it will not be easy to take over the " poisoned chalice " cabinet appointment , given the ongoing struggle to plug gaping holes in the german budget .
but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .
incumbent economy minister wolfgang clement had already proposed such a move two years ago , and it was rejected at the time , the spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical scene on germany 's famed highways but a sale of the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,500 mile -rrb- autobahn network could help alleviate germany 's dire budget shortfall .
according to bild am sonntag , a three-year-old report commissioned in connection with the truck toll system said the german autobahn would fetch around 127 billion euros -lrb- $ 153 billion -rrb- . international investment firms goldman sachs and barclays have already begun jockeying for position with the finance and transport ministries for a role in any potential sale .
such a sale could reduce german debt by 890 billion euros , or 15 percent , in one go . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers mull car toll the transportation ministers of germany 's states will discuss a controversial plan to introduce a car toll on the country 's highways on wednesday .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .
he calls on all member states to build up stocks , " said tod , while refusing to say how many or which countries have shortfalls . scientists confirmed on saturday that romania has the lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu - which has killed over 60 people in asia - two days after the killer virus was determined to be present in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 - in gold - in detail .
the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .
on monday a group of flu experts called on the eu to fund development of prototype drugs against bird flu itself - but warned that such research could cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- . " eu should pay for development and clinical trials carried out by industry , because ... there is no market for a prototype , " said professor albert osterhaus of the european scientific working group of influenza , which groups centers such as france 's institut pasteur and germany 's robert koch institute . eu experts in ' hot zones ' of turkey , romania the eu commission meanwhile confirmed that eu experts sent to turkey and bulgaria were already working on the ground , in liaison with authorities from those countries .
eu experts were already dispatched to romania last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts are on the ground in turkey and romania .
the eu executive 's spokesman also said it was sending , at the request of turkey , some 700 protective suits for people working in the affected area in the northwest of the country . eu veterinary experts have already approved a package of measures to bolster europe 's defenses against the virus , notably by ensuring that poultry do not come into contact with wild migratory birds which can carry it . for the moment the eu says the measures it has already taken are enough to keep the lethal bird flu strain at bay .
but " if the situation evolves and further measures are required the commission will immediately react , " said the spokesman , declining to speculate on what such measures could be . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .

the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .
on monday a group of flu experts called on the eu to fund development of prototype drugs against bird flu itself - but warned that such research could cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- . " eu should pay for development and clinical trials carried out by industry , because ... there is no market for a prototype , " said professor albert osterhaus of the european scientific working group of influenza , which groups centers such as france 's institut pasteur and germany 's robert koch institute . eu experts in ' hot zones ' of turkey , romania the eu commission meanwhile confirmed that eu experts sent to turkey and bulgaria were already working on the ground , in liaison with authorities from those countries .
eu experts were already dispatched to romania last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts are on the ground in turkey and romania .
the eu executive 's spokesman also said it was sending , at the request of turkey , some 700 protective suits for people working in the affected area in the northwest of the country . eu veterinary experts have already approved a package of measures to bolster europe 's defenses against the virus , notably by ensuring that poultry do not come into contact with wild migratory birds which can carry it . for the moment the eu says the measures it has already taken are enough to keep the lethal bird flu strain at bay .
but " if the situation evolves and further measures are required the commission will immediately react , " said the spokesman , declining to speculate on what such measures could be . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

it is clear that bayern munich are the tops in the bundesliga both on and off the field .
yet who is behind them trying to get a piece of the big marketing pie in the league reveals a few surprises . bayern munich have the league cornered .
the club led by coach felix magath sit atop the league after eight match days but the competition is hot on their heels - hamburg , bremen and schalke look to dethrone the champions . where the " dwarves " - this would naturally be taken with great offense by fans - will have more difficulties is the marketing area .
prestige and success pay off and companies want to be associated with the sports teams that can consistently bring home the championship , win the country 's cup , and even occasionally rise to the top and beat the best teams in europe . bayern munich do this on a consistent basis and receive the spoils for their hard work .
now a study by the frankfurt-based horizont sport business publishing house show that in extremely clear terms - nobody does it better in german soccer than the bavarians .
they asked 13 experts in the fields of sports marketing , media , sponsoring and sports agents to take a close look at the 18 bundesliga clubs and pass judgment on each side 's market value . bayern winner in seven categories the jury members were asked to judge in categories such as sporting rights , marketing , brand value , media appearance and sponsoring .
the name at the top in seven categories of eight categories was bayern munich .
the only category that the bundesliga 's strongest club had to play second-fiddle in was that of location which went to the hertha berlin . nevertheless , the jurors do n't think that bayern 's management are taking advantage of their position optimally . thomas röttgermann , president of the sports marketing agency sportfive recognized an " unsatisfactory position on the european market " for germany 's most successful soccer club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's michael ballack -lrb- l -rrb- and friends are worth their weight in gold for the club , the marketing giant in the bundesliga it is obvious that the remaining 17 bundesliga clubs must play catch up with their south german rivals , something that hamburg sv clearly managed to do in the past year , making a clear move towards the top and landing on the third spot in the rankings .
last season , they were seventh . the team 's management is young and has watched the team make an abrupt turnaround with the hiring of coach thomas doll last autumn .
riding a 19-game streak since last season without a defeat , hamburg have been named as the strongest challengers to bayern in the 2005-06 season .
the jurors judged the " consistent work in management and image of the brand name " as particularly noteworthy . " hsv has improved its marketing profile and strategic decisions are bearing fruit , " said jens krüger , sponsoring director at tns sport . the eternal bridesmaid : schalke coming second in the survey were the royal blues from schalke .
the team from the ruhr valley , whose explicit goal it has been for years to finally win a bundesliga title , wants to shed the image of the eternal bridesmaid .
club manager rudi assauer , who has never been one to mince words with bayern 's management , still believes that championship will come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : club manager rudi assauer -lrb- r -rrb- and his pride and joy , the arena aufschalke his work since taking over in 1993 has hardly been topped anywhere else .
according to a poll that the cigar-smoking manager had read , schalke is the most-beloved team in germany - outside of bavaria naturally . " the title that was stolen from us -lrb- in 2001 when bayern scored a goal in injury time to beat hamburg -rrb- gave us a huge push to the top , " assauer told sport-bild magazine .
" all those who were just a little neutral , became schalke fans . " surprising promoted sides the consistent relegations and promotions of fc cologne in the past decade have hardly taken away from the club 's appeal .
they came in seventh in the rankings .
hometown german international striker lukas podolski catapulted the team back into the top division and he has a magnetic attraction that brings fans to the rhein energie stadium .
the former all-purpose facility , the former müngersdorfer stadium , underwent a total makeover that transformed it into a pure soccer stadium and is one of the top locations to watch german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski : he is on the rise as well as fc cologne 's marketability another club that just returned to the first league , eintracht frankfurt , came in 10th .
the central german club has never won a bundesliga title , and its sole german championship came in 1959 , nevertheless feels that it has a proud history of achievements that deserves to put on display like bayern munich 's . after the 2006 world cup , it intends to open a club museum at the team 's stadium .
visitors will be able to view frankfurt 's 1980 uefa cup trophy or its four german cup successes .
quite possibly the item that will literally stick out the most will be 1936 olympic champion tilly fleischer 's spear .
she won that as a member in the club 's track and field department . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem .

17 , 2005 -rrb- is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .
he calls on all member states to build up stocks , " said tod , while refusing to say how many or which countries have shortfalls . scientists confirmed on saturday that romania has the lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu - which has killed over 60 people in asia - two days after the killer virus was determined to be present in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 - in gold - in detail .
the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .
on monday a group of flu experts called on the eu to fund development of prototype drugs against bird flu itself - but warned that such research could cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- . " eu should pay for development and clinical trials carried out by industry , because ... there is no market for a prototype , " said professor albert osterhaus of the european scientific working group of influenza , which groups centers such as france 's institut pasteur and germany 's robert koch institute . eu experts in ' hot zones ' of turkey , romania the eu commission meanwhile confirmed that eu experts sent to turkey and bulgaria were already working on the ground , in liaison with authorities from those countries .
eu experts were already dispatched to romania last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts are on the ground in turkey and romania .
the eu executive 's spokesman also said it was sending , at the request of turkey , some 700 protective suits for people working in the affected area in the northwest of the country . eu veterinary experts have already approved a package of measures to bolster europe 's defenses against the virus , notably by ensuring that poultry do not come into contact with wild migratory birds which can carry it . for the moment the eu says the measures it has already taken are enough to keep the lethal bird flu strain at bay .
but " if the situation evolves and further measures are required the commission will immediately react , " said the spokesman , declining to speculate on what such measures could be . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest . if social democrat peer steinbrück had planned to ease quietly into his new role as germany 's finance minister , he missed the chance . surely , it will not be easy to take over the " poisoned chalice " cabinet appointment , given the ongoing struggle to plug gaping holes in the german budget .
but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .
incumbent economy minister wolfgang clement had already proposed such a move two years ago , and it was rejected at the time , the spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical scene on germany 's famed highways but a sale of the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,500 mile -rrb- autobahn network could help alleviate germany 's dire budget shortfall .
according to bild am sonntag , a three-year-old report commissioned in connection with the truck toll system said the german autobahn would fetch around 127 billion euros -lrb- $ 153 billion -rrb- . international investment firms goldman sachs and barclays have already begun jockeying for position with the finance and transport ministries for a role in any potential sale .

"
world war ii began when nazi germany invaded poland on september 1 , 1939 . the allegations caused a storm but were firmly denied by tusk , a member of an ethnic kashubian group inhabiting poland 's north . tusk said the dredging up of the past " overstepped the bounds of decency . " during hitler 's occupation many kashubians , who for centuries nurtured german and polish influence , were forcibly enlisted into the german army . " blows below the belt " tusk has now called for a public apology . " all those who raise a hand to smite the dead are not worthy of respect or power , " tusk told reporters .
although his feelings had been badly hurt , he did not intend to return such " blows below the belt . " but he did add that someone who " could n't control his own staff " should not be president of poland . polish tv reported that documents in berlin archives show that tusk 's grandfather joseph did indeed serve in the wehrmacht for a few months at the end of the war before joining the polish army that fought germans with allied troops .
tusk and others countered that many poles were forced to join the german army . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voting station , which is decorated like a cave , near poznan kaczynski sought to distance himself from the accusations attributed by the weekly to his campaign manager and fired him before apologizing to tusk . " i am not responsible for this type of campaigning , and i will pay the consequences of what was said , " he told reporters . tusk said both his grandfathers had fought in the polish resistance during the war , and had spent part of the conflict in german concentration camps on polish soil . tusk front runner last week , kaczynski finished a close second to tusk in the first round of the presidential election with 36 percent of the vote followed by kaczynski with 33 percent .
the run-off is set for october 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk is the front runner for the presidency a poll published saturday showed that tusk , a free-market liberal , has built significantly on his lead over kaczynski since the first round , and would reap 44 percent of the vote in the run-off , due to be held on october 23 , against 39 percent for his conservative rival . as tusk and kaczynski fight it out for the presidency , their parties are in talks to form a coalition to govern poland .
kaczynski 's conservative and populist roman catholic pis finished first in legislative elections held last month , with tusk 's pro-market civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- just a few points behind . sensitive issue pis has previously resorted to nationalist rhetoric during the campaigns for the legislature and presidency , playing on lingering polish fears of germany and russia . any hints of collaboration with nazi germany are highly damaging in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.10.2005 in the fast lane to controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autobahn is known for the absence of speed limits the autobahn is a german icon , right up there with beer and oktoberfest .
so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest . if social democrat peer steinbrück had planned to ease quietly into his new role as germany 's finance minister , he missed the chance . surely , it will not be easy to take over the " poisoned chalice " cabinet appointment , given the ongoing struggle to plug gaping holes in the german budget .
but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .
incumbent economy minister wolfgang clement had already proposed such a move two years ago , and it was rejected at the time , the spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical scene on germany 's famed highways but a sale of the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,500 mile -rrb- autobahn network could help alleviate germany 's dire budget shortfall .
according to bild am sonntag , a three-year-old report commissioned in connection with the truck toll system said the german autobahn would fetch around 127 billion euros -lrb- $ 153 billion -rrb- . international investment firms goldman sachs and barclays have already begun jockeying for position with the finance and transport ministries for a role in any potential sale .
such a sale could reduce german debt by 890 billion euros , or 15 percent , in one go . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers mull car toll the transportation ministers of germany 's states will discuss a controversial plan to introduce a car toll on the country 's highways on wednesday .

" " the suspension was voluntary and we are not ready to go back on our decision , " he told reporters , sticking by iran 's position that it only wants to make reactor fuel and that it has a right to do so as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . the refusal to suspend work at isfahan means iran is unlikely to resume negotiations with britain , france and germany ahead of the next meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board in november . the so-called eu-3 , backed by the united states , would therefore be expected to push for the case to be referred to the security council . talks between iran and the eu-3 broke down in august , when iran rejected a deal that offered trade and other incentives for a full cessation of fuel cycle work , the focus of fears that iran could acquire nuclear weapons . continued defiance earns iran unlikely support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and iran faced off over enrichment but no deal has stuck iran also ended a freeze on fuel cycle work by resuming uranium conversion - a precursor to potentially dual-use civilian and military enrichment work - in defiance of an accord struck with the eu-3 in paris last november .
" there is no judicial or legal reason to send the iranian dossier to the security council , " asefi asserted . " many countries have this view , " he said , mentioning china and russia as examples and then drifting into greek mythology : " you can not use the threat of the security council like the sword of damocles over the head of iran . " last month beijing abstained from voting on an iaea resolution that found iran to be in non-compliance with the npt , and is eager not to see the tensions with iran escalate . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov also said saturday that moscow saw no reason to put the iranian nuclear issue to the un security council as sought by washington . " we are concentrating on negotiations and dialogue , " asefi said , but acknowledged that full-scale talks with the europeans remained frozen .
" our ambassadors are in contact in european capital and elsewhere .
but these contacts are not like before . " rafsanjani : talks will resume without conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's powerful former president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani former president and top regime official akbar hashemi rafsanjani also asserted that " iran is ready to negotiate but not when preconditions are attached . " the united states maintains that iran simply can not be trusted with the fuel cycle .
" they need to come to a conclusion that will allow them , if they wish , civil nuclear energy , -lrb- and -rrb- to do that without raising concerns in the international community , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the bbc . " the security council option is there , at a time of our choosing , " she said ahead of talks in london with british prime minister tony blair . iran , britain square up over alleged iraq involvement tensions will be high when iran and the eu-3 eventually come back to the discussion table after events over the weekend . relations between tehran and one third of the european negotiation team were dealt a massive blow on sunday when the iranian military authorities accused britain of complicity in two bomb attacks in ahvaz , capital of the oil-rich khuzestan province adjacent to british-occupied southern iraq . the blasts late on saturday night outside a crowded market which killed five people and injured more than 100 was alluded to by iranian military officials as having “ a british accent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops have come under attack and have blamed iran 's influence british forces in basra have claimed that recent attacks have been staged by insurgents supported by iran and the attacks many well have took on the appearance of retaliation in some iranian eyes . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu keeps up pressure on iran the european union kept up pressure on iran wednesday to resume suspended talks , warning that referral to the un security council remains a real risk and saying that tehran faces a " crucial " choice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.10.2005 countries act on bird flu as eu dithers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if bird flu makes it across the border , will europe be ready ?
the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .
he calls on all member states to build up stocks , " said tod , while refusing to say how many or which countries have shortfalls . scientists confirmed on saturday that romania has the lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu - which has killed over 60 people in asia - two days after the killer virus was determined to be present in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 - in gold - in detail .
the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .
on monday a group of flu experts called on the eu to fund development of prototype drugs against bird flu itself - but warned that such research could cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- . " eu should pay for development and clinical trials carried out by industry , because ... there is no market for a prototype , " said professor albert osterhaus of the european scientific working group of influenza , which groups centers such as france 's institut pasteur and germany 's robert koch institute . eu experts in ' hot zones ' of turkey , romania the eu commission meanwhile confirmed that eu experts sent to turkey and bulgaria were already working on the ground , in liaison with authorities from those countries .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .
he calls on all member states to build up stocks , " said tod , while refusing to say how many or which countries have shortfalls . scientists confirmed on saturday that romania has the lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu - which has killed over 60 people in asia - two days after the killer virus was determined to be present in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 - in gold - in detail .
the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .
on monday a group of flu experts called on the eu to fund development of prototype drugs against bird flu itself - but warned that such research could cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- . " eu should pay for development and clinical trials carried out by industry , because ... there is no market for a prototype , " said professor albert osterhaus of the european scientific working group of influenza , which groups centers such as france 's institut pasteur and germany 's robert koch institute . eu experts in ' hot zones ' of turkey , romania the eu commission meanwhile confirmed that eu experts sent to turkey and bulgaria were already working on the ground , in liaison with authorities from those countries .

the aim is to do away with existing patchwork of bilateral agreements between various eu members and the united states and set up one system regulating transatlantic air transport .

it said it would take a variety of measures , such as centralized purchasing , for the two joint ventures and improve cross-venture cooperation between its partners shanghai automotive industry corp -lrb- saic -rrb- and first automotive works .
volkswagen china president and chief executive winfried vahland said a key to this would be differentiation in the positioning of its two joint venture products .
volkswagen , which 20 years ago was the first western auto manufacturer to come into china , was rewarded for its vision with years of near monopoly of the government and taxi vehicle market .
but now , with scandals and financial troubles at home and bloated management in china , the company is struggling in the face of increasing competition .
half-year sales slowed at its two mainland joint ventures to a disappointing 265,000 vehicles after 306,000 for the first half of 2004 .
volkswagen is expected to report disappointing results this year due to eroding margins caused by high material costs , increased competition and a continuing price war .
nevertheless the company said it was committed to introducing 10 to 12 new models before 2009 to the china market , the world 's third largest , that would better cater to local needs .
volkswagen china spokesman kai gruber said the company would seek to reduce production costs by 40 percent over the three-year program .
a stronger focus on in-house developments within its china joint ventures and the addition the skoda brand will be added on to the shanghai volkswagen line starting from 2007 . dw-world.de vw to lose top spot on chinese market us auto giant general motors is snapping at the heels of the german car manufacturer volkswagen , which is likely to lose its position as top dog on the chinese market next year , analysts and industry consultants say .

bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .

"
world war ii began when nazi germany invaded poland on september 1 , 1939 . the allegations caused a storm but were firmly denied by tusk , a member of an ethnic kashubian group inhabiting poland 's north . tusk said the dredging up of the past " overstepped the bounds of decency . " during hitler 's occupation many kashubians , who for centuries nurtured german and polish influence , were forcibly enlisted into the german army . " blows below the belt " tusk has now called for a public apology . " all those who raise a hand to smite the dead are not worthy of respect or power , " tusk told reporters .
although his feelings had been badly hurt , he did not intend to return such " blows below the belt . " but he did add that someone who " could n't control his own staff " should not be president of poland . polish tv reported that documents in berlin archives show that tusk 's grandfather joseph did indeed serve in the wehrmacht for a few months at the end of the war before joining the polish army that fought germans with allied troops .

but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .
incumbent economy minister wolfgang clement had already proposed such a move two years ago , and it was rejected at the time , the spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical scene on germany 's famed highways but a sale of the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,500 mile -rrb- autobahn network could help alleviate germany 's dire budget shortfall .
according to bild am sonntag , a three-year-old report commissioned in connection with the truck toll system said the german autobahn would fetch around 127 billion euros -lrb- $ 153 billion -rrb- . international investment firms goldman sachs and barclays have already begun jockeying for position with the finance and transport ministries for a role in any potential sale .
such a sale could reduce german debt by 890 billion euros , or 15 percent , in one go . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers mull car toll the transportation ministers of germany 's states will discuss a controversial plan to introduce a car toll on the country 's highways on wednesday .

volkswagen china president and chief executive winfried vahland said a key to this would be differentiation in the positioning of its two joint venture products .
volkswagen , which 20 years ago was the first western auto manufacturer to come into china , was rewarded for its vision with years of near monopoly of the government and taxi vehicle market .

nevertheless the company said it was committed to introducing 10 to 12 new models before 2009 to the china market , the world 's third largest , that would better cater to local needs .

"
world war ii began when nazi germany invaded poland on september 1 , 1939 . the allegations caused a storm but were firmly denied by tusk , a member of an ethnic kashubian group inhabiting poland 's north . tusk said the dredging up of the past " overstepped the bounds of decency . " during hitler 's occupation many kashubians , who for centuries nurtured german and polish influence , were forcibly enlisted into the german army . " blows below the belt " tusk has now called for a public apology . " all those who raise a hand to smite the dead are not worthy of respect or power , " tusk told reporters .
although his feelings had been badly hurt , he did not intend to return such " blows below the belt . " but he did add that someone who " could n't control his own staff " should not be president of poland . polish tv reported that documents in berlin archives show that tusk 's grandfather joseph did indeed serve in the wehrmacht for a few months at the end of the war before joining the polish army that fought germans with allied troops .
tusk and others countered that many poles were forced to join the german army . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voting station , which is decorated like a cave , near poznan kaczynski sought to distance himself from the accusations attributed by the weekly to his campaign manager and fired him before apologizing to tusk . " i am not responsible for this type of campaigning , and i will pay the consequences of what was said , " he told reporters . tusk said both his grandfathers had fought in the polish resistance during the war , and had spent part of the conflict in german concentration camps on polish soil . tusk front runner last week , kaczynski finished a close second to tusk in the first round of the presidential election with 36 percent of the vote followed by kaczynski with 33 percent .
the run-off is set for october 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk is the front runner for the presidency a poll published saturday showed that tusk , a free-market liberal , has built significantly on his lead over kaczynski since the first round , and would reap 44 percent of the vote in the run-off , due to be held on october 23 , against 39 percent for his conservative rival . as tusk and kaczynski fight it out for the presidency , their parties are in talks to form a coalition to govern poland .
kaczynski 's conservative and populist roman catholic pis finished first in legislative elections held last month , with tusk 's pro-market civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- just a few points behind . sensitive issue pis has previously resorted to nationalist rhetoric during the campaigns for the legislature and presidency , playing on lingering polish fears of germany and russia . any hints of collaboration with nazi germany are highly damaging in poland .

" " the suspension was voluntary and we are not ready to go back on our decision , " he told reporters , sticking by iran 's position that it only wants to make reactor fuel and that it has a right to do so as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . the refusal to suspend work at isfahan means iran is unlikely to resume negotiations with britain , france and germany ahead of the next meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board in november . the so-called eu-3 , backed by the united states , would therefore be expected to push for the case to be referred to the security council . talks between iran and the eu-3 broke down in august , when iran rejected a deal that offered trade and other incentives for a full cessation of fuel cycle work , the focus of fears that iran could acquire nuclear weapons . continued defiance earns iran unlikely support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and iran faced off over enrichment but no deal has stuck iran also ended a freeze on fuel cycle work by resuming uranium conversion - a precursor to potentially dual-use civilian and military enrichment work - in defiance of an accord struck with the eu-3 in paris last november .
" there is no judicial or legal reason to send the iranian dossier to the security council , " asefi asserted . " many countries have this view , " he said , mentioning china and russia as examples and then drifting into greek mythology : " you can not use the threat of the security council like the sword of damocles over the head of iran . " last month beijing abstained from voting on an iaea resolution that found iran to be in non-compliance with the npt , and is eager not to see the tensions with iran escalate . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov also said saturday that moscow saw no reason to put the iranian nuclear issue to the un security council as sought by washington . " we are concentrating on negotiations and dialogue , " asefi said , but acknowledged that full-scale talks with the europeans remained frozen .
" our ambassadors are in contact in european capital and elsewhere .
but these contacts are not like before . " rafsanjani : talks will resume without conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's powerful former president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani former president and top regime official akbar hashemi rafsanjani also asserted that " iran is ready to negotiate but not when preconditions are attached . " the united states maintains that iran simply can not be trusted with the fuel cycle .
" they need to come to a conclusion that will allow them , if they wish , civil nuclear energy , -lrb- and -rrb- to do that without raising concerns in the international community , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the bbc . " the security council option is there , at a time of our choosing , " she said ahead of talks in london with british prime minister tony blair . iran , britain square up over alleged iraq involvement tensions will be high when iran and the eu-3 eventually come back to the discussion table after events over the weekend . relations between tehran and one third of the european negotiation team were dealt a massive blow on sunday when the iranian military authorities accused britain of complicity in two bomb attacks in ahvaz , capital of the oil-rich khuzestan province adjacent to british-occupied southern iraq . the blasts late on saturday night outside a crowded market which killed five people and injured more than 100 was alluded to by iranian military officials as having “ a british accent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops have come under attack and have blamed iran 's influence british forces in basra have claimed that recent attacks have been staged by insurgents supported by iran and the attacks many well have took on the appearance of retaliation in some iranian eyes . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu keeps up pressure on iran the european union kept up pressure on iran wednesday to resume suspended talks , warning that referral to the un security council remains a real risk and saying that tehran faces a " crucial " choice .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .
he calls on all member states to build up stocks , " said tod , while refusing to say how many or which countries have shortfalls . scientists confirmed on saturday that romania has the lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu - which has killed over 60 people in asia - two days after the killer virus was determined to be present in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 - in gold - in detail .
the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .
on monday a group of flu experts called on the eu to fund development of prototype drugs against bird flu itself - but warned that such research could cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- . " eu should pay for development and clinical trials carried out by industry , because ... there is no market for a prototype , " said professor albert osterhaus of the european scientific working group of influenza , which groups centers such as france 's institut pasteur and germany 's robert koch institute . eu experts in ' hot zones ' of turkey , romania the eu commission meanwhile confirmed that eu experts sent to turkey and bulgaria were already working on the ground , in liaison with authorities from those countries .
eu experts were already dispatched to romania last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts are on the ground in turkey and romania .
the eu executive 's spokesman also said it was sending , at the request of turkey , some 700 protective suits for people working in the affected area in the northwest of the country . eu veterinary experts have already approved a package of measures to bolster europe 's defenses against the virus , notably by ensuring that poultry do not come into contact with wild migratory birds which can carry it . for the moment the eu says the measures it has already taken are enough to keep the lethal bird flu strain at bay .
but " if the situation evolves and further measures are required the commission will immediately react , " said the spokesman , declining to speculate on what such measures could be . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

"
world war ii began when nazi germany invaded poland on september 1 , 1939 . the allegations caused a storm but were firmly denied by tusk , a member of an ethnic kashubian group inhabiting poland 's north . tusk said the dredging up of the past " overstepped the bounds of decency . " during hitler 's occupation many kashubians , who for centuries nurtured german and polish influence , were forcibly enlisted into the german army . " blows below the belt " tusk has now called for a public apology . " all those who raise a hand to smite the dead are not worthy of respect or power , " tusk told reporters .
although his feelings had been badly hurt , he did not intend to return such " blows below the belt . " but he did add that someone who " could n't control his own staff " should not be president of poland . polish tv reported that documents in berlin archives show that tusk 's grandfather joseph did indeed serve in the wehrmacht for a few months at the end of the war before joining the polish army that fought germans with allied troops .
tusk and others countered that many poles were forced to join the german army . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voting station , which is decorated like a cave , near poznan kaczynski sought to distance himself from the accusations attributed by the weekly to his campaign manager and fired him before apologizing to tusk . " i am not responsible for this type of campaigning , and i will pay the consequences of what was said , " he told reporters . tusk said both his grandfathers had fought in the polish resistance during the war , and had spent part of the conflict in german concentration camps on polish soil . tusk front runner last week , kaczynski finished a close second to tusk in the first round of the presidential election with 36 percent of the vote followed by kaczynski with 33 percent .
the run-off is set for october 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk is the front runner for the presidency a poll published saturday showed that tusk , a free-market liberal , has built significantly on his lead over kaczynski since the first round , and would reap 44 percent of the vote in the run-off , due to be held on october 23 , against 39 percent for his conservative rival . as tusk and kaczynski fight it out for the presidency , their parties are in talks to form a coalition to govern poland .
kaczynski 's conservative and populist roman catholic pis finished first in legislative elections held last month , with tusk 's pro-market civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- just a few points behind . sensitive issue pis has previously resorted to nationalist rhetoric during the campaigns for the legislature and presidency , playing on lingering polish fears of germany and russia . any hints of collaboration with nazi germany are highly damaging in poland .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .
he calls on all member states to build up stocks , " said tod , while refusing to say how many or which countries have shortfalls . scientists confirmed on saturday that romania has the lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu - which has killed over 60 people in asia - two days after the killer virus was determined to be present in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 - in gold - in detail .
the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .
on monday a group of flu experts called on the eu to fund development of prototype drugs against bird flu itself - but warned that such research could cost more than 100 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- . " eu should pay for development and clinical trials carried out by industry , because ... there is no market for a prototype , " said professor albert osterhaus of the european scientific working group of influenza , which groups centers such as france 's institut pasteur and germany 's robert koch institute . eu experts in ' hot zones ' of turkey , romania the eu commission meanwhile confirmed that eu experts sent to turkey and bulgaria were already working on the ground , in liaison with authorities from those countries .
eu experts were already dispatched to romania last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts are on the ground in turkey and romania .
the eu executive 's spokesman also said it was sending , at the request of turkey , some 700 protective suits for people working in the affected area in the northwest of the country . eu veterinary experts have already approved a package of measures to bolster europe 's defenses against the virus , notably by ensuring that poultry do not come into contact with wild migratory birds which can carry it . for the moment the eu says the measures it has already taken are enough to keep the lethal bird flu strain at bay .
but " if the situation evolves and further measures are required the commission will immediately react , " said the spokesman , declining to speculate on what such measures could be . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

" " the suspension was voluntary and we are not ready to go back on our decision , " he told reporters , sticking by iran 's position that it only wants to make reactor fuel and that it has a right to do so as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . the refusal to suspend work at isfahan means iran is unlikely to resume negotiations with britain , france and germany ahead of the next meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board in november . the so-called eu-3 , backed by the united states , would therefore be expected to push for the case to be referred to the security council . talks between iran and the eu-3 broke down in august , when iran rejected a deal that offered trade and other incentives for a full cessation of fuel cycle work , the focus of fears that iran could acquire nuclear weapons . continued defiance earns iran unlikely support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and iran faced off over enrichment but no deal has stuck iran also ended a freeze on fuel cycle work by resuming uranium conversion - a precursor to potentially dual-use civilian and military enrichment work - in defiance of an accord struck with the eu-3 in paris last november .
" there is no judicial or legal reason to send the iranian dossier to the security council , " asefi asserted . " many countries have this view , " he said , mentioning china and russia as examples and then drifting into greek mythology : " you can not use the threat of the security council like the sword of damocles over the head of iran . " last month beijing abstained from voting on an iaea resolution that found iran to be in non-compliance with the npt , and is eager not to see the tensions with iran escalate . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov also said saturday that moscow saw no reason to put the iranian nuclear issue to the un security council as sought by washington . " we are concentrating on negotiations and dialogue , " asefi said , but acknowledged that full-scale talks with the europeans remained frozen .
" our ambassadors are in contact in european capital and elsewhere .
but these contacts are not like before . " rafsanjani : talks will resume without conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's powerful former president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani former president and top regime official akbar hashemi rafsanjani also asserted that " iran is ready to negotiate but not when preconditions are attached . " the united states maintains that iran simply can not be trusted with the fuel cycle .
" they need to come to a conclusion that will allow them , if they wish , civil nuclear energy , -lrb- and -rrb- to do that without raising concerns in the international community , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the bbc . " the security council option is there , at a time of our choosing , " she said ahead of talks in london with british prime minister tony blair . iran , britain square up over alleged iraq involvement tensions will be high when iran and the eu-3 eventually come back to the discussion table after events over the weekend . relations between tehran and one third of the european negotiation team were dealt a massive blow on sunday when the iranian military authorities accused britain of complicity in two bomb attacks in ahvaz , capital of the oil-rich khuzestan province adjacent to british-occupied southern iraq . the blasts late on saturday night outside a crowded market which killed five people and injured more than 100 was alluded to by iranian military officials as having “ a british accent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british troops have come under attack and have blamed iran 's influence british forces in basra have claimed that recent attacks have been staged by insurgents supported by iran and the attacks many well have took on the appearance of retaliation in some iranian eyes . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu keeps up pressure on iran the european union kept up pressure on iran wednesday to resume suspended talks , warning that referral to the un security council remains a real risk and saying that tehran faces a " crucial " choice .

so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest . if social democrat peer steinbrück had planned to ease quietly into his new role as germany 's finance minister , he missed the chance . surely , it will not be easy to take over the " poisoned chalice " cabinet appointment , given the ongoing struggle to plug gaping holes in the german budget .
but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .
incumbent economy minister wolfgang clement had already proposed such a move two years ago , and it was rejected at the time , the spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical scene on germany 's famed highways but a sale of the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,500 mile -rrb- autobahn network could help alleviate germany 's dire budget shortfall .
according to bild am sonntag , a three-year-old report commissioned in connection with the truck toll system said the german autobahn would fetch around 127 billion euros -lrb- $ 153 billion -rrb- . international investment firms goldman sachs and barclays have already begun jockeying for position with the finance and transport ministries for a role in any potential sale .
such a sale could reduce german debt by 890 billion euros , or 15 percent , in one go . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers mull car toll the transportation ministers of germany 's states will discuss a controversial plan to introduce a car toll on the country 's highways on wednesday .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .
he calls on all member states to build up stocks , " said tod , while refusing to say how many or which countries have shortfalls . scientists confirmed on saturday that romania has the lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu - which has killed over 60 people in asia - two days after the killer virus was determined to be present in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 - in gold - in detail .
the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .

the german state of bavaria took the initiative in the battle against bird flu monday and banned poultry fairs and markets while the eu admitted it was struggling get to grip with the threat on its borders . the german state of bavaria on monday banned poultry fairs and markets in a precautionary measure against bird flu , the state 's interior ministry announced .
bavaria , one of the biggest of the country 's 16 regional states , hopes to persuade other states to introduce similar measures . the german government on friday urged the regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against a possible epidemic . it appeared that the german government was putting some of the responsibility of containing a possible bird flu outbreak in the hands of the public as it became clear over the last few days that european countries were ill equipped with the necessary medicine to cope with a pandemic . drug shortage forces eu to issue stockpile order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso .
the european commission voiced concern monday about shortages of anti-viral drugs needed in case of a feared flu pandemic , pressing eu governments to stockpile more of them as alarm over bird flu mounts . the european union 's executive arm , giving an update on the situation after a lethal bird flu strain was confirmed on the continent saturday , also said it could take further measures to protect europe against the disease if necessary . " we are not seeking to be alarmist , " said philip tod , spokesman for eu health commissioner markos kyprianou .
" we are fulfilling our duty to help member states prepare and to coordinate their preparations . " specifically , he said a number of eu states do not have enough stocks of anti-viral drugs for human flu to cover 25 percent of the population - as recommended by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in the event of a pandemic . not all member states have " sufficient stocks " kyprianou " is concerned by the fact that not all member states have sufficient stocks .
he calls on all member states to build up stocks , " said tod , while refusing to say how many or which countries have shortfalls . scientists confirmed on saturday that romania has the lethal h5n1 strain of bird flu - which has killed over 60 people in asia - two days after the killer virus was determined to be present in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird influenza virus strain h5n1 - in gold - in detail .
the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . while the eu is keen not to spark panic , official calls for calm have not prevented a rush for anti-viral drugs and stocks in some countries are reported to be running short . virus has become resistant to flu drug fueling further concern , a study released friday said researchers had identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight to find a drug that combats bird flu goes on .

it is clear that bayern munich are the tops in the bundesliga both on and off the field .
yet who is behind them trying to get a piece of the big marketing pie in the league reveals a few surprises . bayern munich have the league cornered .
the club led by coach felix magath sit atop the league after eight match days but the competition is hot on their heels - hamburg , bremen and schalke look to dethrone the champions . where the " dwarves " - this would naturally be taken with great offense by fans - will have more difficulties is the marketing area .
prestige and success pay off and companies want to be associated with the sports teams that can consistently bring home the championship , win the country 's cup , and even occasionally rise to the top and beat the best teams in europe . bayern munich do this on a consistent basis and receive the spoils for their hard work .
now a study by the frankfurt-based horizont sport business publishing house show that in extremely clear terms - nobody does it better in german soccer than the bavarians .
they asked 13 experts in the fields of sports marketing , media , sponsoring and sports agents to take a close look at the 18 bundesliga clubs and pass judgment on each side 's market value . bayern winner in seven categories the jury members were asked to judge in categories such as sporting rights , marketing , brand value , media appearance and sponsoring .
the name at the top in seven categories of eight categories was bayern munich .
the only category that the bundesliga 's strongest club had to play second-fiddle in was that of location which went to the hertha berlin . nevertheless , the jurors do n't think that bayern 's management are taking advantage of their position optimally . thomas röttgermann , president of the sports marketing agency sportfive recognized an " unsatisfactory position on the european market " for germany 's most successful soccer club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's michael ballack -lrb- l -rrb- and friends are worth their weight in gold for the club , the marketing giant in the bundesliga it is obvious that the remaining 17 bundesliga clubs must play catch up with their south german rivals , something that hamburg sv clearly managed to do in the past year , making a clear move towards the top and landing on the third spot in the rankings .
last season , they were seventh . the team 's management is young and has watched the team make an abrupt turnaround with the hiring of coach thomas doll last autumn .
riding a 19-game streak since last season without a defeat , hamburg have been named as the strongest challengers to bayern in the 2005-06 season .
the jurors judged the " consistent work in management and image of the brand name " as particularly noteworthy . " hsv has improved its marketing profile and strategic decisions are bearing fruit , " said jens krüger , sponsoring director at tns sport . the eternal bridesmaid : schalke coming second in the survey were the royal blues from schalke .
the team from the ruhr valley , whose explicit goal it has been for years to finally win a bundesliga title , wants to shed the image of the eternal bridesmaid .
club manager rudi assauer , who has never been one to mince words with bayern 's management , still believes that championship will come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : club manager rudi assauer -lrb- r -rrb- and his pride and joy , the arena aufschalke his work since taking over in 1993 has hardly been topped anywhere else .
according to a poll that the cigar-smoking manager had read , schalke is the most-beloved team in germany - outside of bavaria naturally . " the title that was stolen from us -lrb- in 2001 when bayern scored a goal in injury time to beat hamburg -rrb- gave us a huge push to the top , " assauer told sport-bild magazine .
" all those who were just a little neutral , became schalke fans . " surprising promoted sides the consistent relegations and promotions of fc cologne in the past decade have hardly taken away from the club 's appeal .
they came in seventh in the rankings .
hometown german international striker lukas podolski catapulted the team back into the top division and he has a magnetic attraction that brings fans to the rhein energie stadium .
the former all-purpose facility , the former müngersdorfer stadium , underwent a total makeover that transformed it into a pure soccer stadium and is one of the top locations to watch german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski : he is on the rise as well as fc cologne 's marketability another club that just returned to the first league , eintracht frankfurt , came in 10th .
the central german club has never won a bundesliga title , and its sole german championship came in 1959 , nevertheless feels that it has a proud history of achievements that deserves to put on display like bayern munich 's . after the 2006 world cup , it intends to open a club museum at the team 's stadium .
visitors will be able to view frankfurt 's 1980 uefa cup trophy or its four german cup successes .
quite possibly the item that will literally stick out the most will be 1936 olympic champion tilly fleischer 's spear .
she won that as a member in the club 's track and field department . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest . if social democrat peer steinbrück had planned to ease quietly into his new role as germany 's finance minister , he missed the chance . surely , it will not be easy to take over the " poisoned chalice " cabinet appointment , given the ongoing struggle to plug gaping holes in the german budget .
but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .
incumbent economy minister wolfgang clement had already proposed such a move two years ago , and it was rejected at the time , the spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical scene on germany 's famed highways but a sale of the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,500 mile -rrb- autobahn network could help alleviate germany 's dire budget shortfall .
according to bild am sonntag , a three-year-old report commissioned in connection with the truck toll system said the german autobahn would fetch around 127 billion euros -lrb- $ 153 billion -rrb- . international investment firms goldman sachs and barclays have already begun jockeying for position with the finance and transport ministries for a role in any potential sale .
such a sale could reduce german debt by 890 billion euros , or 15 percent , in one go . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers mull car toll the transportation ministers of germany 's states will discuss a controversial plan to introduce a car toll on the country 's highways on wednesday .

it is clear that bayern munich are the tops in the bundesliga both on and off the field .
yet who is behind them trying to get a piece of the big marketing pie in the league reveals a few surprises . bayern munich have the league cornered .
the club led by coach felix magath sit atop the league after eight match days but the competition is hot on their heels - hamburg , bremen and schalke look to dethrone the champions . where the " dwarves " - this would naturally be taken with great offense by fans - will have more difficulties is the marketing area .
prestige and success pay off and companies want to be associated with the sports teams that can consistently bring home the championship , win the country 's cup , and even occasionally rise to the top and beat the best teams in europe . bayern munich do this on a consistent basis and receive the spoils for their hard work .
now a study by the frankfurt-based horizont sport business publishing house show that in extremely clear terms - nobody does it better in german soccer than the bavarians .
they asked 13 experts in the fields of sports marketing , media , sponsoring and sports agents to take a close look at the 18 bundesliga clubs and pass judgment on each side 's market value . bayern winner in seven categories the jury members were asked to judge in categories such as sporting rights , marketing , brand value , media appearance and sponsoring .
the name at the top in seven categories of eight categories was bayern munich .
the only category that the bundesliga 's strongest club had to play second-fiddle in was that of location which went to the hertha berlin . nevertheless , the jurors do n't think that bayern 's management are taking advantage of their position optimally . thomas röttgermann , president of the sports marketing agency sportfive recognized an " unsatisfactory position on the european market " for germany 's most successful soccer club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's michael ballack -lrb- l -rrb- and friends are worth their weight in gold for the club , the marketing giant in the bundesliga it is obvious that the remaining 17 bundesliga clubs must play catch up with their south german rivals , something that hamburg sv clearly managed to do in the past year , making a clear move towards the top and landing on the third spot in the rankings .
last season , they were seventh . the team 's management is young and has watched the team make an abrupt turnaround with the hiring of coach thomas doll last autumn .
riding a 19-game streak since last season without a defeat , hamburg have been named as the strongest challengers to bayern in the 2005-06 season .
the jurors judged the " consistent work in management and image of the brand name " as particularly noteworthy . " hsv has improved its marketing profile and strategic decisions are bearing fruit , " said jens krüger , sponsoring director at tns sport . the eternal bridesmaid : schalke coming second in the survey were the royal blues from schalke .
the team from the ruhr valley , whose explicit goal it has been for years to finally win a bundesliga title , wants to shed the image of the eternal bridesmaid .
club manager rudi assauer , who has never been one to mince words with bayern 's management , still believes that championship will come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : club manager rudi assauer -lrb- r -rrb- and his pride and joy , the arena aufschalke his work since taking over in 1993 has hardly been topped anywhere else .
according to a poll that the cigar-smoking manager had read , schalke is the most-beloved team in germany - outside of bavaria naturally . " the title that was stolen from us -lrb- in 2001 when bayern scored a goal in injury time to beat hamburg -rrb- gave us a huge push to the top , " assauer told sport-bild magazine .
" all those who were just a little neutral , became schalke fans . " surprising promoted sides the consistent relegations and promotions of fc cologne in the past decade have hardly taken away from the club 's appeal .
they came in seventh in the rankings .
hometown german international striker lukas podolski catapulted the team back into the top division and he has a magnetic attraction that brings fans to the rhein energie stadium .
the former all-purpose facility , the former müngersdorfer stadium , underwent a total makeover that transformed it into a pure soccer stadium and is one of the top locations to watch german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski : he is on the rise as well as fc cologne 's marketability another club that just returned to the first league , eintracht frankfurt , came in 10th .
the central german club has never won a bundesliga title , and its sole german championship came in 1959 , nevertheless feels that it has a proud history of achievements that deserves to put on display like bayern munich 's . after the 2006 world cup , it intends to open a club museum at the team 's stadium .
visitors will be able to view frankfurt 's 1980 uefa cup trophy or its four german cup successes .
quite possibly the item that will literally stick out the most will be 1936 olympic champion tilly fleischer 's spear .
she won that as a member in the club 's track and field department . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .

world war ii began when nazi germany invaded poland on september 1 , 1939 . the allegations caused a storm but were firmly denied by tusk , a member of an ethnic kashubian group inhabiting poland 's north . tusk said the dredging up of the past " overstepped the bounds of decency .

" blows below the belt " tusk has now called for a public apology . " all those who raise a hand to smite the dead are not worthy of respect or power , " tusk told reporters .
although his feelings had been badly hurt , he did not intend to return such " blows below the belt . " but he did add that someone who " could n't control his own staff " should not be president of poland . polish tv reported that documents in berlin archives show that tusk 's grandfather joseph did indeed serve in the wehrmacht for a few months at the end of the war before joining the polish army that fought germans with allied troops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.10.2005 in the fast lane to controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autobahn is known for the absence of speed limits the autobahn is a german icon , right up there with beer and oktoberfest .
so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest . if social democrat peer steinbrück had planned to ease quietly into his new role as germany 's finance minister , he missed the chance . surely , it will not be easy to take over the " poisoned chalice " cabinet appointment , given the ongoing struggle to plug gaping holes in the german budget .
but steinbrück 's comments over the weekend that the new government would consider privatizing the autobahn has unleashed a storm of opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jams would still be 'made in germany ' , however steinbrück - who is expected to be named the country 's finance minister later monday when chancellor-elect angela merkel names her cabinet in berlin - made the comment in a weekend interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag . steinbrück : no auto tolls " we have to weigh -lrb- the option -rrb- carefully , " steinbrück said when the paper asked him whether the grand coalition government of social democrats and the conservatives would consider selling states assets such as the national highway network . " the discussion over such things is just beginning , and my opinion is in no way set , " he said . but steinbrück denied that considering the move means he indirectly supports a toll system for passenger cars .
a controversial toll system for trucks went into effect last year . " i want to make it clear that i have in no way argued in favor of creating a toll system for passenger cars , " steinbrück told the reuters news service .
he also stressed that the finance ministry had not even commissioned a report on the value of selling the highway system . sale would bring benefits but a speaker for the transportation ministry under the outgoing government told reuters that selling the autobahn would amount to nothing less than a toll on cars .
current transportation minister manfred stolpe has " clearly rejected " such a proposal .
incumbent economy minister wolfgang clement had already proposed such a move two years ago , and it was rejected at the time , the spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical scene on germany 's famed highways but a sale of the 12,000 kilometer -lrb- 7,500 mile -rrb- autobahn network could help alleviate germany 's dire budget shortfall .
according to bild am sonntag , a three-year-old report commissioned in connection with the truck toll system said the german autobahn would fetch around 127 billion euros -lrb- $ 153 billion -rrb- . international investment firms goldman sachs and barclays have already begun jockeying for position with the finance and transport ministries for a role in any potential sale .
such a sale could reduce german debt by 890 billion euros , or 15 percent , in one go . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers mull car toll the transportation ministers of germany 's states will discuss a controversial plan to introduce a car toll on the country 's highways on wednesday .

a confidant of conservative former chancellor helmut kohl , he is returning to the job he occupied from 1989 to 1991 , to add some much-needed experience to the cabinet . appointing only a part of the cabinet was the price merkel paid for evicting gerhard schröder from the chancellery after seven years in a power-sharing deal which hands his social democrats eight of the 14 cabinet posts , including the key finance and foreign ministries . a bavarian in berlin merkel made her announcement shortly before the hard bargaining begins to hammer out a program for the new government , in the first acid test for an alliance of political enemies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu leader edmund stoiber and german chancellor-to-be angela merkel even before merkel faces the difficulties posed by managing the social democrat ministers , she has clashed with stoiber , who leads the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . merkel fought against stoiber 's wish to bring his trusted ally horst seehofer into the government because seehofer has been a fierce critic of the conservatives ' proposals to reform the health system . csu party leadership , however , voted unanimously for seehofer 's appointment as agriculture minister , sources close to the csu said on monday morning . clashes or camaraderie ? merkel has dismissed fears that her administration will get bogged down in inter-party squabbles . " i see a spirit of camaraderie in this new government , " she told monday 's issue of der spiegel magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right , will play no role in the government schröder will play no role in the new administration , yet many observers saw his influence in the line-up of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- ministers named last week . they included schröder 's former right-hand man , frank-walter steinmeier , as foreign minister , and peer steinbrück , the former premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , as finance minister . spd party leader franz müntefering , another schröder ally -lrb- photo -rrb- , will be vice-chancellor . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a government program may take as long as four weeks the negotiations on the government 's program could take four weeks and the cabinet may not be sworn in until mid-november . there are signs merkel has agreed to water down her more radical proposals to boost the economy , such as cutting employers ' costs .
with the social democrats watching her every move , she is expected to be forced into constant compromise . the conservatives have identified four issues that must be agreed on in the negotiations - a new budget , reviving the labor market and the welfare system and introducing tax reforms to promote economic growth . the first so-called grand coalition government in germany since the 1960s will take office with a mandate to cut an unemployment rate which is currently stuck above 11 percent .
the economy is hardly growing and faces intense competition from low-cost eastern european neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks strong allies for cabinet germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel huddled with party leaders on friday seeking big-hitting conservative ministers able to hold their own against coalition partners loyal to gerhard schröder .

the firm said it expects overall pre-tax profits to rise 9 % in the six months to 30 september .
revenues at its music division are set to rise by 4.5 % , while those from its music publishing arm will grow 5.5 % .
successful releases from artists such as paul mccartney and kt tunstall helped boost revenues despite a " weaker than expected recorded music market " .
emi added that the strong sales combined with its restructuring drive would help offset higher marketing costs which have been triggered by a heavy release schedule .
it added it was on track to deliver full year results in line with expectations .
the news from the trading update was in direct contrast to the firm 's full year profits in may , which fell 13 % to £ 141.9m -lrb- $ 259.5m -rrb- after albums from coldplay and the gorillaz - two key revenue drivers - were delayed .
digital sales at the group - which in may accounted for 2.5 % of its revenues - were also continuing to " enjoy very strong growth year-on-year " .

the firm said it expects overall pre-tax profits to rise 9 % in the six months to 30 september .
revenues at its music division are set to rise by 4.5 % , while those from its music publishing arm will grow 5.5 % .
successful releases from artists such as paul mccartney and kt tunstall helped boost revenues despite a " weaker than expected recorded music market " .
emi added that the strong sales combined with its restructuring drive would help offset higher marketing costs which have been triggered by a heavy release schedule .
it added it was on track to deliver full year results in line with expectations .
the news from the trading update was in direct contrast to the firm 's full year profits in may , which fell 13 % to £ 141.9m -lrb- $ 259.5m -rrb- after albums from coldplay and the gorillaz - two key revenue drivers - were delayed .
digital sales at the group - which in may accounted for 2.5 % of its revenues - were also continuing to " enjoy very strong growth year-on-year " .
emi will release its interim results on 16 november .

a year ago , the cleveland force faced a £ 7m deficit , prompting a raft of cost-cutting measures and a government grant of £ 6m .
now the force says it plans to invest £ 1m to tackle violent crime and anti-social behaviour .
the cash will fund a range of special operations in the area .
a spokesman for cleveland police authority said : " it was reported to the authority recently that our financial position had hugely improved from the position not so long ago when we had to tackle a potential multi-million pound black hole .
' excellent news ' " so much so that we have a considerable surplus on our budget .
we decided that a top priority was to use some of the money to provide an immediate shot in the arm to those areas of crime causing most concern , including drink-related violence and anti-social behaviour . "
chief constable sean price said : " cleveland police has made significant progress over the past two years , both financially and operationally , and it is excellent news that the public can now reap the rewards in this way .
" this investment sends out a clear message that ourselves and the authority regard such behaviour as unacceptable and we are determined to bring to justice anyone engaging in such activity .
" it is especially important that we have the resources to tackle this issue as we move towards the introduction of new licensing arrangements next month . "

issues related to the environmental impact of business , from water use to waste disposal , are coming ever more under the scrutiny of governments .
at the same time , consumers are less likely to turn a blind eye to poor environmental performance .
but it is undoubtedly in the proliferation of environmental regulation that businesses are feeling this shift most profoundly .
global summits , european directives , waste and emissions targets are giving rise to a wide array of regulations forcing companies to take action to reduce their impact on the environment .
ask dr martin gibson a question the harsh reality is that poor environmental performance has consequences for profitability , competitiveness , reputation and staff morale .
it is too big an issue to ignore .
' punitive costs ' a raft of new regulation will continue to increase the expense of environmental performance .
it is estimated that waste already costs businesses in the uk £ 15bn per year while , in many cases , failure to comply with regulations leaves businesses liable to punitive taxes and fines .
for small businesses in particular , these are significant developments .
unlike their larger cousins , they do not necessarily have either the resources or the expertise to comply with new regulation , which affects their ability to compete and , ultimately , survive .
the best way to deal with the demands of environmental regulations is to anticipate them and take appropriate action before it is too late .
however , envirowise - the government funded body charged with helping companies reduce their environmental impact and costs - estimates that at least 30 % of small businesses are struggling to keep up with existing and planned regulations that include : the european hazardous waste directive .
this specifies new rules on landfill and hazardous waste .
it bans the disposal of hazardous waste with non-hazardous waste in landfill .
all businesses disposing of hazardous waste are responsible for dealing with it properly .
the pollution prevention and control regime covers measures to reduce environmental impact and includes energy efficiency , waste minimisation , vibration and noise .
companies must implement management systems to ensure that all prevention and control measures are taken .
the producer responsibility regulations 1997 ensure that businesses take responsibility for the packaging waste they generate .
the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directives work together to protect human health and the environment by restricting the use of certain hazardous substances and reduce waste from electrical equipment .
both are due to come in to force in summer 2006 .
general advice envirowise is working to help businesses across all sectors of the economy - a process that is part education , part inspiration .
our focus is firmly on ensuring that companies throughout the uk are ready to implement new regulation , are able to comply with it and are in a position to realise cost savings along the way .

this year the company will launch its first in-house pantomime productions with stars including simon callow and richard wilson , in conjunction with clear channel .
" for most people in this country , pantomime is still the first time that they go to the theatre , " says ms squire .

the fact that there was good theatre in nottingham certainly changed my life rosemary squire growing up in a village outside nottingham , ms squire 's own interest in theatre was sparked by the potent cocktail of richard eyre and the nottingham playhouse in the 1970s .
" the fact that there was good theatre in nottingham certainly changed my life , " says ms squire .

since joining ambassador in 1997 , she has spearheaded the company 's phenomenal expansion , adding 17 theatres to the group 's portfolio in the past six years .
earlier this week the group acquired its 11th theatre in the west end , when it jointly purchased the 1,200-seat savoy theatre , with a view to producing more large-scale musicals along the lines of guys and dolls .

" a lot of our london theatres are playhouses , which only attract tourists with english as a first language , so we are looking to diversify . " says ms squire .
" celebrity casting definitely helps . "
squire hopes to repeat the success of guy and dolls at the savoy theatre " when you get a star like ewan mcgregor in guys and dolls you will sell out , but it 's not very often that a huge international star like ewan wants to do stage work for seven months of his career . "

the ernst and young item club - which uses the treasury 's own economic model to gauge the uk economy - says it will only grow at 1.6 % this year .
in the last budget , the chancellor had predicted growth of 3 % to 3.5 % .
the group added that mr brown had failed to heed signs of a slowdown , and could not blame external factors such as rising oil prices for the problem .
" the chancellor is blaming the uk economic slowdown on the recent spike in oil prices and the weakness of the european economy , but this is unrealistic , " the item club 's chief economic adviser professor peter spencer said .
" these developments show just how flimsy the current budgetary framework is .
reform of the fiscal rules is long overdue peter spencer , item club " the problems were plain to see at the time of last year 's pre-budget report in december , but instead of addressing them then , the treasury chose to dress up the uk finances for the election . "
" the simple fact is that he 'd already run out of money this time last year , " prof spencer told bbc radio five live .
" but a prudent chancellor would keep some money in the bank so that he could do something about it . "
in recent weeks mr brown has admitted that economic growth will not reach his target this year , although the next official growth forecast will come in november 's pre-budget report .
warnings ignored prof spencer added that the problem could be traced back to the housing market boom and strong consumer spending - which had propped up the economy until recently .
he argued that the chancellor had planned for the property market and consumer spending to keep the uk economy going while the world economy and exports were weak .
however , while the world economy has recovered , exports are recovering very slowly .
those factors coupled with the recent slowdown in the housing market and the delayed impact of rising oil prices means that shoppers are now facing a " added squeeze " which will continue to weigh on the economy , said prof spencer .
looking ahead , the item club is " cautiously predicting " a gdp rise of 2.2 % for 2006 , but added that this was dependent on sustained growth in the world economy and a recovery in exports and investments .
it said that this year 's public borrowing figures were unlikely to be much better than last year 's deficit with the chancellor thought to be facing an £ 11bn black hole in his accounts .
prof spencer also criticised mr brown for revising the dates of the economic cycle in order to make sure that he met his " golden rule " - that borrowing should not exceed current spending over the whole cycle .
" these developments show just how flimsy the current budgetary framework is .
reform of the fiscal rules is long overdue , " he said .

looking ahead , the item club is " cautiously predicting " a gdp rise of 2.2 % for 2006 , but added that this was dependent on sustained growth in the world economy and a recovery in exports and investments .
it said that this year 's public borrowing figures were unlikely to be much better than last year 's deficit with the chancellor thought to be facing an £ 11bn black hole in his accounts .
prof spencer also criticised mr brown for revising the dates of the economic cycle in order to make sure that he met his " golden rule " - that borrowing should not exceed current spending over the whole cycle .
" these developments show just how flimsy the current budgetary framework is .
reform of the fiscal rules is long overdue , " he said .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- analysis : is nuclear power the answer ?
bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 17 october 2005 , 08:26 gmt 09:26 uk analysis : is nuclear power the answer ?
with prime minister tony blair calling for an " open-minded " debate on the future of nuclear power in the uk , the bbc 's alex kirby explores the pros and cons of atomic energy .
nuclear power looks as if it should be the answer to all our energy conundrums , and perhaps even to climate change .
it provides a steady stream of energy , and does not depend on hydrocarbon supplies from unstable regimes .
it is the nearest thing we have to a non-polluting energy source , apart from natural renewables .
but it still engenders massive distrust , so much that many people say it can never be part of the way to avoid a disastrously warming world .
nuclear energy has always had its proponents , their ranks swollen now by people who dislike the technology but believe it may be essential .
they point out that a reactor emits virtually no carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the main greenhouse gas released from human activities -lrb- though of course building the power station produces a lot of co2 -rrb- .
uk 's energy pressures supplies of cheap domestic gas are running low oil and gas prices have risen dramatically government aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % of 1990 levels by 2010 nuclear generates 20 % of the uk 's electricity all but one of uk 's nuclear power stations are set to close by 2023 and no more are planned they say nuclear power is safe , and that the 1957 windscale fire in the uk , three mile island in the us in 1979 , and even chernobyl have killed massively fewer people than the oil and coal industries .
beyond that , they say modern reactors are inherently far safer than those built 20 or 30 years ago , reducing a small risk still further .
supporters say uranium prices have remained steady for decades , meaning nuclear energy is far more secure than fossil fuels can ever be .
and they argue that modern nuclear power systems are far more economic than the older versions , and are therefore a good investment .
and yet their opponents insist that , if nuclear power really is the answer , then we must be asking the wrong question .
terror fears there is an inevitable link between civil and military atoms , they retort .
if we say we need them to stave off climate change , then so can countries like iran and north korea - and there is no impermeable barrier between electricity and bombs .
nuclear : back on the agenda in his 2005 party conference speech , prime minister tony blair promised an energy review in 2006 he said " assessment of all options , including civil nuclear power " was necessary trade secretary alan johnson has said a decision on new nuclear power stations must be made " pretty soon " the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- was set up in april 2005 to take responsibility for all uk decommissioning the committee on radioactive waste management -lrb- corwm -rrb- , set up to recommend options for waste disposal , is due to report in 2006 they say nuclear energy is economic only under a very restricted analysis - by the time you have factored in the costs of construction , insurance , waste disposal and decommissioning , you need huge subsidies .
and , opponents ask , what happens to the waste ?
the only answer we have come up with so far entails storing the most radioactive waste under guard for millennia , until it has decayed to safe levels .
certainly nuclear power would provide energy to a centralised supply system .
but it would do nothing directly to reduce co2 from transport , unless it made the advent of the hydrogen economy likelier .
also , given the long planning and construction lead times , it would be a good decade or so before we saw any new power stations , even if we decided to go ahead today .
i once heard from a british environment secretary , chris -lrb- now lord -rrb- patten , a telling definition of the problem .
" nuclear power ?
to most people , it 's witchcraft , " he told his hearers .
have your say : are more reactors needed ?
most of us worry far more about something that we see as very unlikely but grotesquely horrible than we do about what we perceive as far likelier but much more mundane .
we have a horror of dying in an air crash , but not of driving to the airport along far more dangerous roads .
we fear radioactive death , but cock an insouciant snook at the risk of dying painfully from the effects of smoking , or obesity , or alcohol .
to that degree , our distrust of nuclear energy may be partly irrational .
in other ways , though , it makes very good sense .
consumer demand getting rid of civil reactors would not remove the risk of a nuclear war breaking out , but it would reduce it .
beyond that , in the past , the nuclear industry -lrb- at least in the uk -rrb- has at times been cavalier with the truth .
one conservative minister said 15 years ago : " it is depressing to stand up in the house of commons and broadcast explicit assurances from our nuclear ' experts ' one day , only to find them discredited the next . "
a veteran of the nuclear industry wrote this : " what the industry needs to regain the support of the british public is ... something akin to a truth and reconciliation commission .
" it needs to be admitted that governments and industry lied to the public about the links with the military programme " -lrb- nuclear europe worldscan , 1998 -rrb- .
the signs are that the captains of today 's industry are different and far more open .
but the distrust persists .
two sets of figures crystallise the dilemma .
the uk 's nuclear power stations produce about 20 % of the country 's electricity , and by 2023 all are due to have closed .
but by 2030 it is estimated world co2 emissions will be 62 % higher than today , as global demand for energy grows .
by mid-century we could be on the verge of producing power from nuclear fusion , a radically different technology .
getting from here to there is the tricky bit .
we are understandably terrified of nuclear meltdown , but far fewer of us yet fear the prospect of planetary overheating as we should .

with prime minister tony blair calling for an " open-minded " debate on the future of nuclear power in the uk , the bbc 's alex kirby explores the pros and cons of atomic energy .
sizewell b , the uk 's newest reactor , was built in the 1980s nuclear power looks as if it should be the answer to all our energy conundrums , and perhaps even to climate change .
it provides a steady stream of energy , and does not depend on hydrocarbon supplies from unstable regimes .
it is the nearest thing we have to a non-polluting energy source , apart from natural renewables .
but it still engenders massive distrust , so much that many people say it can never be part of the way to avoid a disastrously warming world .
nuclear energy has always had its proponents , their ranks swollen now by people who dislike the technology but believe it may be essential .
they point out that a reactor emits virtually no carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the main greenhouse gas released from human activities -lrb- though of course building the power station produces a lot of co2 -rrb- .
uk 's energy pressures supplies of cheap domestic gas are running low oil and gas prices have risen dramatically government aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % of 1990 levels by 2010 nuclear generates 20 % of the uk 's electricity all but one of uk 's nuclear power stations are set to close by 2023 and no more are planned they say nuclear power is safe , and that the 1957 windscale fire in the uk , three mile island in the us in 1979 , and even chernobyl have killed massively fewer people than the oil and coal industries .
beyond that , they say modern reactors are inherently far safer than those built 20 or 30 years ago , reducing a small risk still further .
supporters say uranium prices have remained steady for decades , meaning nuclear energy is far more secure than fossil fuels can ever be .
and they argue that modern nuclear power systems are far more economic than the older versions , and are therefore a good investment .
and yet their opponents insist that , if nuclear power really is the answer , then we must be asking the wrong question .
terror fears there is an inevitable link between civil and military atoms , they retort .
if we say we need them to stave off climate change , then so can countries like iran and north korea - and there is no impermeable barrier between electricity and bombs .
nuclear : back on the agenda in his 2005 party conference speech , prime minister tony blair promised an energy review in 2006 he said " assessment of all options , including civil nuclear power " was necessary trade secretary alan johnson has said a decision on new nuclear power stations must be made " pretty soon " the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- was set up in april 2005 to take responsibility for all uk decommissioning the committee on radioactive waste management -lrb- corwm -rrb- , set up to recommend options for waste disposal , is due to report in 2006 they say nuclear energy is economic only under a very restricted analysis - by the time you have factored in the costs of construction , insurance , waste disposal and decommissioning , you need huge subsidies .
and , opponents ask , what happens to the waste ?
the only answer we have come up with so far entails storing the most radioactive waste under guard for millennia , until it has decayed to safe levels .
certainly nuclear power would provide energy to a centralised supply system .
but it would do nothing directly to reduce co2 from transport , unless it made the advent of the hydrogen economy likelier .
also , given the long planning and construction lead times , it would be a good decade or so before we saw any new power stations , even if we decided to go ahead today .
i once heard from a british environment secretary , chris -lrb- now lord -rrb- patten , a telling definition of the problem .
" nuclear power ?
to most people , it 's witchcraft , " he told his hearers .
have your say : are more reactors needed ?
most of us worry far more about something that we see as very unlikely but grotesquely horrible than we do about what we perceive as far likelier but much more mundane .
we have a horror of dying in an air crash , but not of driving to the airport along far more dangerous roads .
we fear radioactive death , but cock an insouciant snook at the risk of dying painfully from the effects of smoking , or obesity , or alcohol .
to that degree , our distrust of nuclear energy may be partly irrational .
in other ways , though , it makes very good sense .
consumer demand getting rid of civil reactors would not remove the risk of a nuclear war breaking out , but it would reduce it .
beyond that , in the past , the nuclear industry -lrb- at least in the uk -rrb- has at times been cavalier with the truth .
one conservative minister said 15 years ago : " it is depressing to stand up in the house of commons and broadcast explicit assurances from our nuclear ' experts ' one day , only to find them discredited the next . "
many environmental groups remain hotly opposed to nuclear power a veteran of the nuclear industry wrote this : " what the industry needs to regain the support of the british public is ... something akin to a truth and reconciliation commission .
" it needs to be admitted that governments and industry lied to the public about the links with the military programme " -lrb- nuclear europe worldscan , 1998 -rrb- .
the signs are that the captains of today 's industry are different and far more open .
but the distrust persists .
two sets of figures crystallise the dilemma .
the uk 's nuclear power stations produce about 20 % of the country 's electricity , and by 2023 all are due to have closed .
but by 2030 it is estimated world co2 emissions will be 62 % higher than today , as global demand for energy grows .
by mid-century we could be on the verge of producing power from nuclear fusion , a radically different technology .
getting from here to there is the tricky bit .
we are understandably terrified of nuclear meltdown , but far fewer of us yet fear the prospect of planetary overheating as we should .

refco , a leading commodities and futures broker , has been in crisis since it revealed it was owed $ 430m -lrb- £ 243m -rrb- by an unregulated subsidiary .
these facts were not disclosed at the time of refco 's flotation in august .
former boss phillip bennett has been charged with fraud and refco shares were suspended after falling 70 % .
potential suitors the scandal is threatening the future of refco , one of wall street 's largest traders of futures and options , used by companies to hedge their exposure to fluctuating prices .
refco bosses met advisers on sunday to discuss their options - thought to centre on salvaging the company 's futures and commodities unit .
man group and jc flowers have emerged as possible buyers of the operation , the wall street journal reported .
however , man group - one of the world 's leading hedge fund operators - said on monday that it was not currently in talks with refco about acquiring any of its businesses . "
the securities and exchange commission should never have let this dog out of the cage " melvyn weiss , milburg weiss according to reuters , refco is considering seeking bankruptcy protection for a number of unregulated businesses which have stopped trading since mr bennett was arrested .
the british-born executive was charged with securities fraud last wednesday and , if found guilty , could face up to 20 years in jail .
he is accused of hiding the fact that refco capital markets - an unregulated subsidiary he controlled - owed $ 430m to its parent company through a series of undisclosed transactions .
the $ 430m has since been repaid , but the firm said its annual accounts since 2002 could not be relied upon .
refco , which has 2,400 employees , is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission , the us financial markets regulator .
refco insisted last week that it had adequate funds to continue trading but credit experts have cast doubt on its future .
lawsuits expected the case could now trigger a host of lawsuits from investors in the firm , which listed on the stock market in august .
" in this case it is pretty much open and shut , " melvyn weiss , from law firm milberg weiss - which has registered to represent shareholders in a class action lawsuit - told the bbc .
investor could have lost up to $ 1bn , mr weiss claimed .
" it is quite obvious in this situation that the financial statements and historic performance of the company were overstated and misleading , " he said .
the case highlighted the need for far tougher scrutiny of firms ' accounts before they join the stock market , he added .
" this is a clarion call for even stricter oversight .
the sec should never have let this dog out of the cage . "

however , in the 19th century , china lagged behind in scientific revolution and subsequently became the victim of invasion by world powers .
the painful recent history of china rouses the sense of responsibility of chinese people to build up a developed and advanced nation .
after dozens of years ' efforts by chinese people , the world has witnessed the waking-up of the sleeping dragon .
the manned space project is a symbol of these efforts .
it shows china 's capacity to develop cutting-edge technologies .
it shows chinese people 's intelligence and diligence .
the success of this project will undoubtedly encourage chinese people to study harder , work harder and research harder to make more and more miracles .
looking into the future , i expect the coming of another greater success - chinese landing on the moon .

meet the panel name : nick xiao age : 28 lives : beijing works : banking professional click here to meet the other panellists but under this chorus of cheers , you can see people interpreting this event quite differently .
some are talking of a third mission , a space station coming soon , a moon landing in the next decade - awesome .
others are watching the astronauts eating , sleeping , yawning and frowning with cultish devotion .
after too much of david beckham or britney spears , that 's something cool for a change .
meanwhile , many relish saying how they think other countries are reacting to this chinese outer space encore - an uneasy us , a sullen japan , a frightened india , an envious eu - but a russia regretting its path over the past 15 years .
well , a bit overdone i suppose .
for me , this mission does n't change , but definitely confirms , my view of china today - muscular , ambitious , yearning to wow others .
what can change my views of china and its place in the world then ?
a better distribution of the country 's growing wealth ; a more transparent government ; a higher quality of life ; and no more reports of my countrymen starved of oxygen in a container under the english channel .
these are down to earth for sure , but so is the landing capsule .
