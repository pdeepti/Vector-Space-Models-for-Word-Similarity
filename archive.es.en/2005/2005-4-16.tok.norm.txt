bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel germany 's finance minister hans eichel said the global economic situation looked worse than " half a year ago . "
but despite its diplomatic and financial clout , the g7 is essentially powerless to influence energy markets , economists say , especially at a time when the organization of petroleum exporting countries has little spare capacity and as non-opec producers are pumping at near maximum levels .
france has been urging energy conservation and diversity but has so far failed to win much support for the initiative within the g7 .
a senior french official , asking not to be named , has said the idea has found little favor in the united states and canada .
" national interests are blocking what we see to be the general interest , " he said .
" i doubt there will be as ambitious an accord -lrb- on oil -rrb- as we would like . "
us chides europe the official also bristled at suggestions by us finance chiefs that washington 's huge current account deficit , a broad measure of foreign trade , is attributable to sluggish growth in europe and japan that prevents consumers there from buying us products .
the current account shortfall unnerves us trading partners , as well as the leadership of the international monetary fund , because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow asked by a cnbc television interviewer about europe and japan , us treasury secretary john snow replied this week : " they clearly need to grow faster .
" they need to get rid of impediments and obstacles to growth ...
our economy is growing well , four percent for the last two years , over double the growth rate of our trading partners .
we are creating a lot of disposable income and we are using it buy goods from our partners .
they have to grow faster .
that 's absolutely certain and that will be my principal message to my g7 colleagues when we meet . "
european irritation european finance leaders , to their great irritation , have had to endure such lectures before and the french official , speaking before snow 's comments were aired , took issue with the argument .
" it does n't stand up very well , " he said .
" if europe were germany it would be right .
but europe is not germany , it 's also france , which has a deficit in its balance of payments and strong domestic demand .
this dissatisfaction has been expressed at the imf where directors , including those from france and italy , complained that the focus on europe obscured the need for the us to reduce its consumption and for japan to boost its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an interview , jeroen kremers , the dutch imf director , who represents 12 countries including the netherlands , said : " structural reform in europe would increase growth , and that would be good .
but would it help to reduce global external imbalances ?
that 's not so clear .
" global external imbalances are caused by the us and asia , not by europe , " he said .
" involving europe in the call for action to correct external imbalances confuses the issue and has provided an excuse for inaction in the us . "
snow is likely to be told that while europe may need to make its economies more competitive and market-friendly , the united states is under an obligation to encourage consumer savings rather spending - particularly on imported items - in order to reduce its trade deficit and rid the world economy of dangerous imbalances .
debt relief disagreements are also dogging g7 efforts to forge a consensus on easing debt burdens on developing countries that owe an estimated 80 billion dollars to multilateral bodies such as the world bank and the imf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in washington under a british proposal the imf would sell some of its gold reserves , which have a market value of about 45 billion dollars , to help it finance debt relief .
in addition to britain , the idea has the backing of france and germany but faces resistance from the united states .
france however is throwing most of its weight behind its call for an international tax on air travel to finance development assistance .
treasury sources in paris have said french finance minister thierry breton would probably argue for some form of international tax at talks here this weekend .
the united states is meanwhile promoting its own initiatives to ease debt burdens and poverty , notably the transformation of world bank loans into grants and president george bush 's millennium challenge account , which ties assistance to good governance , anti-graft measures and transparency in beneficiary countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2005 foreign priests fill european shortages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more priests wanted millions flooded rome last week to honor the late pope john paul ii .
even so , all is not well with the catholic church , which has faced a decline in membership and a shortage of priests in recent years . it ’ s early saturday evening and bells from the monastery and the baroque church are calling people to mass in the sleepy alpine village of disentis .
for a quarter of an hour , the peals drown out every other sound in the village , yet few heed their call . only a few dozen mostly elderly people attend the service .
and because swiss priests are also a rare commodity , the mass is led by a foreigner , a priest from the southern indian state of kerala . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smaller flock benny varghese is one of many foreign shepherds in western europe , tending to an ever smaller flock .
he gives his sermon in the local language , romansh , but it has been prepared for him , since varghese does not yet speak the language , having only been in switzerland for four months .
when talking to locals , he uses his limited knowledge of german , which is also spoken here .

some say the world has been turned upside down , since it used to be europe that sent missionaries out into the world . no real difference varghese says that theologically or spiritually , there is no difference . " the message is the same , but the customs and practices , the way we do it , some differences are there because i come from another tradition , ” he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2005 foreign priests fill european shortages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more priests wanted millions flooded rome last week to honor the late pope john paul ii .
even so , all is not well with the catholic church , which has faced a decline in membership and a shortage of priests in recent years . it ’ s early saturday evening and bells from the monastery and the baroque church are calling people to mass in the sleepy alpine village of disentis .
for a quarter of an hour , the peals drown out every other sound in the village , yet few heed their call . only a few dozen mostly elderly people attend the service .
and because swiss priests are also a rare commodity , the mass is led by a foreigner , a priest from the southern indian state of kerala . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smaller flock benny varghese is one of many foreign shepherds in western europe , tending to an ever smaller flock .
he gives his sermon in the local language , romansh , but it has been prepared for him , since varghese does not yet speak the language , having only been in switzerland for four months .
when talking to locals , he uses his limited knowledge of german , which is also spoken here .
varghese ’ s broad smile widens further when asked if he sees himself as a missionary . “ we are missionaries in the sense that we have a special mission , " he said .
" about 300-400 years ago , many european missionaries came to india and to our place , kerala , and worked hard and now i think it ’ s the duty of every christian to work anywhere in the world for the church of christ . ” varghese says priests from his home diocese are spreading the word of god in the four corners of the globe , particularly in the west where an acute shortage of priests is symptomatic of sharply declining interest in the catholic and protestant churches as institutions . “ as you know , in switzerland like other european countries , the church is facing a difficult situation of lack of priests , " he said .
" it ’ s an understanding between the bishop of chur here and my bishop in kerala , and my bishop requested me to come over to switzerland to do my ministry here . ” some sceptical , others welcoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the two largest swiss bishoprics , chur and basel , there are only enough priests for about half of the parishes and every second cleric is a foreigner - having been brought in from india , africa , south america and eastern europe .
they have to learn new languages , adapt to different customs and traditions and - in varghese ’ s case - an unfamiliar , cold climate .
yet the congregation in disentis has already warmed to him , even though foreigners of a different skin color in positions of authority are few and far between in these parts . one parishioner says people are sceptical when a new priest arrives , but adds varghese and a nigerian priest who has also come to the region to preach , are both very charismatic .
he ’ s thrilled varghese is already leading mass in romansh . another churchgoer , an elderly woman , describes varghese as fantastic but says that people should pray for more swiss men to go into the priesthood . other churchgoers wonder if the church itself is the problem , by not allowing priests to marry or lay persons to lead mass .
some say the world has been turned upside down , since it used to be europe that sent missionaries out into the world . no real difference varghese says that theologically or spiritually , there is no difference . " the message is the same , but the customs and practices , the way we do it , some differences are there because i come from another tradition , ” he says . " i would like to work in even more countries , i love it because we can come to know more people and different customs , lifestyle and everything .
that 's something wonderful . ” roland reamann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a pope of unity but also division while millions of people , not only roman catholics , mourned for pope john paul ii , many regarded his influential views as out-of-date and damaging in the modern world .

arnold schwarzenegger may have banned foie gras in california , but judging from the enthusiasm for it in france , it ’ s unlikely that anyone will try to take away france ’ s traditional holiday feast . gascony , in the southwest of france , is foie gras country .
at claude st. blancard ’ s farm , foie gras is a family affair .
he and his wife and three daughters raise and slaughter 3,000 ducks a year .
while they sell gastronomic food products using the entire bird , foie gras is their specialty . " in our region , it 's the finest delicacy , " st. blancard said .
" it has an unctuous texture and it fills your palate .
foie gras makes a meal special and it 's a symbol of celebration - of christmas and new years , marriages and baptisms .
in gascony , where we celebrate around the dinner table , foie gras is always invited . " in the noisy slaughter room of the farm next door , one of st. blancard ’ s neighbors , patricia thomaselli , prepares foie gras for the tables of popular parisian restaurants .
she kills the birds , bleeds them , removes their feathers , washes them and cuts them open to remove their foie gras .
after removing the intestines and the gizzard , thomaselli lifts out an enormous , tan colored foie gras that seemed to have filled the entire belly of the bird . a distinctly french delicacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jorge vargas uses a funneled pipe to force-feed a measured dose of corn mush to a moulard duck in its pen at sonoma foie gras in california while hungary , israel and a few places in california and new york make foie gras , france produces and consumes 90 percent of the delicacy .
a traditional holiday image in france is the happy , beret-wearing farmer herding his flock of ducks and geese .
but making foie gras requires that geese and ducks be force-fed and kept immobile for the last days of their lives , until their livers become swollen and fat . foie gras has become controversial in places such as california , where its production will be banned starting in 2012 .
and even in france , a growing number of people are questioning the methods used in this billion-dollar industry . one animal rights group has made a film of what it calls the horrors of the force-feeding room and is trying to educate the french public about what the geese and ducks go through to produce foie gras .
dominique hoffpower is a member of the group . " they are kept in individual cages for about 10 days , " said hoffpower .
" they are force-fed with a tube , twice a day into their throats , about two pounds of corn per day .
and that makes their liver swell to about eight times its normal size so they ca n't breathe , they do n't sleep anymore and some of them die before the end .
that 's what foie gras is . " born to gorge ? but as he force-fed his ducks , st. blancard , insisted that the animals do not suffer : foie gras was first discovered by the ancient egyptians , he said , adding that making it only exploits the migrating waterfowl ’ s natural ability to gorge themselves and store the excess fat in their livers before long flights . " we do everything for the ducks to be comfortable , " he said .
" they always have clean water and fresh air .
yes , they have to digest intensively , that 's true and we ca n't deny it .
but they 're not sick .
it 's like a sporting challenge for them .
we do not hurt the birds because if they are unwell they can not produce a nice liver . " bildunterschrift : moulard ducks , 5-6 weeks old , gather in a covered pen but st. blancard admited that large , industrial producers may not take as much care with their birds . while animal activists so far have not driven any foie gras producers out of business in france , european union regulations may .
the eu has demanded that the cages widely used by french farmers be replaced by larger ones so that the birds can move freely , for example . for st. blancard , fulfilling the new regulations will set him back 15,400 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- - all for something he says is an attempt to bring more political correctness to the foie gras industry . eleanor beardsley -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vive la baguette !

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel germany 's finance minister hans eichel said the global economic situation looked worse than " half a year ago . "
but despite its diplomatic and financial clout , the g7 is essentially powerless to influence energy markets , economists say , especially at a time when the organization of petroleum exporting countries has little spare capacity and as non-opec producers are pumping at near maximum levels .
france has been urging energy conservation and diversity but has so far failed to win much support for the initiative within the g7 .
a senior french official , asking not to be named , has said the idea has found little favor in the united states and canada .
" national interests are blocking what we see to be the general interest , " he said .
" i doubt there will be as ambitious an accord -lrb- on oil -rrb- as we would like . "
us chides europe the official also bristled at suggestions by us finance chiefs that washington 's huge current account deficit , a broad measure of foreign trade , is attributable to sluggish growth in europe and japan that prevents consumers there from buying us products .
the current account shortfall unnerves us trading partners , as well as the leadership of the international monetary fund , because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow asked by a cnbc television interviewer about europe and japan , us treasury secretary john snow replied this week : " they clearly need to grow faster .
" they need to get rid of impediments and obstacles to growth ...
our economy is growing well , four percent for the last two years , over double the growth rate of our trading partners .
we are creating a lot of disposable income and we are using it buy goods from our partners .
they have to grow faster .
that 's absolutely certain and that will be my principal message to my g7 colleagues when we meet . "
european irritation european finance leaders , to their great irritation , have had to endure such lectures before and the french official , speaking before snow 's comments were aired , took issue with the argument .
" it does n't stand up very well , " he said .
" if europe were germany it would be right .
but europe is not germany , it 's also france , which has a deficit in its balance of payments and strong domestic demand .
this dissatisfaction has been expressed at the imf where directors , including those from france and italy , complained that the focus on europe obscured the need for the us to reduce its consumption and for japan to boost its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an interview , jeroen kremers , the dutch imf director , who represents 12 countries including the netherlands , said : " structural reform in europe would increase growth , and that would be good .
but would it help to reduce global external imbalances ?
that 's not so clear .
" global external imbalances are caused by the us and asia , not by europe , " he said .
" involving europe in the call for action to correct external imbalances confuses the issue and has provided an excuse for inaction in the us . "
snow is likely to be told that while europe may need to make its economies more competitive and market-friendly , the united states is under an obligation to encourage consumer savings rather spending - particularly on imported items - in order to reduce its trade deficit and rid the world economy of dangerous imbalances .
debt relief disagreements are also dogging g7 efforts to forge a consensus on easing debt burdens on developing countries that owe an estimated 80 billion dollars to multilateral bodies such as the world bank and the imf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in washington under a british proposal the imf would sell some of its gold reserves , which have a market value of about 45 billion dollars , to help it finance debt relief .
in addition to britain , the idea has the backing of france and germany but faces resistance from the united states .
france however is throwing most of its weight behind its call for an international tax on air travel to finance development assistance .
treasury sources in paris have said french finance minister thierry breton would probably argue for some form of international tax at talks here this weekend .
the united states is meanwhile promoting its own initiatives to ease debt burdens and poverty , notably the transformation of world bank loans into grants and president george bush 's millennium challenge account , which ties assistance to good governance , anti-graft measures and transparency in beneficiary countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel germany 's finance minister hans eichel said the global economic situation looked worse than " half a year ago . "
but despite its diplomatic and financial clout , the g7 is essentially powerless to influence energy markets , economists say , especially at a time when the organization of petroleum exporting countries has little spare capacity and as non-opec producers are pumping at near maximum levels .
france has been urging energy conservation and diversity but has so far failed to win much support for the initiative within the g7 .
a senior french official , asking not to be named , has said the idea has found little favor in the united states and canada .
" national interests are blocking what we see to be the general interest , " he said .
" i doubt there will be as ambitious an accord -lrb- on oil -rrb- as we would like . "
us chides europe the official also bristled at suggestions by us finance chiefs that washington 's huge current account deficit , a broad measure of foreign trade , is attributable to sluggish growth in europe and japan that prevents consumers there from buying us products .
the current account shortfall unnerves us trading partners , as well as the leadership of the international monetary fund , because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow asked by a cnbc television interviewer about europe and japan , us treasury secretary john snow replied this week : " they clearly need to grow faster .
" they need to get rid of impediments and obstacles to growth ...
our economy is growing well , four percent for the last two years , over double the growth rate of our trading partners .
we are creating a lot of disposable income and we are using it buy goods from our partners .
they have to grow faster .
that 's absolutely certain and that will be my principal message to my g7 colleagues when we meet . "
european irritation european finance leaders , to their great irritation , have had to endure such lectures before and the french official , speaking before snow 's comments were aired , took issue with the argument .
" it does n't stand up very well , " he said .
" if europe were germany it would be right .
but europe is not germany , it 's also france , which has a deficit in its balance of payments and strong domestic demand .
this dissatisfaction has been expressed at the imf where directors , including those from france and italy , complained that the focus on europe obscured the need for the us to reduce its consumption and for japan to boost its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an interview , jeroen kremers , the dutch imf director , who represents 12 countries including the netherlands , said : " structural reform in europe would increase growth , and that would be good .

arnold schwarzenegger may have banned foie gras in california , but judging from the enthusiasm for it in france , it ’ s unlikely that anyone will try to take away france ’ s traditional holiday feast . gascony , in the southwest of france , is foie gras country .
at claude st. blancard ’ s farm , foie gras is a family affair .
he and his wife and three daughters raise and slaughter 3,000 ducks a year .
while they sell gastronomic food products using the entire bird , foie gras is their specialty . " in our region , it 's the finest delicacy , " st. blancard said .
" it has an unctuous texture and it fills your palate .
foie gras makes a meal special and it 's a symbol of celebration - of christmas and new years , marriages and baptisms .
in gascony , where we celebrate around the dinner table , foie gras is always invited . " in the noisy slaughter room of the farm next door , one of st. blancard ’ s neighbors , patricia thomaselli , prepares foie gras for the tables of popular parisian restaurants .
she kills the birds , bleeds them , removes their feathers , washes them and cuts them open to remove their foie gras .

a traditional holiday image in france is the happy , beret-wearing farmer herding his flock of ducks and geese .
but making foie gras requires that geese and ducks be force-fed and kept immobile for the last days of their lives , until their livers become swollen and fat . foie gras has become controversial in places such as california , where its production will be banned starting in 2012 .
and even in france , a growing number of people are questioning the methods used in this billion-dollar industry . one animal rights group has made a film of what it calls the horrors of the force-feeding room and is trying to educate the french public about what the geese and ducks go through to produce foie gras .
dominique hoffpower is a member of the group . " they are kept in individual cages for about 10 days , " said hoffpower .
" they are force-fed with a tube , twice a day into their throats , about two pounds of corn per day .
and that makes their liver swell to about eight times its normal size so they ca n't breathe , they do n't sleep anymore and some of them die before the end .
that 's what foie gras is . " born to gorge ? but as he force-fed his ducks , st. blancard , insisted that the animals do not suffer : foie gras was first discovered by the ancient egyptians , he said , adding that making it only exploits the migrating waterfowl ’ s natural ability to gorge themselves and store the excess fat in their livers before long flights . " we do everything for the ducks to be comfortable , " he said .
" they always have clean water and fresh air .
yes , they have to digest intensively , that 's true and we ca n't deny it .

arnold schwarzenegger may have banned foie gras in california , but judging from the enthusiasm for it in france , it ’ s unlikely that anyone will try to take away france ’ s traditional holiday feast . gascony , in the southwest of france , is foie gras country .
at claude st. blancard ’ s farm , foie gras is a family affair .
he and his wife and three daughters raise and slaughter 3,000 ducks a year .
while they sell gastronomic food products using the entire bird , foie gras is their specialty . " in our region , it 's the finest delicacy , " st. blancard said .
" it has an unctuous texture and it fills your palate .
foie gras makes a meal special and it 's a symbol of celebration - of christmas and new years , marriages and baptisms .
in gascony , where we celebrate around the dinner table , foie gras is always invited . " in the noisy slaughter room of the farm next door , one of st. blancard ’ s neighbors , patricia thomaselli , prepares foie gras for the tables of popular parisian restaurants .
she kills the birds , bleeds them , removes their feathers , washes them and cuts them open to remove their foie gras .
after removing the intestines and the gizzard , thomaselli lifts out an enormous , tan colored foie gras that seemed to have filled the entire belly of the bird . a distinctly french delicacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jorge vargas uses a funneled pipe to force-feed a measured dose of corn mush to a moulard duck in its pen at sonoma foie gras in california while hungary , israel and a few places in california and new york make foie gras , france produces and consumes 90 percent of the delicacy .
a traditional holiday image in france is the happy , beret-wearing farmer herding his flock of ducks and geese .
but making foie gras requires that geese and ducks be force-fed and kept immobile for the last days of their lives , until their livers become swollen and fat . foie gras has become controversial in places such as california , where its production will be banned starting in 2012 .
and even in france , a growing number of people are questioning the methods used in this billion-dollar industry . one animal rights group has made a film of what it calls the horrors of the force-feeding room and is trying to educate the french public about what the geese and ducks go through to produce foie gras .
dominique hoffpower is a member of the group . " they are kept in individual cages for about 10 days , " said hoffpower .
" they are force-fed with a tube , twice a day into their throats , about two pounds of corn per day .
and that makes their liver swell to about eight times its normal size so they ca n't breathe , they do n't sleep anymore and some of them die before the end .
that 's what foie gras is . " born to gorge ? but as he force-fed his ducks , st. blancard , insisted that the animals do not suffer : foie gras was first discovered by the ancient egyptians , he said , adding that making it only exploits the migrating waterfowl ’ s natural ability to gorge themselves and store the excess fat in their livers before long flights . " we do everything for the ducks to be comfortable , " he said .
" they always have clean water and fresh air .
yes , they have to digest intensively , that 's true and we ca n't deny it .
but they 're not sick .
it 's like a sporting challenge for them .
we do not hurt the birds because if they are unwell they can not produce a nice liver . " bildunterschrift : moulard ducks , 5-6 weeks old , gather in a covered pen but st. blancard admited that large , industrial producers may not take as much care with their birds . while animal activists so far have not driven any foie gras producers out of business in france , european union regulations may .
the eu has demanded that the cages widely used by french farmers be replaced by larger ones so that the birds can move freely , for example . for st. blancard , fulfilling the new regulations will set him back 15,400 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- - all for something he says is an attempt to bring more political correctness to the foie gras industry . eleanor beardsley -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vive la baguette !

arnold schwarzenegger may have banned foie gras in california , but judging from the enthusiasm for it in france , it ’ s unlikely that anyone will try to take away france ’ s traditional holiday feast . gascony , in the southwest of france , is foie gras country .
at claude st. blancard ’ s farm , foie gras is a family affair .
he and his wife and three daughters raise and slaughter 3,000 ducks a year .
while they sell gastronomic food products using the entire bird , foie gras is their specialty . " in our region , it 's the finest delicacy , " st. blancard said .
" it has an unctuous texture and it fills your palate .
foie gras makes a meal special and it 's a symbol of celebration - of christmas and new years , marriages and baptisms .
in gascony , where we celebrate around the dinner table , foie gras is always invited . " in the noisy slaughter room of the farm next door , one of st. blancard ’ s neighbors , patricia thomaselli , prepares foie gras for the tables of popular parisian restaurants .
she kills the birds , bleeds them , removes their feathers , washes them and cuts them open to remove their foie gras .
after removing the intestines and the gizzard , thomaselli lifts out an enormous , tan colored foie gras that seemed to have filled the entire belly of the bird . a distinctly french delicacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jorge vargas uses a funneled pipe to force-feed a measured dose of corn mush to a moulard duck in its pen at sonoma foie gras in california while hungary , israel and a few places in california and new york make foie gras , france produces and consumes 90 percent of the delicacy .
a traditional holiday image in france is the happy , beret-wearing farmer herding his flock of ducks and geese .
but making foie gras requires that geese and ducks be force-fed and kept immobile for the last days of their lives , until their livers become swollen and fat . foie gras has become controversial in places such as california , where its production will be banned starting in 2012 .
and even in france , a growing number of people are questioning the methods used in this billion-dollar industry . one animal rights group has made a film of what it calls the horrors of the force-feeding room and is trying to educate the french public about what the geese and ducks go through to produce foie gras .
dominique hoffpower is a member of the group . " they are kept in individual cages for about 10 days , " said hoffpower .
" they are force-fed with a tube , twice a day into their throats , about two pounds of corn per day .
and that makes their liver swell to about eight times its normal size so they ca n't breathe , they do n't sleep anymore and some of them die before the end .
that 's what foie gras is . " born to gorge ? but as he force-fed his ducks , st. blancard , insisted that the animals do not suffer : foie gras was first discovered by the ancient egyptians , he said , adding that making it only exploits the migrating waterfowl ’ s natural ability to gorge themselves and store the excess fat in their livers before long flights . " we do everything for the ducks to be comfortable , " he said .
" they always have clean water and fresh air .
yes , they have to digest intensively , that 's true and we ca n't deny it .
but they 're not sick .
it 's like a sporting challenge for them .
we do not hurt the birds because if they are unwell they can not produce a nice liver . " bildunterschrift : moulard ducks , 5-6 weeks old , gather in a covered pen but st. blancard admited that large , industrial producers may not take as much care with their birds . while animal activists so far have not driven any foie gras producers out of business in france , european union regulations may .
the eu has demanded that the cages widely used by french farmers be replaced by larger ones so that the birds can move freely , for example . for st. blancard , fulfilling the new regulations will set him back 15,400 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- - all for something he says is an attempt to bring more political correctness to the foie gras industry . eleanor beardsley -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vive la baguette !

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel germany 's finance minister hans eichel said the global economic situation looked worse than " half a year ago . "
but despite its diplomatic and financial clout , the g7 is essentially powerless to influence energy markets , economists say , especially at a time when the organization of petroleum exporting countries has little spare capacity and as non-opec producers are pumping at near maximum levels .
france has been urging energy conservation and diversity but has so far failed to win much support for the initiative within the g7 .
a senior french official , asking not to be named , has said the idea has found little favor in the united states and canada .
" national interests are blocking what we see to be the general interest , " he said .
" i doubt there will be as ambitious an accord -lrb- on oil -rrb- as we would like . "
us chides europe the official also bristled at suggestions by us finance chiefs that washington 's huge current account deficit , a broad measure of foreign trade , is attributable to sluggish growth in europe and japan that prevents consumers there from buying us products .
the current account shortfall unnerves us trading partners , as well as the leadership of the international monetary fund , because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow asked by a cnbc television interviewer about europe and japan , us treasury secretary john snow replied this week : " they clearly need to grow faster .
" they need to get rid of impediments and obstacles to growth ...
our economy is growing well , four percent for the last two years , over double the growth rate of our trading partners .
we are creating a lot of disposable income and we are using it buy goods from our partners .
they have to grow faster .
that 's absolutely certain and that will be my principal message to my g7 colleagues when we meet . "
european irritation european finance leaders , to their great irritation , have had to endure such lectures before and the french official , speaking before snow 's comments were aired , took issue with the argument .
" it does n't stand up very well , " he said .
" if europe were germany it would be right .
but europe is not germany , it 's also france , which has a deficit in its balance of payments and strong domestic demand .
this dissatisfaction has been expressed at the imf where directors , including those from france and italy , complained that the focus on europe obscured the need for the us to reduce its consumption and for japan to boost its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an interview , jeroen kremers , the dutch imf director , who represents 12 countries including the netherlands , said : " structural reform in europe would increase growth , and that would be good .
but would it help to reduce global external imbalances ?
that 's not so clear .
" global external imbalances are caused by the us and asia , not by europe , " he said .
" involving europe in the call for action to correct external imbalances confuses the issue and has provided an excuse for inaction in the us . "
snow is likely to be told that while europe may need to make its economies more competitive and market-friendly , the united states is under an obligation to encourage consumer savings rather spending - particularly on imported items - in order to reduce its trade deficit and rid the world economy of dangerous imbalances .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel germany 's finance minister hans eichel said the global economic situation looked worse than " half a year ago . "
but despite its diplomatic and financial clout , the g7 is essentially powerless to influence energy markets , economists say , especially at a time when the organization of petroleum exporting countries has little spare capacity and as non-opec producers are pumping at near maximum levels .
france has been urging energy conservation and diversity but has so far failed to win much support for the initiative within the g7 .
a senior french official , asking not to be named , has said the idea has found little favor in the united states and canada .
" national interests are blocking what we see to be the general interest , " he said .
" i doubt there will be as ambitious an accord -lrb- on oil -rrb- as we would like . "
us chides europe the official also bristled at suggestions by us finance chiefs that washington 's huge current account deficit , a broad measure of foreign trade , is attributable to sluggish growth in europe and japan that prevents consumers there from buying us products .
the current account shortfall unnerves us trading partners , as well as the leadership of the international monetary fund , because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow asked by a cnbc television interviewer about europe and japan , us treasury secretary john snow replied this week : " they clearly need to grow faster .
" they need to get rid of impediments and obstacles to growth ...
our economy is growing well , four percent for the last two years , over double the growth rate of our trading partners .
we are creating a lot of disposable income and we are using it buy goods from our partners .
they have to grow faster .
that 's absolutely certain and that will be my principal message to my g7 colleagues when we meet . "
european irritation european finance leaders , to their great irritation , have had to endure such lectures before and the french official , speaking before snow 's comments were aired , took issue with the argument .
" it does n't stand up very well , " he said .
" if europe were germany it would be right .
but europe is not germany , it 's also france , which has a deficit in its balance of payments and strong domestic demand .
this dissatisfaction has been expressed at the imf where directors , including those from france and italy , complained that the focus on europe obscured the need for the us to reduce its consumption and for japan to boost its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an interview , jeroen kremers , the dutch imf director , who represents 12 countries including the netherlands , said : " structural reform in europe would increase growth , and that would be good .
but would it help to reduce global external imbalances ?
that 's not so clear .
" global external imbalances are caused by the us and asia , not by europe , " he said .
" involving europe in the call for action to correct external imbalances confuses the issue and has provided an excuse for inaction in the us . "
snow is likely to be told that while europe may need to make its economies more competitive and market-friendly , the united states is under an obligation to encourage consumer savings rather spending - particularly on imported items - in order to reduce its trade deficit and rid the world economy of dangerous imbalances .
debt relief disagreements are also dogging g7 efforts to forge a consensus on easing debt burdens on developing countries that owe an estimated 80 billion dollars to multilateral bodies such as the world bank and the imf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in washington under a british proposal the imf would sell some of its gold reserves , which have a market value of about 45 billion dollars , to help it finance debt relief .
in addition to britain , the idea has the backing of france and germany but faces resistance from the united states .
france however is throwing most of its weight behind its call for an international tax on air travel to finance development assistance .
treasury sources in paris have said french finance minister thierry breton would probably argue for some form of international tax at talks here this weekend .
the united states is meanwhile promoting its own initiatives to ease debt burdens and poverty , notably the transformation of world bank loans into grants and president george bush 's millennium challenge account , which ties assistance to good governance , anti-graft measures and transparency in beneficiary countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel germany 's finance minister hans eichel said the global economic situation looked worse than " half a year ago . "
but despite its diplomatic and financial clout , the g7 is essentially powerless to influence energy markets , economists say , especially at a time when the organization of petroleum exporting countries has little spare capacity and as non-opec producers are pumping at near maximum levels .
france has been urging energy conservation and diversity but has so far failed to win much support for the initiative within the g7 .
a senior french official , asking not to be named , has said the idea has found little favor in the united states and canada .
" national interests are blocking what we see to be the general interest , " he said .
" i doubt there will be as ambitious an accord -lrb- on oil -rrb- as we would like . "
us chides europe the official also bristled at suggestions by us finance chiefs that washington 's huge current account deficit , a broad measure of foreign trade , is attributable to sluggish growth in europe and japan that prevents consumers there from buying us products .
the current account shortfall unnerves us trading partners , as well as the leadership of the international monetary fund , because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow asked by a cnbc television interviewer about europe and japan , us treasury secretary john snow replied this week : " they clearly need to grow faster .
" they need to get rid of impediments and obstacles to growth ...
our economy is growing well , four percent for the last two years , over double the growth rate of our trading partners .
we are creating a lot of disposable income and we are using it buy goods from our partners .
they have to grow faster .
that 's absolutely certain and that will be my principal message to my g7 colleagues when we meet . "
european irritation european finance leaders , to their great irritation , have had to endure such lectures before and the french official , speaking before snow 's comments were aired , took issue with the argument .
" it does n't stand up very well , " he said .
" if europe were germany it would be right .
but europe is not germany , it 's also france , which has a deficit in its balance of payments and strong domestic demand .
this dissatisfaction has been expressed at the imf where directors , including those from france and italy , complained that the focus on europe obscured the need for the us to reduce its consumption and for japan to boost its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an interview , jeroen kremers , the dutch imf director , who represents 12 countries including the netherlands , said : " structural reform in europe would increase growth , and that would be good .
but would it help to reduce global external imbalances ?
that 's not so clear .
" global external imbalances are caused by the us and asia , not by europe , " he said .
" involving europe in the call for action to correct external imbalances confuses the issue and has provided an excuse for inaction in the us . "
snow is likely to be told that while europe may need to make its economies more competitive and market-friendly , the united states is under an obligation to encourage consumer savings rather spending - particularly on imported items - in order to reduce its trade deficit and rid the world economy of dangerous imbalances .
debt relief disagreements are also dogging g7 efforts to forge a consensus on easing debt burdens on developing countries that owe an estimated 80 billion dollars to multilateral bodies such as the world bank and the imf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in washington under a british proposal the imf would sell some of its gold reserves , which have a market value of about 45 billion dollars , to help it finance debt relief .
in addition to britain , the idea has the backing of france and germany but faces resistance from the united states .
france however is throwing most of its weight behind its call for an international tax on air travel to finance development assistance .
treasury sources in paris have said french finance minister thierry breton would probably argue for some form of international tax at talks here this weekend .
the united states is meanwhile promoting its own initiatives to ease debt burdens and poverty , notably the transformation of world bank loans into grants and president george bush 's millennium challenge account , which ties assistance to good governance , anti-graft measures and transparency in beneficiary countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

arnold schwarzenegger may have banned foie gras in california , but judging from the enthusiasm for it in france , it ’ s unlikely that anyone will try to take away france ’ s traditional holiday feast . gascony , in the southwest of france , is foie gras country .
at claude st. blancard ’ s farm , foie gras is a family affair .
he and his wife and three daughters raise and slaughter 3,000 ducks a year .
while they sell gastronomic food products using the entire bird , foie gras is their specialty . " in our region , it 's the finest delicacy , " st. blancard said .
" it has an unctuous texture and it fills your palate .
foie gras makes a meal special and it 's a symbol of celebration - of christmas and new years , marriages and baptisms .
in gascony , where we celebrate around the dinner table , foie gras is always invited . " in the noisy slaughter room of the farm next door , one of st. blancard ’ s neighbors , patricia thomaselli , prepares foie gras for the tables of popular parisian restaurants .
she kills the birds , bleeds them , removes their feathers , washes them and cuts them open to remove their foie gras .
after removing the intestines and the gizzard , thomaselli lifts out an enormous , tan colored foie gras that seemed to have filled the entire belly of the bird . a distinctly french delicacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jorge vargas uses a funneled pipe to force-feed a measured dose of corn mush to a moulard duck in its pen at sonoma foie gras in california while hungary , israel and a few places in california and new york make foie gras , france produces and consumes 90 percent of the delicacy .
a traditional holiday image in france is the happy , beret-wearing farmer herding his flock of ducks and geese .
but making foie gras requires that geese and ducks be force-fed and kept immobile for the last days of their lives , until their livers become swollen and fat . foie gras has become controversial in places such as california , where its production will be banned starting in 2012 .
and even in france , a growing number of people are questioning the methods used in this billion-dollar industry . one animal rights group has made a film of what it calls the horrors of the force-feeding room and is trying to educate the french public about what the geese and ducks go through to produce foie gras .
dominique hoffpower is a member of the group . " they are kept in individual cages for about 10 days , " said hoffpower .
" they are force-fed with a tube , twice a day into their throats , about two pounds of corn per day .
and that makes their liver swell to about eight times its normal size so they ca n't breathe , they do n't sleep anymore and some of them die before the end .
that 's what foie gras is . " born to gorge ? but as he force-fed his ducks , st. blancard , insisted that the animals do not suffer : foie gras was first discovered by the ancient egyptians , he said , adding that making it only exploits the migrating waterfowl ’ s natural ability to gorge themselves and store the excess fat in their livers before long flights . " we do everything for the ducks to be comfortable , " he said .
" they always have clean water and fresh air .
yes , they have to digest intensively , that 's true and we ca n't deny it .
but they 're not sick .
it 's like a sporting challenge for them .
we do not hurt the birds because if they are unwell they can not produce a nice liver . " bildunterschrift : moulard ducks , 5-6 weeks old , gather in a covered pen but st. blancard admited that large , industrial producers may not take as much care with their birds . while animal activists so far have not driven any foie gras producers out of business in france , european union regulations may .

arnold schwarzenegger may have banned foie gras in california , but judging from the enthusiasm for it in france , it ’ s unlikely that anyone will try to take away france ’ s traditional holiday feast . gascony , in the southwest of france , is foie gras country .
at claude st. blancard ’ s farm , foie gras is a family affair .
he and his wife and three daughters raise and slaughter 3,000 ducks a year .
while they sell gastronomic food products using the entire bird , foie gras is their specialty . " in our region , it 's the finest delicacy , " st. blancard said .
" it has an unctuous texture and it fills your palate .
foie gras makes a meal special and it 's a symbol of celebration - of christmas and new years , marriages and baptisms .
in gascony , where we celebrate around the dinner table , foie gras is always invited . " in the noisy slaughter room of the farm next door , one of st. blancard ’ s neighbors , patricia thomaselli , prepares foie gras for the tables of popular parisian restaurants .
she kills the birds , bleeds them , removes their feathers , washes them and cuts them open to remove their foie gras .
after removing the intestines and the gizzard , thomaselli lifts out an enormous , tan colored foie gras that seemed to have filled the entire belly of the bird . a distinctly french delicacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jorge vargas uses a funneled pipe to force-feed a measured dose of corn mush to a moulard duck in its pen at sonoma foie gras in california while hungary , israel and a few places in california and new york make foie gras , france produces and consumes 90 percent of the delicacy .
a traditional holiday image in france is the happy , beret-wearing farmer herding his flock of ducks and geese .
but making foie gras requires that geese and ducks be force-fed and kept immobile for the last days of their lives , until their livers become swollen and fat . foie gras has become controversial in places such as california , where its production will be banned starting in 2012 .
and even in france , a growing number of people are questioning the methods used in this billion-dollar industry . one animal rights group has made a film of what it calls the horrors of the force-feeding room and is trying to educate the french public about what the geese and ducks go through to produce foie gras .
dominique hoffpower is a member of the group . " they are kept in individual cages for about 10 days , " said hoffpower .
" they are force-fed with a tube , twice a day into their throats , about two pounds of corn per day .
and that makes their liver swell to about eight times its normal size so they ca n't breathe , they do n't sleep anymore and some of them die before the end .
that 's what foie gras is . " born to gorge ? but as he force-fed his ducks , st. blancard , insisted that the animals do not suffer : foie gras was first discovered by the ancient egyptians , he said , adding that making it only exploits the migrating waterfowl ’ s natural ability to gorge themselves and store the excess fat in their livers before long flights . " we do everything for the ducks to be comfortable , " he said .
" they always have clean water and fresh air .
yes , they have to digest intensively , that 's true and we ca n't deny it .
but they 're not sick .
it 's like a sporting challenge for them .
we do not hurt the birds because if they are unwell they can not produce a nice liver . " bildunterschrift : moulard ducks , 5-6 weeks old , gather in a covered pen but st. blancard admited that large , industrial producers may not take as much care with their birds . while animal activists so far have not driven any foie gras producers out of business in france , european union regulations may .
the eu has demanded that the cages widely used by french farmers be replaced by larger ones so that the birds can move freely , for example . for st. blancard , fulfilling the new regulations will set him back 15,400 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- - all for something he says is an attempt to bring more political correctness to the foie gras industry . eleanor beardsley -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vive la baguette !

even so , all is not well with the catholic church , which has faced a decline in membership and a shortage of priests in recent years . it ’ s early saturday evening and bells from the monastery and the baroque church are calling people to mass in the sleepy alpine village of disentis .
for a quarter of an hour , the peals drown out every other sound in the village , yet few heed their call . only a few dozen mostly elderly people attend the service .
and because swiss priests are also a rare commodity , the mass is led by a foreigner , a priest from the southern indian state of kerala . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smaller flock benny varghese is one of many foreign shepherds in western europe , tending to an ever smaller flock .
he gives his sermon in the local language , romansh , but it has been prepared for him , since varghese does not yet speak the language , having only been in switzerland for four months .
when talking to locals , he uses his limited knowledge of german , which is also spoken here .
varghese ’ s broad smile widens further when asked if he sees himself as a missionary . “ we are missionaries in the sense that we have a special mission , " he said .
" about 300-400 years ago , many european missionaries came to india and to our place , kerala , and worked hard and now i think it ’ s the duty of every christian to work anywhere in the world for the church of christ . ” varghese says priests from his home diocese are spreading the word of god in the four corners of the globe , particularly in the west where an acute shortage of priests is symptomatic of sharply declining interest in the catholic and protestant churches as institutions . “ as you know , in switzerland like other european countries , the church is facing a difficult situation of lack of priests , " he said .
" it ’ s an understanding between the bishop of chur here and my bishop in kerala , and my bishop requested me to come over to switzerland to do my ministry here . ” some sceptical , others welcoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the two largest swiss bishoprics , chur and basel , there are only enough priests for about half of the parishes and every second cleric is a foreigner - having been brought in from india , africa , south america and eastern europe .
they have to learn new languages , adapt to different customs and traditions and - in varghese ’ s case - an unfamiliar , cold climate .
yet the congregation in disentis has already warmed to him , even though foreigners of a different skin color in positions of authority are few and far between in these parts . one parishioner says people are sceptical when a new priest arrives , but adds varghese and a nigerian priest who has also come to the region to preach , are both very charismatic .
he ’ s thrilled varghese is already leading mass in romansh . another churchgoer , an elderly woman , describes varghese as fantastic but says that people should pray for more swiss men to go into the priesthood . other churchgoers wonder if the church itself is the problem , by not allowing priests to marry or lay persons to lead mass .
some say the world has been turned upside down , since it used to be europe that sent missionaries out into the world . no real difference varghese says that theologically or spiritually , there is no difference . " the message is the same , but the customs and practices , the way we do it , some differences are there because i come from another tradition , ” he says . " i would like to work in even more countries , i love it because we can come to know more people and different customs , lifestyle and everything .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2005 foreign priests fill european shortages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more priests wanted millions flooded rome last week to honor the late pope john paul ii .
even so , all is not well with the catholic church , which has faced a decline in membership and a shortage of priests in recent years . it ’ s early saturday evening and bells from the monastery and the baroque church are calling people to mass in the sleepy alpine village of disentis .
for a quarter of an hour , the peals drown out every other sound in the village , yet few heed their call . only a few dozen mostly elderly people attend the service .
and because swiss priests are also a rare commodity , the mass is led by a foreigner , a priest from the southern indian state of kerala . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smaller flock benny varghese is one of many foreign shepherds in western europe , tending to an ever smaller flock .
he gives his sermon in the local language , romansh , but it has been prepared for him , since varghese does not yet speak the language , having only been in switzerland for four months .
when talking to locals , he uses his limited knowledge of german , which is also spoken here .
varghese ’ s broad smile widens further when asked if he sees himself as a missionary . “ we are missionaries in the sense that we have a special mission , " he said .
" about 300-400 years ago , many european missionaries came to india and to our place , kerala , and worked hard and now i think it ’ s the duty of every christian to work anywhere in the world for the church of christ . ” varghese says priests from his home diocese are spreading the word of god in the four corners of the globe , particularly in the west where an acute shortage of priests is symptomatic of sharply declining interest in the catholic and protestant churches as institutions . “ as you know , in switzerland like other european countries , the church is facing a difficult situation of lack of priests , " he said .
" it ’ s an understanding between the bishop of chur here and my bishop in kerala , and my bishop requested me to come over to switzerland to do my ministry here . ” some sceptical , others welcoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the two largest swiss bishoprics , chur and basel , there are only enough priests for about half of the parishes and every second cleric is a foreigner - having been brought in from india , africa , south america and eastern europe .
they have to learn new languages , adapt to different customs and traditions and - in varghese ’ s case - an unfamiliar , cold climate .
yet the congregation in disentis has already warmed to him , even though foreigners of a different skin color in positions of authority are few and far between in these parts . one parishioner says people are sceptical when a new priest arrives , but adds varghese and a nigerian priest who has also come to the region to preach , are both very charismatic .
he ’ s thrilled varghese is already leading mass in romansh . another churchgoer , an elderly woman , describes varghese as fantastic but says that people should pray for more swiss men to go into the priesthood . other churchgoers wonder if the church itself is the problem , by not allowing priests to marry or lay persons to lead mass .
some say the world has been turned upside down , since it used to be europe that sent missionaries out into the world . no real difference varghese says that theologically or spiritually , there is no difference . " the message is the same , but the customs and practices , the way we do it , some differences are there because i come from another tradition , ” he says . " i would like to work in even more countries , i love it because we can come to know more people and different customs , lifestyle and everything .
that 's something wonderful . ” roland reamann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a pope of unity but also division while millions of people , not only roman catholics , mourned for pope john paul ii , many regarded his influential views as out-of-date and damaging in the modern world .
-lrb- april 3 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel germany 's finance minister hans eichel said the global economic situation looked worse than " half a year ago . "
but despite its diplomatic and financial clout , the g7 is essentially powerless to influence energy markets , economists say , especially at a time when the organization of petroleum exporting countries has little spare capacity and as non-opec producers are pumping at near maximum levels .
france has been urging energy conservation and diversity but has so far failed to win much support for the initiative within the g7 .
a senior french official , asking not to be named , has said the idea has found little favor in the united states and canada .
" national interests are blocking what we see to be the general interest , " he said .
" i doubt there will be as ambitious an accord -lrb- on oil -rrb- as we would like . "
us chides europe the official also bristled at suggestions by us finance chiefs that washington 's huge current account deficit , a broad measure of foreign trade , is attributable to sluggish growth in europe and japan that prevents consumers there from buying us products .
the current account shortfall unnerves us trading partners , as well as the leadership of the international monetary fund , because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow asked by a cnbc television interviewer about europe and japan , us treasury secretary john snow replied this week : " they clearly need to grow faster .
" they need to get rid of impediments and obstacles to growth ...
our economy is growing well , four percent for the last two years , over double the growth rate of our trading partners .
we are creating a lot of disposable income and we are using it buy goods from our partners .
they have to grow faster .
that 's absolutely certain and that will be my principal message to my g7 colleagues when we meet . "
european irritation european finance leaders , to their great irritation , have had to endure such lectures before and the french official , speaking before snow 's comments were aired , took issue with the argument .
" it does n't stand up very well , " he said .
" if europe were germany it would be right .
but europe is not germany , it 's also france , which has a deficit in its balance of payments and strong domestic demand .
this dissatisfaction has been expressed at the imf where directors , including those from france and italy , complained that the focus on europe obscured the need for the us to reduce its consumption and for japan to boost its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an interview , jeroen kremers , the dutch imf director , who represents 12 countries including the netherlands , said : " structural reform in europe would increase growth , and that would be good .
but would it help to reduce global external imbalances ?
that 's not so clear .
" global external imbalances are caused by the us and asia , not by europe , " he said .
" involving europe in the call for action to correct external imbalances confuses the issue and has provided an excuse for inaction in the us . "
snow is likely to be told that while europe may need to make its economies more competitive and market-friendly , the united states is under an obligation to encourage consumer savings rather spending - particularly on imported items - in order to reduce its trade deficit and rid the world economy of dangerous imbalances .
debt relief disagreements are also dogging g7 efforts to forge a consensus on easing debt burdens on developing countries that owe an estimated 80 billion dollars to multilateral bodies such as the world bank and the imf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in washington under a british proposal the imf would sell some of its gold reserves , which have a market value of about 45 billion dollars , to help it finance debt relief .
in addition to britain , the idea has the backing of france and germany but faces resistance from the united states .
france however is throwing most of its weight behind its call for an international tax on air travel to finance development assistance .
treasury sources in paris have said french finance minister thierry breton would probably argue for some form of international tax at talks here this weekend .
the united states is meanwhile promoting its own initiatives to ease debt burdens and poverty , notably the transformation of world bank loans into grants and president george bush 's millennium challenge account , which ties assistance to good governance , anti-graft measures and transparency in beneficiary countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel germany 's finance minister hans eichel said the global economic situation looked worse than " half a year ago . "
but despite its diplomatic and financial clout , the g7 is essentially powerless to influence energy markets , economists say , especially at a time when the organization of petroleum exporting countries has little spare capacity and as non-opec producers are pumping at near maximum levels .
france has been urging energy conservation and diversity but has so far failed to win much support for the initiative within the g7 .
a senior french official , asking not to be named , has said the idea has found little favor in the united states and canada .
" national interests are blocking what we see to be the general interest , " he said .
" i doubt there will be as ambitious an accord -lrb- on oil -rrb- as we would like . "
us chides europe the official also bristled at suggestions by us finance chiefs that washington 's huge current account deficit , a broad measure of foreign trade , is attributable to sluggish growth in europe and japan that prevents consumers there from buying us products .
the current account shortfall unnerves us trading partners , as well as the leadership of the international monetary fund , because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us treasury secretary john snow asked by a cnbc television interviewer about europe and japan , us treasury secretary john snow replied this week : " they clearly need to grow faster .
" they need to get rid of impediments and obstacles to growth ...
our economy is growing well , four percent for the last two years , over double the growth rate of our trading partners .
we are creating a lot of disposable income and we are using it buy goods from our partners .
they have to grow faster .
that 's absolutely certain and that will be my principal message to my g7 colleagues when we meet . "
european irritation european finance leaders , to their great irritation , have had to endure such lectures before and the french official , speaking before snow 's comments were aired , took issue with the argument .
" it does n't stand up very well , " he said .
" if europe were germany it would be right .
but europe is not germany , it 's also france , which has a deficit in its balance of payments and strong domestic demand .
this dissatisfaction has been expressed at the imf where directors , including those from france and italy , complained that the focus on europe obscured the need for the us to reduce its consumption and for japan to boost its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an interview , jeroen kremers , the dutch imf director , who represents 12 countries including the netherlands , said : " structural reform in europe would increase growth , and that would be good .
but would it help to reduce global external imbalances ?
that 's not so clear .
" global external imbalances are caused by the us and asia , not by europe , " he said .
" involving europe in the call for action to correct external imbalances confuses the issue and has provided an excuse for inaction in the us . "
snow is likely to be told that while europe may need to make its economies more competitive and market-friendly , the united states is under an obligation to encourage consumer savings rather spending - particularly on imported items - in order to reduce its trade deficit and rid the world economy of dangerous imbalances .
debt relief disagreements are also dogging g7 efforts to forge a consensus on easing debt burdens on developing countries that owe an estimated 80 billion dollars to multilateral bodies such as the world bank and the imf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in washington under a british proposal the imf would sell some of its gold reserves , which have a market value of about 45 billion dollars , to help it finance debt relief .
in addition to britain , the idea has the backing of france and germany but faces resistance from the united states .
france however is throwing most of its weight behind its call for an international tax on air travel to finance development assistance .
treasury sources in paris have said french finance minister thierry breton would probably argue for some form of international tax at talks here this weekend .
the united states is meanwhile promoting its own initiatives to ease debt burdens and poverty , notably the transformation of world bank loans into grants and president george bush 's millennium challenge account , which ties assistance to good governance , anti-graft measures and transparency in beneficiary countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

arnold schwarzenegger may have banned foie gras in california , but judging from the enthusiasm for it in france , it ’ s unlikely that anyone will try to take away france ’ s traditional holiday feast . gascony , in the southwest of france , is foie gras country .
at claude st. blancard ’ s farm , foie gras is a family affair .
he and his wife and three daughters raise and slaughter 3,000 ducks a year .
while they sell gastronomic food products using the entire bird , foie gras is their specialty . " in our region , it 's the finest delicacy , " st. blancard said .
" it has an unctuous texture and it fills your palate .
foie gras makes a meal special and it 's a symbol of celebration - of christmas and new years , marriages and baptisms .
in gascony , where we celebrate around the dinner table , foie gras is always invited . " in the noisy slaughter room of the farm next door , one of st. blancard ’ s neighbors , patricia thomaselli , prepares foie gras for the tables of popular parisian restaurants .
she kills the birds , bleeds them , removes their feathers , washes them and cuts them open to remove their foie gras .
after removing the intestines and the gizzard , thomaselli lifts out an enormous , tan colored foie gras that seemed to have filled the entire belly of the bird . a distinctly french delicacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jorge vargas uses a funneled pipe to force-feed a measured dose of corn mush to a moulard duck in its pen at sonoma foie gras in california while hungary , israel and a few places in california and new york make foie gras , france produces and consumes 90 percent of the delicacy .
a traditional holiday image in france is the happy , beret-wearing farmer herding his flock of ducks and geese .
but making foie gras requires that geese and ducks be force-fed and kept immobile for the last days of their lives , until their livers become swollen and fat . foie gras has become controversial in places such as california , where its production will be banned starting in 2012 .
and even in france , a growing number of people are questioning the methods used in this billion-dollar industry . one animal rights group has made a film of what it calls the horrors of the force-feeding room and is trying to educate the french public about what the geese and ducks go through to produce foie gras .
dominique hoffpower is a member of the group . " they are kept in individual cages for about 10 days , " said hoffpower .
" they are force-fed with a tube , twice a day into their throats , about two pounds of corn per day .
and that makes their liver swell to about eight times its normal size so they ca n't breathe , they do n't sleep anymore and some of them die before the end .
that 's what foie gras is . " born to gorge ? but as he force-fed his ducks , st. blancard , insisted that the animals do not suffer : foie gras was first discovered by the ancient egyptians , he said , adding that making it only exploits the migrating waterfowl ’ s natural ability to gorge themselves and store the excess fat in their livers before long flights . " we do everything for the ducks to be comfortable , " he said .
" they always have clean water and fresh air .
yes , they have to digest intensively , that 's true and we ca n't deny it .
but they 're not sick .
it 's like a sporting challenge for them .
we do not hurt the birds because if they are unwell they can not produce a nice liver . " bildunterschrift : moulard ducks , 5-6 weeks old , gather in a covered pen but st. blancard admited that large , industrial producers may not take as much care with their birds . while animal activists so far have not driven any foie gras producers out of business in france , european union regulations may .
the eu has demanded that the cages widely used by french farmers be replaced by larger ones so that the birds can move freely , for example . for st. blancard , fulfilling the new regulations will set him back 15,400 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- - all for something he says is an attempt to bring more political correctness to the foie gras industry . eleanor beardsley -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vive la baguette !

even so , all is not well with the catholic church , which has faced a decline in membership and a shortage of priests in recent years . it ’ s early saturday evening and bells from the monastery and the baroque church are calling people to mass in the sleepy alpine village of disentis .
for a quarter of an hour , the peals drown out every other sound in the village , yet few heed their call . only a few dozen mostly elderly people attend the service .
and because swiss priests are also a rare commodity , the mass is led by a foreigner , a priest from the southern indian state of kerala . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smaller flock benny varghese is one of many foreign shepherds in western europe , tending to an ever smaller flock .
he gives his sermon in the local language , romansh , but it has been prepared for him , since varghese does not yet speak the language , having only been in switzerland for four months .
when talking to locals , he uses his limited knowledge of german , which is also spoken here .
varghese ’ s broad smile widens further when asked if he sees himself as a missionary . “ we are missionaries in the sense that we have a special mission , " he said .
" about 300-400 years ago , many european missionaries came to india and to our place , kerala , and worked hard and now i think it ’ s the duty of every christian to work anywhere in the world for the church of christ . ” varghese says priests from his home diocese are spreading the word of god in the four corners of the globe , particularly in the west where an acute shortage of priests is symptomatic of sharply declining interest in the catholic and protestant churches as institutions . “ as you know , in switzerland like other european countries , the church is facing a difficult situation of lack of priests , " he said .
" it ’ s an understanding between the bishop of chur here and my bishop in kerala , and my bishop requested me to come over to switzerland to do my ministry here . ” some sceptical , others welcoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the two largest swiss bishoprics , chur and basel , there are only enough priests for about half of the parishes and every second cleric is a foreigner - having been brought in from india , africa , south america and eastern europe .
they have to learn new languages , adapt to different customs and traditions and - in varghese ’ s case - an unfamiliar , cold climate .
yet the congregation in disentis has already warmed to him , even though foreigners of a different skin color in positions of authority are few and far between in these parts . one parishioner says people are sceptical when a new priest arrives , but adds varghese and a nigerian priest who has also come to the region to preach , are both very charismatic .
he ’ s thrilled varghese is already leading mass in romansh . another churchgoer , an elderly woman , describes varghese as fantastic but says that people should pray for more swiss men to go into the priesthood . other churchgoers wonder if the church itself is the problem , by not allowing priests to marry or lay persons to lead mass .
some say the world has been turned upside down , since it used to be europe that sent missionaries out into the world . no real difference varghese says that theologically or spiritually , there is no difference . " the message is the same , but the customs and practices , the way we do it , some differences are there because i come from another tradition , ” he says . " i would like to work in even more countries , i love it because we can come to know more people and different customs , lifestyle and everything .

arnold schwarzenegger may have banned foie gras in california , but judging from the enthusiasm for it in france , it ’ s unlikely that anyone will try to take away france ’ s traditional holiday feast . gascony , in the southwest of france , is foie gras country .
at claude st. blancard ’ s farm , foie gras is a family affair .
he and his wife and three daughters raise and slaughter 3,000 ducks a year .
while they sell gastronomic food products using the entire bird , foie gras is their specialty . " in our region , it 's the finest delicacy , " st. blancard said .
" it has an unctuous texture and it fills your palate .
foie gras makes a meal special and it 's a symbol of celebration - of christmas and new years , marriages and baptisms .
in gascony , where we celebrate around the dinner table , foie gras is always invited . " in the noisy slaughter room of the farm next door , one of st. blancard ’ s neighbors , patricia thomaselli , prepares foie gras for the tables of popular parisian restaurants .
she kills the birds , bleeds them , removes their feathers , washes them and cuts them open to remove their foie gras .
after removing the intestines and the gizzard , thomaselli lifts out an enormous , tan colored foie gras that seemed to have filled the entire belly of the bird . a distinctly french delicacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jorge vargas uses a funneled pipe to force-feed a measured dose of corn mush to a moulard duck in its pen at sonoma foie gras in california while hungary , israel and a few places in california and new york make foie gras , france produces and consumes 90 percent of the delicacy .
a traditional holiday image in france is the happy , beret-wearing farmer herding his flock of ducks and geese .
but making foie gras requires that geese and ducks be force-fed and kept immobile for the last days of their lives , until their livers become swollen and fat . foie gras has become controversial in places such as california , where its production will be banned starting in 2012 .
and even in france , a growing number of people are questioning the methods used in this billion-dollar industry . one animal rights group has made a film of what it calls the horrors of the force-feeding room and is trying to educate the french public about what the geese and ducks go through to produce foie gras .
dominique hoffpower is a member of the group . " they are kept in individual cages for about 10 days , " said hoffpower .
" they are force-fed with a tube , twice a day into their throats , about two pounds of corn per day .
and that makes their liver swell to about eight times its normal size so they ca n't breathe , they do n't sleep anymore and some of them die before the end .
that 's what foie gras is . " born to gorge ? but as he force-fed his ducks , st. blancard , insisted that the animals do not suffer : foie gras was first discovered by the ancient egyptians , he said , adding that making it only exploits the migrating waterfowl ’ s natural ability to gorge themselves and store the excess fat in their livers before long flights . " we do everything for the ducks to be comfortable , " he said .
" they always have clean water and fresh air .
yes , they have to digest intensively , that 's true and we ca n't deny it .
but they 're not sick .
it 's like a sporting challenge for them .
we do not hurt the birds because if they are unwell they can not produce a nice liver . " bildunterschrift : moulard ducks , 5-6 weeks old , gather in a covered pen but st. blancard admited that large , industrial producers may not take as much care with their birds . while animal activists so far have not driven any foie gras producers out of business in france , european union regulations may .
the eu has demanded that the cages widely used by french farmers be replaced by larger ones so that the birds can move freely , for example . for st. blancard , fulfilling the new regulations will set him back 15,400 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- - all for something he says is an attempt to bring more political correctness to the foie gras industry . eleanor beardsley -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : vive la baguette !

ms rice told journalists in the us that everyone recognised that some things in the un needed to be fixed .
she said john bolton , a long-time critic of the un and nominated as the next us ambassador to the body , would help update , reform and strengthen it .
her comments come as the un is embroiled in a scandal over corruption in its oil-for-food programme for iraq .
it has also been dogged by accusations of sexual abuse committed by un peacekeepers in africa .
un secretary-general kofi annan has accepted that change is urgently needed , and has proposed a series of sweeping reforms .
' not so great ' speaking to the american society of newspaper editors in washington , ms rice said : " as important an institution as it is , one has to say that there are some things that are not so great about the united nations right now . "

ms rice said mr bolton , who has pledged to work to improve un accountability and has complained of overlapping programmes and mandates , was needed to help update and reform the organisation .
mr bolton has said that the un needs us leadership to get it back on track , and that it should focus more on human rights violations and international terrorism .
ms rice 's remarks were one of the sharpest attacks to date on the un by a senior member of the bush administration , says the bbc 's michael voss in new york .
relations between washington and mr annan have been strained since the un security council failed to back the us-led war in iraq , and more recently over revelations about corruption in the oil-for-food programme .
the $ 60bn -lrb- £ 32bn -rrb- programme allowed saddam hussein 's iraq to sell oil in order to buy civilian goods and ease the impact of un sanctions imposed after iraq 's 1990 invasion of kuwait .

speaking on television , mr gutierrez said he had taken the drastic measures in order to maintain calm and stability in the country .
it follows mass protests and strikes in quito against the government .
the unrest was sparked by a government attempt last year to restructure the supreme court .
the state of emergency empowers the ecuadorian government to take extraordinary measures to quell unrest .
up to 10,000 people have been protesting in the streets of quito since thursday , banging pans and demanding the president 's resignation .
reports suggest that demonstrations continued into friday night after mr gutierrez 's announcement .
last week , the president took the unusual step of declaring that he still had the support of the armed forces , and that they would not intervene in the growing constitutional crisis .
' bias ' the crisis began in december , when mr gutierrez first fired the supreme court , alleging that the magistrates were biased against him .
the crisis deepened in march , when the new court dropped corruption charges against ex-president abdala bucaram .
mr bucaram 's roldosista party had backed mr gutierrez 's drive to replace the supreme court .
the party also helped to block an opposition attempt to impeach mr gutierrez in november .
opponents say dismissing the judges was part of a government deal to exonerate mr bucaram in return for his political support .
but mr gutierrez said the old court had to go because its judges were biased in favour of opposition parties , particularly the social christians .
the un and the us criticised his dismissal of the supreme court in december , and opposition politicians have accused him of behaving like dictator .
since 1997 , two presidents of ecuador have been forced out of office by street protests .
the bbc 's hannah hennessey in lima says mr gutierrez 's latest move suggests he has no plans of becoming the third president to go that way .

everyone will be focused on his face , trying to get an impression of the personality of the man chosen to lead the catholic church .
but the gammarelli family will be looking more closely at his white robes , checking to see how well they fit .
as papal tailors for generations , it is their job to make sure the newly elected pope has an outfit to wear .
hanging up close to the sistine chapel will be white vestments in three sizes , ready to fit a pope who is small , medium or large .
" we received the order from the vatican after the death of john paul ii , " says lorenzo gammarelli .
" four tailors have been working on it full-time , all week .
we have made vestments of wool and silk in each size , so there are six sets in all . "
discreet the firm is famously discreet about its distinguished customers .
but family pride was indulged by displaying the finished papal garments in the window , before they were sent to the vatican .
not , of course , that there was anything to identify the vestments , apart from the fact they were white .
the new pope will almost certainly be one of the 115 cardinals who enter the conclave on 18 april .
there will be only a short time between the white smoke that announces his election and his first appearance on the balcony of st peter 's basilica .
cardinals come in all shapes and sizes , and some are generously proportioned .
so will the off-the-peg robes cover all eventualities ?
" we seldom make a mistake , so there is a good chance they will fit , " lorenzo says with a smile .
last minute fitting behind the scenes at the vatican , nuns will be ready with needles and thread to make any last-minute adjustments .
after the pope 's election , the firm will be hoping for a phone call to arrange a proper fitting .
after his election , a new pope has to acquire a whole new wardrobe .
it really is a case of " i 've got nothing to wear " .
the new man will be free to choose his own tailor , but most recent popes have been happy to use the gammarelli .
the business was founded in 1792 , and lorenzo is the sixth generation of his family to join the firm .
the premises are in a side street close to the pantheon , but most tourists pass by without recognising the shop .
stepping inside is like entering a very traditional firm of gentlemen 's outfitters .
the shop fittings are all polished wood , and the shelves are stacked with rolls of cloth in every ecclesiastical colour - black , purple , red and white .
many senior clerics have been coming here for years , in some cases since their student days in rome .
being tailors to the pope must help business , but the staff like to think it is the quality of the material and the cut of the cloth that keeps their customers coming back .
" we are proud of our work , " says lorenzo gammarelli .
" we are famous for the quality of our clothes .
people do not come here just because of the pope .
they come here because we make good cassocks . "
" for the family , it is an enormous honour to make clothes for the pope " lorenzo gammarelli the framed portraits of former pontiffs hanging on the walls are the only indication of the firm 's distinguished clientele .
the white robes worn by john paul ii on his trips around the world must have been seen by more people than any other set of clothes .
the tailors at gammarelli say they never think about it ; their only concern is making sure the pope looks his best .
" for the family , it is an enormous honour to make clothes for the pope , " lorenzo says simply .
it is a tradition the firm hopes will continue after the election of the new pope .

howel vaughan lewis owned properties in london , cardiff , swansea and aberystwyth , and his estate is thought to run into millions of pounds .
among the groups set to benefit in his will is the welsh language society .
mr lewis died last month aged 87 and was buried in the graveyard at llanwenog , near lampeter in ceredigion .
the businessman left llanwenog when he was about nine and moved to london with his mother .
despite living in england for most of his life , he maintained strong links with his home nation .
this was reflected in the houses he owned and rented as they were all painted in the red and green of wales . "

dafydd morgan lewis , of the welsh language society in aberystwyth , said the group would receive 50 % of the estate .
" we welcome any gifts , but we wo n't be in a position to decide what to spend the money on because we do n't know how much we 're going to get , " he said .
" it looks as though it 's going to be a long time before we receive the money . "
chairwoman of urdd gobaith cymru , rhiannon lewis , said mr lewis ' beneficiaries were invited to attend his funeral on 22 march .
" i had a phone call from mr lewis ' executors and solicitors informing me that he had died and that we were invited to attend his funeral to learn more about him , " said mrs lewis .
" we attended his funeral where we did learn quite a bit about him , particularly from his tenants who spoke about the kindness he showed to them . "
mr lewis had moved to london in the late 1920s or early 1930s .
renovation work " his friends said the happiest day of his life was when people in wales voted for the welsh assembly , " she added .
" apparently he had no close family and came back to llanwenog to be buried with his mother . "
reverend bill fillery of st gwenog 's church , where mr lewis has been buried in the same grave as his mother , said he and his parishioners were delighted .
" some renovation work at the church is just being finished , but now we can now do more that we would not have considered a few months ago . "
" we need a car park so we could build one using the money or buy a bit of land .
" we could also put in a security system in place that we would not have considered previously . "

howel vaughan lewis owned properties in london , cardiff , swansea and aberystwyth , and his estate is thought to run into millions of pounds .
among the groups set to benefit in his will is the welsh language society .
mr lewis died last month aged 87 and was buried in the graveyard at llanwenog , near lampeter in ceredigion .
the businessman left llanwenog when he was about nine and moved to london with his mother .
despite living in england for most of his life , he maintained strong links with his home nation .
this was reflected in the houses he owned and rented as they were all painted in the red and green of wales .
his friends said the happiest day of his life was when people in wales voted for the welsh assembly rhiannon lewis , urdd gobaith cymru other groups set to receive a portion of his estate are plaid cymru , the welsh youth movement urdd gobaith cymru , merched y wawr -lrb- a welsh language women 's group -rrb- and llanwenog 's st gwenog 's church , which will receive £ 100,000 .
dafydd morgan lewis , of the welsh language society in aberystwyth , said the group would receive 50 % of the estate .
" we welcome any gifts , but we wo n't be in a position to decide what to spend the money on because we do n't know how much we 're going to get , " he said .
" it looks as though it 's going to be a long time before we receive the money . "
chairwoman of urdd gobaith cymru , rhiannon lewis , said mr lewis ' beneficiaries were invited to attend his funeral on 22 march .
" i had a phone call from mr lewis ' executors and solicitors informing me that he had died and that we were invited to attend his funeral to learn more about him , " said mrs lewis .
" we attended his funeral where we did learn quite a bit about him , particularly from his tenants who spoke about the kindness he showed to them . "
mr lewis had moved to london in the late 1920s or early 1930s .
renovation work " his friends said the happiest day of his life was when people in wales voted for the welsh assembly , " she added .
" apparently he had no close family and came back to llanwenog to be buried with his mother . "
reverend bill fillery of st gwenog 's church , where mr lewis has been buried in the same grave as his mother , said he and his parishioners were delighted .
" some renovation work at the church is just being finished , but now we can now do more that we would not have considered a few months ago . "
" we need a car park so we could build one using the money or buy a bit of land .
" we could also put in a security system in place that we would not have considered previously . "

stephen sackur , who has reported from jerusalem , cairo , washington and brussels is swapping his nomadic life as a correspondent for the comfort of a television studio and new role as presenter of bbc hardtalk .
stephen sackur during his time as bbc washington correspondent the phone rang at an inconvenient moment .
i was trying to find one of my daughter 's socks , which had miraculously escaped while stuck in the washing machine .
" where are you ? " said the voice .
it was a producer colleague .
he had the urgent tone of a man on the edge of nervous collapse .
" in brussels , at home with the kids , " i said , one hand still probing the insides of the washing machine .
" why what 's up ? "
" it 's the pope , " he explained .
" it looks like the end .
i need to know if you 're available " .
" well , my wife 's in beirut , " i said .
" i 've got three kids round my legs ; you know , i 'm on leave and i 'm about to start a new job , so ... "
my answer trailed away .
i was heading towards the word " no , " but i could n't quite get there .
" forget it , " said the voice briskly .
" i figured you were n't an option , but i had to try .
do n't worry we 'll find someone else " .
addiction so ended a decade and a half as a foreign correspondent .
the death of the pope forsaken for a missing sock .
a final reminder that in the hard-bitten business of news there is , ultimately , always someone else .
but i will miss the phone calls .
those summons to immediate , drop-everything action have been a major part of my working life .
the instant knot in the stomach , the frantic dash to the airport ; they may seem like dubious pleasures , but the buzz is irresistible ; it 's the sense of being in the thick of something important , of writing the first draft of a story that matters .
an early assignment : reporting from the 1989 velvet revolution my addiction - and i suppose that 's what it 's been - took hold in prague .
the velvet revolution of 1989 .
i was a cub radio reporter despatched by a trusting editor to convey the spirit of the crowds gathering nightly in wenceslas square .
i remember being overwhelmed by the singing , the communal ache for freedom given haunting voice .
i dutifully recorded my report and prepared to file it to london .
only then did it dawn on me ...
i had n't the foggiest idea how .
i 'd been issued with a strange contraption known as a mutterbox .
it had leads and a set of crocodile clips , but no instructions .
i threw myself on the mercies of a very senior bbc colleague who proceeded to dismantle my old bakelite hotel phone with a screwdriver .
he did something mysterious with the croc clips and within seconds i was through to bbc hq .
i turned to my celebrated colleague , tears of gratitude glistening in my eyes .
" you 're a disgrace , " he growled .
" if you do n't know how to use your equipment you do n't bloody well deserve to be here " .
competition so i grew up fast in foreign news .
i had to .
it was , and is , a highly competitive business .
there 's a flip-side to this extraordinary job .
i 've seen it in myself .
a tendency toward vanity , self-absorption and callousness now , of course , there 's a temptation to go all misty-eyed about those past assignments .
the night in israel when rabin was shot , the impeachment of william jefferson clinton , the day the us supreme court decided the identity of the us president .
i 'm leaving with a host of powerful memories , but my feelings about the job are best distilled in two very different episodes .
the first came in iraq .
a country especially dear to me , as my wife 's homeland .
it was there i saw the most distressing sight of my life .
men and women clawing at the earth , uncovering the first of the mass graves discovered after the fall of saddam hussein .
thousands of stinking corpses came out of the ground that day .
i saw infants with bullet holes blown through their skulls .
i was the only reporter there .
i sensed in that iraqi field that i was a necessary witness , in the right place at the right time .
but there 's a flip-side to this extraordinary job .
i 've seen it in myself .
a tendency toward vanity , self-absorption and callousness .
picture for a moment the scene on the morning of the 11 september 2001 .
i was on assignment in nicaragua , far from my base in washington dc .
i watched the attacks on the twin towers and the pentagon on a flickering tv .
and then i called my wife back home .
she was tearful and distraught .
our kids had been rushed out of school in an emergency drill .
it felt , she said , like war had broken out .
" god this is awful , " i said with feeling .
" i know , " she replied , " there may be thousands dead " .
" i do n't mean that " , i snapped .
" i 'm talking about me .
i 'm missing the biggest story of my life . "
every so often my wife reminds me of that shameful sentiment .
but she does n't need to .
i have n't forgotten it .
being a foreign correspondent is the best job in the world as long as you know when to stop .
and for me , it 's time to stop .
