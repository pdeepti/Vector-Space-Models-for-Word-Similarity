while there has been little respite from soccer action this summer , nothing can quite beat the beginning of a new league campaign . it seems that there is hardly time to take breath these days before the next soccer season is upon us .
this year , after the bundesliga came to a close on may 21 , fans had the pleasure of a major international tournament to tide them over the quiet summer weeks before their teams took to the field again .
the confederations cup kept soccer junkies on enough of a high to stave off any pre-season cold turkey . now the bundesliga is back and german soccer addicts can get their weekly fixes once more .
for many , there is no comparable drug and the wait for the season kick-off on friday , august 5 can not come quick enough . the opening game features reigning champions bayern munich against borussia mönchengladbach .
' gladbach , who suffered a torrid and almost disastrous last term , will want to get off to a good start in a bid to avoid a campaign battling relegation as they did for most of the 2004/05 season , escaping the drop by a point on the final day . unfortunately , they start by taking on a bayern team who have managed to keep hold of most of the players who cut a swathe through the league last time and romped home to a record 19th championship . personnel the same at championship central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten frings with thorsten frings the only first time regular deemed excess to requirements - the former borussia dortmund man returned to werder bremen during the close season - bayern will field a title-winning side boosted by the arrival of valerien ishmael from werder .
again , they will be the team to beat . runners-up schalke 04 will be looking to hit the ground running when they take on kaiserslautern on saturday in an attempt to get a jump on the bitter rivals .
the signing of german international kevin kuranyi may offset the loss of ailton to besiktas but schalke have also lost mike hanke to wolfsburg with no-one upfront to replace him .
the failed attempt to bring liverpool 's milan baros to the arena aufschalke leaves kuranyi and fellow international striker gerald asamoah leading the line , which in anyone 's books in no shabby strike force . kuranyi may be quickly forgotten at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart .
new coach giovanni trappatoni was swift to bring in ac milan 's danish striker jon dahl tomasson and fellow dane jesper gronkjaer to boost the stuttgarter 's chances of finally putting the previous seasons of choking at the death to rest .
vfb take on newly promoted msv duisburg on saturday . also-rans battling to keep up with the top teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season should see the usual suspects of also-rans battling to make the leap to the upper echelons and mount a serious title challenge .
among these again will no doubt be hertha berlin , werder bremen , hamburg sv and bayer leverkusen .
berlin recovered spectacularly after a dire start last season to challenge for the champions league , failing at the last hurdle by a point .
hertha travel to hanover for their first game . bremen , champions two years ago , will want to forget about last season .
they meekly conceded their title-defense to bayern and were humiliated in their champions league campaign .

the flying dutchman has been touted as the best of his generation and was tipped to go the way of other dutch greats to either barcelona or milan in a move which would take his game to the next level .
instead he chose the bundesliga and a mid-table team who flirted with relegation for most of the previous campaign .
his arrival however has got hsv buzzing again and they will be hoping van der vaart can inspire them to a top five finish this season . bayer leverkusen again showed great promise throughout the last season but lost at crucial times to see their challenge fall by the wayside .
finishing fifth was a major disappointment for klaus augenthaler 's side who showed their ruthless side all too little during the campaign .
a team used to challenging for the title in the past few years , this was not good enough .
things will have to improve for bayer to cause the teams who finished above them any real concern , starting with a win over newly promoted eintracht frankfurt on saturday . borussia dortmund to rise again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a phoenix which may complete a welcome resurrection from the ashes may be borussia dortmund .
bvb epitomized everything that is wrong in german football last season with financial woes bringing them to the brink of bankruptcy and overpaid and underperforming megastars facing the drop into oblivion with indifference . somehow after the winter break , bvb got it together and fought back from the relegation zone to within a whisker of the last uefa cup slot .
this season they will be looking to put the nightmare behind them , starting with a victory over vfl wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc köln are back after one season in the second division and all eyes will be on lukas podolski .
the boy wonder of german soccer is a target for bayern munich but for the time being he will be applying his prolific skills to keeping his team in the top flight .
their promotion season begins at home to fsv mainz at the weekend , a team looking to repeat their flying start to the season in their debut year last time out and one hoping to maintain that form throughout . all in all , the 2005/06 season has the makings of running true to form with the top teams again fighting it out to beat bayern munich to the title , the mid-tablers fighting for european slots and the perennial strugglers flirting with relegation .

while there has been little respite from soccer action this summer , nothing can quite beat the beginning of a new league campaign . it seems that there is hardly time to take breath these days before the next soccer season is upon us .
this year , after the bundesliga came to a close on may 21 , fans had the pleasure of a major international tournament to tide them over the quiet summer weeks before their teams took to the field again .
the confederations cup kept soccer junkies on enough of a high to stave off any pre-season cold turkey . now the bundesliga is back and german soccer addicts can get their weekly fixes once more .
for many , there is no comparable drug and the wait for the season kick-off on friday , august 5 can not come quick enough . the opening game features reigning champions bayern munich against borussia mönchengladbach .
' gladbach , who suffered a torrid and almost disastrous last term , will want to get off to a good start in a bid to avoid a campaign battling relegation as they did for most of the 2004/05 season , escaping the drop by a point on the final day . unfortunately , they start by taking on a bayern team who have managed to keep hold of most of the players who cut a swathe through the league last time and romped home to a record 19th championship . personnel the same at championship central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten frings with thorsten frings the only first time regular deemed excess to requirements - the former borussia dortmund man returned to werder bremen during the close season - bayern will field a title-winning side boosted by the arrival of valerien ishmael from werder .
again , they will be the team to beat . runners-up schalke 04 will be looking to hit the ground running when they take on kaiserslautern on saturday in an attempt to get a jump on the bitter rivals .
the signing of german international kevin kuranyi may offset the loss of ailton to besiktas but schalke have also lost mike hanke to wolfsburg with no-one upfront to replace him .
the failed attempt to bring liverpool 's milan baros to the arena aufschalke leaves kuranyi and fellow international striker gerald asamoah leading the line , which in anyone 's books in no shabby strike force . kuranyi may be quickly forgotten at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart .
new coach giovanni trappatoni was swift to bring in ac milan 's danish striker jon dahl tomasson and fellow dane jesper gronkjaer to boost the stuttgarter 's chances of finally putting the previous seasons of choking at the death to rest .
vfb take on newly promoted msv duisburg on saturday . also-rans battling to keep up with the top teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season should see the usual suspects of also-rans battling to make the leap to the upper echelons and mount a serious title challenge .
among these again will no doubt be hertha berlin , werder bremen , hamburg sv and bayer leverkusen .
berlin recovered spectacularly after a dire start last season to challenge for the champions league , failing at the last hurdle by a point .
hertha travel to hanover for their first game . bremen , champions two years ago , will want to forget about last season .
they meekly conceded their title-defense to bayern and were humiliated in their champions league campaign .
coach thomas schaaf will be hoping that his team will overcome arminia bielefeld on the first saturday of the season to start their pursuit of the title in style . happy hamburg have high hopes for dutch flyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raphael van der vaart hamburg sv secured possibly the most unexpected signing of the pre-season by taking dutch midfield superstar raphael van der vaart from ajax to the aol arena .

though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "
jägermeister leads the way a liquor distillery in the north of germany paved the way to today 's jersey sponsoring opportunities .

the stricter advertising rules of the day would n't allow the drink 's name , jägermeister , to be printed on the players ' jerseys .
from these modest beginnings that the bundesliga became europe 's sponsorship leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors " when jersey sponsoring is taken as the sponsorship ruler to judge the leagues , the bundesliga comes in first with some 90 million euros , then comes either the english or italian league , both of which get around 60 million .
that 's a big difference , " schröder said .
" in this regard , germany or the bundesliga is bit more professional and farther along in development . "
less money from other sources only the top foreign clubs can even come close to making the sponsorship deals made in the bundesliga .
english champions fc chelsea were recently rumored to have made a record-breaking contract with the south korean electronics manufacturer samsung , but even that was n't enough to take over at the top , according to schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus turin cashes in on two jersey sponsors " no , chelsea is not first , it 's juventus turin , " he said .
" but they do have two jersey sponsors , one for the league and one for the champions league matches .
if you can believe the press , they 're getting about 20 million euros . "
it may well be a case of making the best of a bad situation .

" we have been saying for a long time that axel springer has two strategic growth options : accelerated internationalization of the print business or expansion in the german tv market , " said axel springer chairman and ceo mathias doepfner after the announcement was made . " with the acquisition of prosiebensat.1 , we are pursuing a unique opportunity and systematically implementing one of these options . " prosiebensat.1 chairman and ceo guillaume de posch was in an equally positive mood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2005 crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz plant is one facility iran is threatening to restart iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis . " the proposals are unacceptable , " nuclear negotiator hossein moussavian said , describing them as a " clear violation " of agreements between iran and the european union .
" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .

" the proposals are unacceptable , " nuclear negotiator hossein moussavian said , describing them as a " clear violation " of agreements between iran and the european union .
" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .
" we will in any event restart the isfahan conversion plant , " moussavian told afp . bildunterschrift : an aerial photo shows iran 's uranim conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , south of the capital tehran , iran , in this wednesday , march 30 , 2005 , file photo .
iran agreed late monday to a two-day delay in reopening its nuclear processing plant in isfahan after receiving a request from the head of the u.n. 's atomic watchdog agency .
the conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate , known as yellowcake , into uranium hexaflouride gas .
the gas is then taken to natanz and fed into the centrifuges for enrichment . enrichment plants ready to go back online he had also warned thursday that if the europeans called an iaea meeting , iran may not maintain its freeze on enrichment at the natanz plant . pozzo di borgo said that under the terms of the offer , the eu would guarantee a durable supply of nuclear fuel , and iran 's access to atomic technology for civilian purposes and the nuclear energy market . brussels would also promote trade , investment and technology transfers , work towards a trade and cooperation agreement , and support tehran 's accession to the world trade organization . it also promised to develop long-term scientific and technological cooperation in various areas , as well as helping with communications , education and training , transport , tourism and seismology . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

" such a horrible crime can not and must not be explained with generalizations of this kind , " said merkel , who is the first major contender for the chancellery to come from the depressed east , where schönbohm 's comments drew a hail of criticism . " i spoke with jörg schönbohm -lrb- who belongs to merkel 's christian democratic union party -rrb- and expect him to end this discussion as soon as possible .

" such a horrible crime can not and must not be explained with generalizations of this kind , " said merkel , who is the first major contender for the chancellery to come from the depressed east , where schönbohm 's comments drew a hail of criticism . " i spoke with jörg schönbohm -lrb- who belongs to merkel 's christian democratic union party -rrb- and expect him to end this discussion as soon as possible . " schröder senses a scandal as election approaches chancellor gerhard schröder , sensing an opportunity to score points in a region where a new breakaway political grouping , the left party , has been gaining ground , said that schönbohm had " insulted the people of the east " with his " pseudo-psychology " and confused his historical facts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation was shocked to learn monday that a 39-year-old unemployed dental hygienist in brandenburg identified as sabine h. had been charged with killing nine of her newborn babies over an 11-year period and burying their remains in and around a storage shed . schönbohm apologized for his remarks friday but said he was trying to offer reasons why no one in her circle of friends , relatives and neighbors had noticed the astonishing cycle of pregnancies and deaths . comments come as majority lead decreases the strong lead enjoyed by merkel 's christian union alliance and her chosen coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , has slipped slightly in recent weeks , a drop which could rob them of a governing majority on election day .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.08.2005 soccer junkies prepare for bundesliga fix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that winning feeling ... again : everyone will be out to stop bayern the 2005/06 bundesliga season kicks-off on friday .
while there has been little respite from soccer action this summer , nothing can quite beat the beginning of a new league campaign . it seems that there is hardly time to take breath these days before the next soccer season is upon us .
this year , after the bundesliga came to a close on may 21 , fans had the pleasure of a major international tournament to tide them over the quiet summer weeks before their teams took to the field again .
the confederations cup kept soccer junkies on enough of a high to stave off any pre-season cold turkey . now the bundesliga is back and german soccer addicts can get their weekly fixes once more .
for many , there is no comparable drug and the wait for the season kick-off on friday , august 5 can not come quick enough . the opening game features reigning champions bayern munich against borussia mönchengladbach .
' gladbach , who suffered a torrid and almost disastrous last term , will want to get off to a good start in a bid to avoid a campaign battling relegation as they did for most of the 2004/05 season , escaping the drop by a point on the final day . unfortunately , they start by taking on a bayern team who have managed to keep hold of most of the players who cut a swathe through the league last time and romped home to a record 19th championship . personnel the same at championship central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten frings with thorsten frings the only first time regular deemed excess to requirements - the former borussia dortmund man returned to werder bremen during the close season - bayern will field a title-winning side boosted by the arrival of valerien ishmael from werder .
again , they will be the team to beat . runners-up schalke 04 will be looking to hit the ground running when they take on kaiserslautern on saturday in an attempt to get a jump on the bitter rivals .
the signing of german international kevin kuranyi may offset the loss of ailton to besiktas but schalke have also lost mike hanke to wolfsburg with no-one upfront to replace him .
the failed attempt to bring liverpool 's milan baros to the arena aufschalke leaves kuranyi and fellow international striker gerald asamoah leading the line , which in anyone 's books in no shabby strike force . kuranyi may be quickly forgotten at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart .
new coach giovanni trappatoni was swift to bring in ac milan 's danish striker jon dahl tomasson and fellow dane jesper gronkjaer to boost the stuttgarter 's chances of finally putting the previous seasons of choking at the death to rest .
vfb take on newly promoted msv duisburg on saturday . also-rans battling to keep up with the top teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season should see the usual suspects of also-rans battling to make the leap to the upper echelons and mount a serious title challenge .
among these again will no doubt be hertha berlin , werder bremen , hamburg sv and bayer leverkusen .
berlin recovered spectacularly after a dire start last season to challenge for the champions league , failing at the last hurdle by a point .
hertha travel to hanover for their first game . bremen , champions two years ago , will want to forget about last season .
they meekly conceded their title-defense to bayern and were humiliated in their champions league campaign .
coach thomas schaaf will be hoping that his team will overcome arminia bielefeld on the first saturday of the season to start their pursuit of the title in style . happy hamburg have high hopes for dutch flyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raphael van der vaart hamburg sv secured possibly the most unexpected signing of the pre-season by taking dutch midfield superstar raphael van der vaart from ajax to the aol arena .
the flying dutchman has been touted as the best of his generation and was tipped to go the way of other dutch greats to either barcelona or milan in a move which would take his game to the next level .
instead he chose the bundesliga and a mid-table team who flirted with relegation for most of the previous campaign .
his arrival however has got hsv buzzing again and they will be hoping van der vaart can inspire them to a top five finish this season . bayer leverkusen again showed great promise throughout the last season but lost at crucial times to see their challenge fall by the wayside .
finishing fifth was a major disappointment for klaus augenthaler 's side who showed their ruthless side all too little during the campaign .

while there has been little respite from soccer action this summer , nothing can quite beat the beginning of a new league campaign . it seems that there is hardly time to take breath these days before the next soccer season is upon us .
this year , after the bundesliga came to a close on may 21 , fans had the pleasure of a major international tournament to tide them over the quiet summer weeks before their teams took to the field again .
the confederations cup kept soccer junkies on enough of a high to stave off any pre-season cold turkey . now the bundesliga is back and german soccer addicts can get their weekly fixes once more .
for many , there is no comparable drug and the wait for the season kick-off on friday , august 5 can not come quick enough . the opening game features reigning champions bayern munich against borussia mönchengladbach .
' gladbach , who suffered a torrid and almost disastrous last term , will want to get off to a good start in a bid to avoid a campaign battling relegation as they did for most of the 2004/05 season , escaping the drop by a point on the final day . unfortunately , they start by taking on a bayern team who have managed to keep hold of most of the players who cut a swathe through the league last time and romped home to a record 19th championship . personnel the same at championship central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten frings with thorsten frings the only first time regular deemed excess to requirements - the former borussia dortmund man returned to werder bremen during the close season - bayern will field a title-winning side boosted by the arrival of valerien ishmael from werder .
again , they will be the team to beat . runners-up schalke 04 will be looking to hit the ground running when they take on kaiserslautern on saturday in an attempt to get a jump on the bitter rivals .
the signing of german international kevin kuranyi may offset the loss of ailton to besiktas but schalke have also lost mike hanke to wolfsburg with no-one upfront to replace him .
the failed attempt to bring liverpool 's milan baros to the arena aufschalke leaves kuranyi and fellow international striker gerald asamoah leading the line , which in anyone 's books in no shabby strike force . kuranyi may be quickly forgotten at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart .
new coach giovanni trappatoni was swift to bring in ac milan 's danish striker jon dahl tomasson and fellow dane jesper gronkjaer to boost the stuttgarter 's chances of finally putting the previous seasons of choking at the death to rest .
vfb take on newly promoted msv duisburg on saturday . also-rans battling to keep up with the top teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season should see the usual suspects of also-rans battling to make the leap to the upper echelons and mount a serious title challenge .
among these again will no doubt be hertha berlin , werder bremen , hamburg sv and bayer leverkusen .
berlin recovered spectacularly after a dire start last season to challenge for the champions league , failing at the last hurdle by a point .
hertha travel to hanover for their first game . bremen , champions two years ago , will want to forget about last season .
they meekly conceded their title-defense to bayern and were humiliated in their champions league campaign .
coach thomas schaaf will be hoping that his team will overcome arminia bielefeld on the first saturday of the season to start their pursuit of the title in style . happy hamburg have high hopes for dutch flyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raphael van der vaart hamburg sv secured possibly the most unexpected signing of the pre-season by taking dutch midfield superstar raphael van der vaart from ajax to the aol arena .
the flying dutchman has been touted as the best of his generation and was tipped to go the way of other dutch greats to either barcelona or milan in a move which would take his game to the next level .
instead he chose the bundesliga and a mid-table team who flirted with relegation for most of the previous campaign .
his arrival however has got hsv buzzing again and they will be hoping van der vaart can inspire them to a top five finish this season . bayer leverkusen again showed great promise throughout the last season but lost at crucial times to see their challenge fall by the wayside .
finishing fifth was a major disappointment for klaus augenthaler 's side who showed their ruthless side all too little during the campaign .
a team used to challenging for the title in the past few years , this was not good enough .
things will have to improve for bayer to cause the teams who finished above them any real concern , starting with a win over newly promoted eintracht frankfurt on saturday . borussia dortmund to rise again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a phoenix which may complete a welcome resurrection from the ashes may be borussia dortmund .

while there has been little respite from soccer action this summer , nothing can quite beat the beginning of a new league campaign . it seems that there is hardly time to take breath these days before the next soccer season is upon us .
this year , after the bundesliga came to a close on may 21 , fans had the pleasure of a major international tournament to tide them over the quiet summer weeks before their teams took to the field again .
the confederations cup kept soccer junkies on enough of a high to stave off any pre-season cold turkey . now the bundesliga is back and german soccer addicts can get their weekly fixes once more .
for many , there is no comparable drug and the wait for the season kick-off on friday , august 5 can not come quick enough . the opening game features reigning champions bayern munich against borussia mönchengladbach .
' gladbach , who suffered a torrid and almost disastrous last term , will want to get off to a good start in a bid to avoid a campaign battling relegation as they did for most of the 2004/05 season , escaping the drop by a point on the final day . unfortunately , they start by taking on a bayern team who have managed to keep hold of most of the players who cut a swathe through the league last time and romped home to a record 19th championship . personnel the same at championship central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten frings with thorsten frings the only first time regular deemed excess to requirements - the former borussia dortmund man returned to werder bremen during the close season - bayern will field a title-winning side boosted by the arrival of valerien ishmael from werder .
again , they will be the team to beat . runners-up schalke 04 will be looking to hit the ground running when they take on kaiserslautern on saturday in an attempt to get a jump on the bitter rivals .
the signing of german international kevin kuranyi may offset the loss of ailton to besiktas but schalke have also lost mike hanke to wolfsburg with no-one upfront to replace him .
the failed attempt to bring liverpool 's milan baros to the arena aufschalke leaves kuranyi and fellow international striker gerald asamoah leading the line , which in anyone 's books in no shabby strike force . kuranyi may be quickly forgotten at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart .
new coach giovanni trappatoni was swift to bring in ac milan 's danish striker jon dahl tomasson and fellow dane jesper gronkjaer to boost the stuttgarter 's chances of finally putting the previous seasons of choking at the death to rest .
vfb take on newly promoted msv duisburg on saturday . also-rans battling to keep up with the top teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season should see the usual suspects of also-rans battling to make the leap to the upper echelons and mount a serious title challenge .
among these again will no doubt be hertha berlin , werder bremen , hamburg sv and bayer leverkusen .
berlin recovered spectacularly after a dire start last season to challenge for the champions league , failing at the last hurdle by a point .
hertha travel to hanover for their first game . bremen , champions two years ago , will want to forget about last season .
they meekly conceded their title-defense to bayern and were humiliated in their champions league campaign .
coach thomas schaaf will be hoping that his team will overcome arminia bielefeld on the first saturday of the season to start their pursuit of the title in style . happy hamburg have high hopes for dutch flyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raphael van der vaart hamburg sv secured possibly the most unexpected signing of the pre-season by taking dutch midfield superstar raphael van der vaart from ajax to the aol arena .
the flying dutchman has been touted as the best of his generation and was tipped to go the way of other dutch greats to either barcelona or milan in a move which would take his game to the next level .
instead he chose the bundesliga and a mid-table team who flirted with relegation for most of the previous campaign .
his arrival however has got hsv buzzing again and they will be hoping van der vaart can inspire them to a top five finish this season . bayer leverkusen again showed great promise throughout the last season but lost at crucial times to see their challenge fall by the wayside .
finishing fifth was a major disappointment for klaus augenthaler 's side who showed their ruthless side all too little during the campaign .
a team used to challenging for the title in the past few years , this was not good enough .
things will have to improve for bayer to cause the teams who finished above them any real concern , starting with a win over newly promoted eintracht frankfurt on saturday . borussia dortmund to rise again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a phoenix which may complete a welcome resurrection from the ashes may be borussia dortmund .
bvb epitomized everything that is wrong in german football last season with financial woes bringing them to the brink of bankruptcy and overpaid and underperforming megastars facing the drop into oblivion with indifference . somehow after the winter break , bvb got it together and fought back from the relegation zone to within a whisker of the last uefa cup slot .
this season they will be looking to put the nightmare behind them , starting with a victory over vfl wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc köln are back after one season in the second division and all eyes will be on lukas podolski .
the boy wonder of german soccer is a target for bayern munich but for the time being he will be applying his prolific skills to keeping his team in the top flight .
their promotion season begins at home to fsv mainz at the weekend , a team looking to repeat their flying start to the season in their debut year last time out and one hoping to maintain that form throughout . all in all , the 2005/06 season has the makings of running true to form with the top teams again fighting it out to beat bayern munich to the title , the mid-tablers fighting for european slots and the perennial strugglers flirting with relegation .

" it is out of the question for us to consider or talk about any new conditions regarding the accession process slated to begin on oct .
3 , " erdogan told reporters in ankara . in a new complication to ankara 's long-standing eu bid , french prime minister dominique de villepin said tuesday that turkey must recognize the republic of cyprus before it can begin membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin " it seems to me inconceivable that such a negotiation process can begin with a country which does not recognize every one of the members of the european union , that is to say the 25 , " villepin told europe one radio . the conservative french daily le figaro reported wednesday , citing unnamed government ministers , that french president jacques chirac had lent support to his prime minister 's position in a cabinet meeting . turkey refuses to endorse cyprus ' internationally-recognized greek cypriot government , which joined the eu last year . german opposition backs france leaders of germany 's opposition christian democratic union party said they backed france 's call . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedbert pflüger " villepin is right , " friedbert pflüger , the party 's foreign policy expert , told reuters .
" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2005 crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz plant is one facility iran is threatening to restart iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis . " the proposals are unacceptable , " nuclear negotiator hossein moussavian said , describing them as a " clear violation " of agreements between iran and the european union .
" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .
" we will in any event restart the isfahan conversion plant , " moussavian told afp . bildunterschrift : an aerial photo shows iran 's uranim conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , south of the capital tehran , iran , in this wednesday , march 30 , 2005 , file photo .

" we have been saying for a long time that axel springer has two strategic growth options : accelerated internationalization of the print business or expansion in the german tv market , " said axel springer chairman and ceo mathias doepfner after the announcement was made . " with the acquisition of prosiebensat.1 , we are pursuing a unique opportunity and systematically implementing one of these options . " prosiebensat.1 chairman and ceo guillaume de posch was in an equally positive mood .
" in combination , both companies are well positioned to assume a strong competitive position and to pursue growth opportunities , particularly in the further diversification of the business . " he said .
" with axel springer it will be ensured that the successful corporate strategy and the broadcasting group model of prosiebensat.1 can be continued . " stoiber heralds a strengthening of the media sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber , leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , was among the first politicians to speak on the takeover and heralded the acquisition saying that the merger would be " an obvious strengthening of the media sector in germany . "
stoiber said that the move would not only secure existing jobs but provide new opportunities for germans by keeping the seat of one of europe 's media powerhouses in germany . fellow conservative günter nooke , the cdu / csu spokesperson for media and culture in the german parliament , also spoke of the stabilizing effect the merger would have on the currently fluid media landscape in germany , and in particular that of the capital if the newly expanded company set up base there .
" -lrb- the merger -rrb- would be an excellent and strong contribution to berlin as a media location , " nooke said . wolf-dieter ring , president of the bavarian center for new media , the organization in charge of commercial broadcasting in bavaria , welcomed the merger .
" this collaboration is a guarantee for long-term international competitiveness and the journalistic advancement of program quality . " journalists association fears " opinion monoploy " however , the creation of such a cross-media behemoth has caused major concern for some .
michael konken , chairman of germany 's association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- urged the german cartel office to block the merger , saying that it would be " disastrous " and would result in an " opinion monopoly " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konken said a 100 percent ownership of prosiebensat.1 will " have negative consequences on information and opinion purveyed to the public , something which does not conform to the ideals of a democratic state . " frank werneke , acting president of the ver.di trade union , echoed konken 's concerns about the merger infringing on the public choice and called for " the containment of media power across sector borders and a model of criteria for upholding the interests of the viewers . " some analysts see springer deal as smart move in the markets , however , there were reactions based firmly on the business sense of the deal with analysts predicting a glowing future for the merged media superpower . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " springer becomes an impressive and powerful force in the german and european media market , " said chris-oliver schickentanz , an analyst at dresdner bank in an interview with bloomberg .
" it will be easier for them to get big advertising accounts and they also will be able to heavily promote tv series in their print publications .

in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "
jägermeister leads the way a liquor distillery in the north of germany paved the way to today 's jersey sponsoring opportunities .
for a mere 160,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 82,000 euros -rrb- , günter mast got a 14-centimeter -lrb- 5.5-inch -rrb- drawing of a deer on the front of then-bundesliga team eintracht braunschweig 's shirts in 1973 .
the stricter advertising rules of the day would n't allow the drink 's name , jägermeister , to be printed on the players ' jerseys .
from these modest beginnings that the bundesliga became europe 's sponsorship leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors " when jersey sponsoring is taken as the sponsorship ruler to judge the leagues , the bundesliga comes in first with some 90 million euros , then comes either the english or italian league , both of which get around 60 million .
that 's a big difference , " schröder said .
" in this regard , germany or the bundesliga is bit more professional and farther along in development . "
less money from other sources only the top foreign clubs can even come close to making the sponsorship deals made in the bundesliga .
english champions fc chelsea were recently rumored to have made a record-breaking contract with the south korean electronics manufacturer samsung , but even that was n't enough to take over at the top , according to schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus turin cashes in on two jersey sponsors " no , chelsea is not first , it 's juventus turin , " he said .
" but they do have two jersey sponsors , one for the league and one for the champions league matches .
if you can believe the press , they 're getting about 20 million euros . "
it may well be a case of making the best of a bad situation .
as german clubs earn less and less from the sale of broadcasting rights - especially in comparison with other leagues - they have found sponsorship deals to be the best way of getting there hands on the needed cash . klaus ulrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer junkies prepare for bundesliga fix the 2005/06 bundesliga season kicks-off on friday .

"
dw 's uta thofern says that 's not something to hope for . " grand coalition " is a phrase that sounds promising , productive and harmonious for many germans , who still remember the time between 1966 and 1969 , when the first and only alliance of christian democrats and social democrats ruled the country on the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the great coalition do more for change in germany than student leaders such as rudi dutschke ?
things were n't that bad back then , some recollect .
indeed , the so-called black-red coalition probably did more to change the country than the supposedly revolutionary " generation 1968 , " which simply received more attention . back then , the grand coalition laid the foundation for germany 's societal liberalization , which was later completed by the coalition government of social democrats and free democrats that followed it .
black-red initiated a new policy approach towards the eastern bloc and made first steps towards modernizing the country 's system of government . what could be more enticing than a remake ?
relying on a definitely comfortable majority in parliament , such an alliance would be able to tackle the complete makeover germany so desperately needs .
it could happen without serious resistance from states nor painful blockades and endless discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would a new great coalition be able to avoid large-scale protests against social welfare reforms like the ones that took place in recent years ?
according to the latest polls , almost a third of voters is banking on a grand coalition and probably is n't just hoping for an end to party bickering but also softer reforms that are based on consensus and will be easier to bear as a result . a different country it 's all an illusion .
the sixties wo n't be coming back .
the leading politicians at the time , the christian democrat kurt georg kiesinger and the social democrat willy brandt , lived in a country , where unemployment was n't a problem and national debt was still a foreign word . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt -lrb- left -rrb- and kurt georg kiesinger -lrb- right -rrb- in 1966 germany was still a country were most people remained with one company until retirement and where childless couples were still considered doomed .
societal and political reforms in this long-gone federal republic were connected with social welfare kickbacks .
germany ca n't afford this any longer : it needs profound change , not soft compromise in the 21st century . additionally , a grand coalition is unlikely to bring an end to the current political standstill .
on the contrary : the gruelling debates that took place between germany 's christian democrat-controlled upper house and social democrat-controlled lower house of parliament would also continue during cabinet meetings . expanding the stalemate social democratic leaders who would succeed chancellor gerhard schröder and current party chair franz müntefering would also be unable to support serious reforms .
unlike during the 1960s , the party 's not on the upswing .
spd leaders would be caught between a populist opposition from the left and their duty to govern responsibly as part of a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would a great coalition simply cement the current stalemate ?
an alliance between cdu and spd could rely on a sound parliamentary majority , but it would n't be able to make clear decisions .
this would result in a watered-down reform program , which would only cost germany more precious time . sure , a broad-based reform coalition would be desirable in order to secure wide acceptance for necessary cuts .
but this would require all those involved to display a willingness to accept what 's necessary - something that does n't seem to be the case at the moment .
instead , germany 's voters and parties quite obviously still tend to indulge in collective self-delusion . uta thofern -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu / spd coalition bad news for economy economists assessing the possibility of a grand coalition of the spd and cdu in german government after the september election are concerned that such a coupling could spell more trouble for the economy .

" we have been saying for a long time that axel springer has two strategic growth options : accelerated internationalization of the print business or expansion in the german tv market , " said axel springer chairman and ceo mathias doepfner after the announcement was made . " with the acquisition of prosiebensat.1 , we are pursuing a unique opportunity and systematically implementing one of these options . " prosiebensat.1 chairman and ceo guillaume de posch was in an equally positive mood .
" in combination , both companies are well positioned to assume a strong competitive position and to pursue growth opportunities , particularly in the further diversification of the business . " he said .
" with axel springer it will be ensured that the successful corporate strategy and the broadcasting group model of prosiebensat.1 can be continued . " stoiber heralds a strengthening of the media sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber , leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , was among the first politicians to speak on the takeover and heralded the acquisition saying that the merger would be " an obvious strengthening of the media sector in germany . "
stoiber said that the move would not only secure existing jobs but provide new opportunities for germans by keeping the seat of one of europe 's media powerhouses in germany . fellow conservative günter nooke , the cdu / csu spokesperson for media and culture in the german parliament , also spoke of the stabilizing effect the merger would have on the currently fluid media landscape in germany , and in particular that of the capital if the newly expanded company set up base there .
" -lrb- the merger -rrb- would be an excellent and strong contribution to berlin as a media location , " nooke said . wolf-dieter ring , president of the bavarian center for new media , the organization in charge of commercial broadcasting in bavaria , welcomed the merger .
" this collaboration is a guarantee for long-term international competitiveness and the journalistic advancement of program quality . " journalists association fears " opinion monoploy " however , the creation of such a cross-media behemoth has caused major concern for some .
michael konken , chairman of germany 's association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- urged the german cartel office to block the merger , saying that it would be " disastrous " and would result in an " opinion monopoly " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konken said a 100 percent ownership of prosiebensat.1 will " have negative consequences on information and opinion purveyed to the public , something which does not conform to the ideals of a democratic state . " frank werneke , acting president of the ver.di trade union , echoed konken 's concerns about the merger infringing on the public choice and called for " the containment of media power across sector borders and a model of criteria for upholding the interests of the viewers . " some analysts see springer deal as smart move in the markets , however , there were reactions based firmly on the business sense of the deal with analysts predicting a glowing future for the merged media superpower . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " springer becomes an impressive and powerful force in the german and european media market , " said chris-oliver schickentanz , an analyst at dresdner bank in an interview with bloomberg .
" it will be easier for them to get big advertising accounts and they also will be able to heavily promote tv series in their print publications . " alexander mogg , a media consultant and partner at mercer management consulting in munich said , " in the mid- and long-term , the tv business probably also has more growth opportunities than the print business .
especially the young generation of consumers prefers visual media products , so springer is well advised to expand its tv business .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .

of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .

the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .

in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .

" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .

" such a horrible crime can not and must not be explained with generalizations of this kind , " said merkel , who is the first major contender for the chancellery to come from the depressed east , where schönbohm 's comments drew a hail of criticism . " i spoke with jörg schönbohm -lrb- who belongs to merkel 's christian democratic union party -rrb- and expect him to end this discussion as soon as possible . " schröder senses a scandal as election approaches chancellor gerhard schröder , sensing an opportunity to score points in a region where a new breakaway political grouping , the left party , has been gaining ground , said that schönbohm had " insulted the people of the east " with his " pseudo-psychology " and confused his historical facts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation was shocked to learn monday that a 39-year-old unemployed dental hygienist in brandenburg identified as sabine h. had been charged with killing nine of her newborn babies over an 11-year period and burying their remains in and around a storage shed . schönbohm apologized for his remarks friday but said he was trying to offer reasons why no one in her circle of friends , relatives and neighbors had noticed the astonishing cycle of pregnancies and deaths . comments come as majority lead decreases the strong lead enjoyed by merkel 's christian union alliance and her chosen coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , has slipped slightly in recent weeks , a drop which could rob them of a governing majority on election day .

" meanwhile , the east is considered to be a crucial battleground where shifts of a few percentage points could have an impact on the final outcome . the ex-communist states , with a population of about 16 million in a country of 82 million , are often seen by political scientists as a region where the national election can not necessarily be won but can certainly be lost . eastern germany an important battleground in other words , steep losses or strong gains in the east can tip the scales in a close vote , as they did in 2002 when schröder narrowly won re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder nach der abstimmung zur agenda 2010 bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder nimmt auf dem parteitag der spd im berliner hotel estrel am sonntag , 1 .

but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .

though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "
jägermeister leads the way a liquor distillery in the north of germany paved the way to today 's jersey sponsoring opportunities .
for a mere 160,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 82,000 euros -rrb- , günter mast got a 14-centimeter -lrb- 5.5-inch -rrb- drawing of a deer on the front of then-bundesliga team eintracht braunschweig 's shirts in 1973 .
the stricter advertising rules of the day would n't allow the drink 's name , jägermeister , to be printed on the players ' jerseys .
from these modest beginnings that the bundesliga became europe 's sponsorship leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors " when jersey sponsoring is taken as the sponsorship ruler to judge the leagues , the bundesliga comes in first with some 90 million euros , then comes either the english or italian league , both of which get around 60 million .
that 's a big difference , " schröder said .
" in this regard , germany or the bundesliga is bit more professional and farther along in development . "
less money from other sources only the top foreign clubs can even come close to making the sponsorship deals made in the bundesliga .
english champions fc chelsea were recently rumored to have made a record-breaking contract with the south korean electronics manufacturer samsung , but even that was n't enough to take over at the top , according to schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus turin cashes in on two jersey sponsors " no , chelsea is not first , it 's juventus turin , " he said .
" but they do have two jersey sponsors , one for the league and one for the champions league matches .
if you can believe the press , they 're getting about 20 million euros . "
it may well be a case of making the best of a bad situation .
as german clubs earn less and less from the sale of broadcasting rights - especially in comparison with other leagues - they have found sponsorship deals to be the best way of getting there hands on the needed cash . klaus ulrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer junkies prepare for bundesliga fix the 2005/06 bundesliga season kicks-off on friday .

while there has been little respite from soccer action this summer , nothing can quite beat the beginning of a new league campaign . it seems that there is hardly time to take breath these days before the next soccer season is upon us .
this year , after the bundesliga came to a close on may 21 , fans had the pleasure of a major international tournament to tide them over the quiet summer weeks before their teams took to the field again .

again , they will be the team to beat . runners-up schalke 04 will be looking to hit the ground running when they take on kaiserslautern on saturday in an attempt to get a jump on the bitter rivals .
the signing of german international kevin kuranyi may offset the loss of ailton to besiktas but schalke have also lost mike hanke to wolfsburg with no-one upfront to replace him .
the failed attempt to bring liverpool 's milan baros to the arena aufschalke leaves kuranyi and fellow international striker gerald asamoah leading the line , which in anyone 's books in no shabby strike force . kuranyi may be quickly forgotten at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart .

his arrival however has got hsv buzzing again and they will be hoping van der vaart can inspire them to a top five finish this season . bayer leverkusen again showed great promise throughout the last season but lost at crucial times to see their challenge fall by the wayside .
finishing fifth was a major disappointment for klaus augenthaler 's side who showed their ruthless side all too little during the campaign .

while there has been little respite from soccer action this summer , nothing can quite beat the beginning of a new league campaign . it seems that there is hardly time to take breath these days before the next soccer season is upon us .
this year , after the bundesliga came to a close on may 21 , fans had the pleasure of a major international tournament to tide them over the quiet summer weeks before their teams took to the field again .
the confederations cup kept soccer junkies on enough of a high to stave off any pre-season cold turkey . now the bundesliga is back and german soccer addicts can get their weekly fixes once more .
for many , there is no comparable drug and the wait for the season kick-off on friday , august 5 can not come quick enough . the opening game features reigning champions bayern munich against borussia mönchengladbach .
' gladbach , who suffered a torrid and almost disastrous last term , will want to get off to a good start in a bid to avoid a campaign battling relegation as they did for most of the 2004/05 season , escaping the drop by a point on the final day . unfortunately , they start by taking on a bayern team who have managed to keep hold of most of the players who cut a swathe through the league last time and romped home to a record 19th championship . personnel the same at championship central bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten frings with thorsten frings the only first time regular deemed excess to requirements - the former borussia dortmund man returned to werder bremen during the close season - bayern will field a title-winning side boosted by the arrival of valerien ishmael from werder .
again , they will be the team to beat . runners-up schalke 04 will be looking to hit the ground running when they take on kaiserslautern on saturday in an attempt to get a jump on the bitter rivals .
the signing of german international kevin kuranyi may offset the loss of ailton to besiktas but schalke have also lost mike hanke to wolfsburg with no-one upfront to replace him .
the failed attempt to bring liverpool 's milan baros to the arena aufschalke leaves kuranyi and fellow international striker gerald asamoah leading the line , which in anyone 's books in no shabby strike force . kuranyi may be quickly forgotten at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart .
new coach giovanni trappatoni was swift to bring in ac milan 's danish striker jon dahl tomasson and fellow dane jesper gronkjaer to boost the stuttgarter 's chances of finally putting the previous seasons of choking at the death to rest .
vfb take on newly promoted msv duisburg on saturday . also-rans battling to keep up with the top teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season should see the usual suspects of also-rans battling to make the leap to the upper echelons and mount a serious title challenge .
among these again will no doubt be hertha berlin , werder bremen , hamburg sv and bayer leverkusen .
berlin recovered spectacularly after a dire start last season to challenge for the champions league , failing at the last hurdle by a point .
hertha travel to hanover for their first game . bremen , champions two years ago , will want to forget about last season .
they meekly conceded their title-defense to bayern and were humiliated in their champions league campaign .
coach thomas schaaf will be hoping that his team will overcome arminia bielefeld on the first saturday of the season to start their pursuit of the title in style . happy hamburg have high hopes for dutch flyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raphael van der vaart hamburg sv secured possibly the most unexpected signing of the pre-season by taking dutch midfield superstar raphael van der vaart from ajax to the aol arena .
the flying dutchman has been touted as the best of his generation and was tipped to go the way of other dutch greats to either barcelona or milan in a move which would take his game to the next level .
instead he chose the bundesliga and a mid-table team who flirted with relegation for most of the previous campaign .
his arrival however has got hsv buzzing again and they will be hoping van der vaart can inspire them to a top five finish this season . bayer leverkusen again showed great promise throughout the last season but lost at crucial times to see their challenge fall by the wayside .
finishing fifth was a major disappointment for klaus augenthaler 's side who showed their ruthless side all too little during the campaign .
a team used to challenging for the title in the past few years , this was not good enough .
things will have to improve for bayer to cause the teams who finished above them any real concern , starting with a win over newly promoted eintracht frankfurt on saturday . borussia dortmund to rise again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a phoenix which may complete a welcome resurrection from the ashes may be borussia dortmund .
bvb epitomized everything that is wrong in german football last season with financial woes bringing them to the brink of bankruptcy and overpaid and underperforming megastars facing the drop into oblivion with indifference . somehow after the winter break , bvb got it together and fought back from the relegation zone to within a whisker of the last uefa cup slot .
this season they will be looking to put the nightmare behind them , starting with a victory over vfl wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc köln are back after one season in the second division and all eyes will be on lukas podolski .
the boy wonder of german soccer is a target for bayern munich but for the time being he will be applying his prolific skills to keeping his team in the top flight .
their promotion season begins at home to fsv mainz at the weekend , a team looking to repeat their flying start to the season in their debut year last time out and one hoping to maintain that form throughout . all in all , the 2005/06 season has the makings of running true to form with the top teams again fighting it out to beat bayern munich to the title , the mid-tablers fighting for european slots and the perennial strugglers flirting with relegation .

again , they will be the team to beat . runners-up schalke 04 will be looking to hit the ground running when they take on kaiserslautern on saturday in an attempt to get a jump on the bitter rivals .
the signing of german international kevin kuranyi may offset the loss of ailton to besiktas but schalke have also lost mike hanke to wolfsburg with no-one upfront to replace him .
the failed attempt to bring liverpool 's milan baros to the arena aufschalke leaves kuranyi and fellow international striker gerald asamoah leading the line , which in anyone 's books in no shabby strike force . kuranyi may be quickly forgotten at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart .
new coach giovanni trappatoni was swift to bring in ac milan 's danish striker jon dahl tomasson and fellow dane jesper gronkjaer to boost the stuttgarter 's chances of finally putting the previous seasons of choking at the death to rest .
vfb take on newly promoted msv duisburg on saturday . also-rans battling to keep up with the top teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season should see the usual suspects of also-rans battling to make the leap to the upper echelons and mount a serious title challenge .
among these again will no doubt be hertha berlin , werder bremen , hamburg sv and bayer leverkusen .
berlin recovered spectacularly after a dire start last season to challenge for the champions league , failing at the last hurdle by a point .
hertha travel to hanover for their first game . bremen , champions two years ago , will want to forget about last season .
they meekly conceded their title-defense to bayern and were humiliated in their champions league campaign .

the flying dutchman has been touted as the best of his generation and was tipped to go the way of other dutch greats to either barcelona or milan in a move which would take his game to the next level .
instead he chose the bundesliga and a mid-table team who flirted with relegation for most of the previous campaign .
his arrival however has got hsv buzzing again and they will be hoping van der vaart can inspire them to a top five finish this season . bayer leverkusen again showed great promise throughout the last season but lost at crucial times to see their challenge fall by the wayside .
finishing fifth was a major disappointment for klaus augenthaler 's side who showed their ruthless side all too little during the campaign .
a team used to challenging for the title in the past few years , this was not good enough .
things will have to improve for bayer to cause the teams who finished above them any real concern , starting with a win over newly promoted eintracht frankfurt on saturday . borussia dortmund to rise again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a phoenix which may complete a welcome resurrection from the ashes may be borussia dortmund .
bvb epitomized everything that is wrong in german football last season with financial woes bringing them to the brink of bankruptcy and overpaid and underperforming megastars facing the drop into oblivion with indifference . somehow after the winter break , bvb got it together and fought back from the relegation zone to within a whisker of the last uefa cup slot .

their promotion season begins at home to fsv mainz at the weekend , a team looking to repeat their flying start to the season in their debut year last time out and one hoping to maintain that form throughout . all in all , the 2005/06 season has the makings of running true to form with the top teams again fighting it out to beat bayern munich to the title , the mid-tablers fighting for european slots and the perennial strugglers flirting with relegation .

though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .

though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "
jägermeister leads the way a liquor distillery in the north of germany paved the way to today 's jersey sponsoring opportunities .
for a mere 160,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 82,000 euros -rrb- , günter mast got a 14-centimeter -lrb- 5.5-inch -rrb- drawing of a deer on the front of then-bundesliga team eintracht braunschweig 's shirts in 1973 .
the stricter advertising rules of the day would n't allow the drink 's name , jägermeister , to be printed on the players ' jerseys .
from these modest beginnings that the bundesliga became europe 's sponsorship leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors " when jersey sponsoring is taken as the sponsorship ruler to judge the leagues , the bundesliga comes in first with some 90 million euros , then comes either the english or italian league , both of which get around 60 million .
that 's a big difference , " schröder said .
" in this regard , germany or the bundesliga is bit more professional and farther along in development . "
less money from other sources only the top foreign clubs can even come close to making the sponsorship deals made in the bundesliga .
english champions fc chelsea were recently rumored to have made a record-breaking contract with the south korean electronics manufacturer samsung , but even that was n't enough to take over at the top , according to schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus turin cashes in on two jersey sponsors " no , chelsea is not first , it 's juventus turin , " he said .
" but they do have two jersey sponsors , one for the league and one for the champions league matches .
if you can believe the press , they 're getting about 20 million euros . "
it may well be a case of making the best of a bad situation .

" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .
" we will in any event restart the isfahan conversion plant , " moussavian told afp . bildunterschrift : an aerial photo shows iran 's uranim conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , south of the capital tehran , iran , in this wednesday , march 30 , 2005 , file photo .
iran agreed late monday to a two-day delay in reopening its nuclear processing plant in isfahan after receiving a request from the head of the u.n. 's atomic watchdog agency .
the conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate , known as yellowcake , into uranium hexaflouride gas .
the gas is then taken to natanz and fed into the centrifuges for enrichment . enrichment plants ready to go back online he had also warned thursday that if the europeans called an iaea meeting , iran may not maintain its freeze on enrichment at the natanz plant . pozzo di borgo said that under the terms of the offer , the eu would guarantee a durable supply of nuclear fuel , and iran 's access to atomic technology for civilian purposes and the nuclear energy market . brussels would also promote trade , investment and technology transfers , work towards a trade and cooperation agreement , and support tehran 's accession to the world trade organization . it also promised to develop long-term scientific and technological cooperation in various areas , as well as helping with communications , education and training , transport , tourism and seismology . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

" such a horrible crime can not and must not be explained with generalizations of this kind , " said merkel , who is the first major contender for the chancellery to come from the depressed east , where schönbohm 's comments drew a hail of criticism . " i spoke with jörg schönbohm -lrb- who belongs to merkel 's christian democratic union party -rrb- and expect him to end this discussion as soon as possible . " schröder senses a scandal as election approaches chancellor gerhard schröder , sensing an opportunity to score points in a region where a new breakaway political grouping , the left party , has been gaining ground , said that schönbohm had " insulted the people of the east " with his " pseudo-psychology " and confused his historical facts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation was shocked to learn monday that a 39-year-old unemployed dental hygienist in brandenburg identified as sabine h. had been charged with killing nine of her newborn babies over an 11-year period and burying their remains in and around a storage shed . schönbohm apologized for his remarks friday but said he was trying to offer reasons why no one in her circle of friends , relatives and neighbors had noticed the astonishing cycle of pregnancies and deaths . comments come as majority lead decreases the strong lead enjoyed by merkel 's christian union alliance and her chosen coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , has slipped slightly in recent weeks , a drop which could rob them of a governing majority on election day .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- merkel has not helped matters with a series of blunders this week while explaining key planks of her economic program , leading the normally staid berlin daily tagesspiegel to splash the headline " it 's the economy , stupid ! " meanwhile , the east is considered to be a crucial battleground where shifts of a few percentage points could have an impact on the final outcome . the ex-communist states , with a population of about 16 million in a country of 82 million , are often seen by political scientists as a region where the national election can not necessarily be won but can certainly be lost . eastern germany an important battleground in other words , steep losses or strong gains in the east can tip the scales in a close vote , as they did in 2002 when schröder narrowly won re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder nach der abstimmung zur agenda 2010 bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder nimmt auf dem parteitag der spd im berliner hotel estrel am sonntag , 1 .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .

" it is out of the question for us to consider or talk about any new conditions regarding the accession process slated to begin on oct .
3 , " erdogan told reporters in ankara . in a new complication to ankara 's long-standing eu bid , french prime minister dominique de villepin said tuesday that turkey must recognize the republic of cyprus before it can begin membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin " it seems to me inconceivable that such a negotiation process can begin with a country which does not recognize every one of the members of the european union , that is to say the 25 , " villepin told europe one radio . the conservative french daily le figaro reported wednesday , citing unnamed government ministers , that french president jacques chirac had lent support to his prime minister 's position in a cabinet meeting . turkey refuses to endorse cyprus ' internationally-recognized greek cypriot government , which joined the eu last year . german opposition backs france leaders of germany 's opposition christian democratic union party said they backed france 's call . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedbert pflüger " villepin is right , " friedbert pflüger , the party 's foreign policy expert , told reuters .
" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .
17 summit - which approved starting accession talks with turkey - that the protocol would not amount to a recognition of cyprus . " unfortunately we are now seeing contradictory statements , " he added .
" this is really regrettable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks holding turkish cypriot , left , turkish flags , march to the parliament in ankara turkey only recognizes the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus , proclaimed in 1983 , nine years after turkish troops occupied the northern third of cyprus in response to an athens-engineered greek cypriot coup in nicosia aimed at uniting the mediterranean island with greece . turkey says its position towards the greek cypriot administration will remain unchanged until the conflict is resolved and the turkish and greek communities of the island are reunified . turkish cypriots supported unification in a referendum just ahead of cyprus ' eu entry in may 2004 , but greek cypriots rejected the plan . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey comes closer to eu membership turkey announced on friday that it had signed a key document on the path to european union membership , paving the way for it to start talks on joining the bloc in october .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind election 2005 -pipe- 05.08.2005 opinion : germany 's collective self-delusion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm not wearing red because i want to work with you " the new left party is doing well in polls , increasing chances that christian democrats and social democrats will form the next government in a " grand coalition . "
dw 's uta thofern says that 's not something to hope for . " grand coalition " is a phrase that sounds promising , productive and harmonious for many germans , who still remember the time between 1966 and 1969 , when the first and only alliance of christian democrats and social democrats ruled the country on the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the great coalition do more for change in germany than student leaders such as rudi dutschke ?
things were n't that bad back then , some recollect .
indeed , the so-called black-red coalition probably did more to change the country than the supposedly revolutionary " generation 1968 , " which simply received more attention . back then , the grand coalition laid the foundation for germany 's societal liberalization , which was later completed by the coalition government of social democrats and free democrats that followed it .
black-red initiated a new policy approach towards the eastern bloc and made first steps towards modernizing the country 's system of government . what could be more enticing than a remake ?
relying on a definitely comfortable majority in parliament , such an alliance would be able to tackle the complete makeover germany so desperately needs .
it could happen without serious resistance from states nor painful blockades and endless discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would a new great coalition be able to avoid large-scale protests against social welfare reforms like the ones that took place in recent years ?
according to the latest polls , almost a third of voters is banking on a grand coalition and probably is n't just hoping for an end to party bickering but also softer reforms that are based on consensus and will be easier to bear as a result . a different country it 's all an illusion .
the sixties wo n't be coming back .
the leading politicians at the time , the christian democrat kurt georg kiesinger and the social democrat willy brandt , lived in a country , where unemployment was n't a problem and national debt was still a foreign word . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt -lrb- left -rrb- and kurt georg kiesinger -lrb- right -rrb- in 1966 germany was still a country were most people remained with one company until retirement and where childless couples were still considered doomed .

" such a horrible crime can not and must not be explained with generalizations of this kind , " said merkel , who is the first major contender for the chancellery to come from the depressed east , where schönbohm 's comments drew a hail of criticism . " i spoke with jörg schönbohm -lrb- who belongs to merkel 's christian democratic union party -rrb- and expect him to end this discussion as soon as possible . " schröder senses a scandal as election approaches chancellor gerhard schröder , sensing an opportunity to score points in a region where a new breakaway political grouping , the left party , has been gaining ground , said that schönbohm had " insulted the people of the east " with his " pseudo-psychology " and confused his historical facts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation was shocked to learn monday that a 39-year-old unemployed dental hygienist in brandenburg identified as sabine h. had been charged with killing nine of her newborn babies over an 11-year period and burying their remains in and around a storage shed . schönbohm apologized for his remarks friday but said he was trying to offer reasons why no one in her circle of friends , relatives and neighbors had noticed the astonishing cycle of pregnancies and deaths . comments come as majority lead decreases the strong lead enjoyed by merkel 's christian union alliance and her chosen coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , has slipped slightly in recent weeks , a drop which could rob them of a governing majority on election day .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- - german conservative opposition leader angela merkel gestures during her speech following german chancellor gerhard schroeder 's policy statement on the iraq war in the berlin reichstag thursday , april 3 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- merkel has not helped matters with a series of blunders this week while explaining key planks of her economic program , leading the normally staid berlin daily tagesspiegel to splash the headline " it 's the economy , stupid ! " meanwhile , the east is considered to be a crucial battleground where shifts of a few percentage points could have an impact on the final outcome . the ex-communist states , with a population of about 16 million in a country of 82 million , are often seen by political scientists as a region where the national election can not necessarily be won but can certainly be lost . eastern germany an important battleground in other words , steep losses or strong gains in the east can tip the scales in a close vote , as they did in 2002 when schröder narrowly won re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder nach der abstimmung zur agenda 2010 bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder nimmt auf dem parteitag der spd im berliner hotel estrel am sonntag , 1 .

schroeder needs the approval of the delegates for his so-called " agenda 2010 " plan to relax job protection laws and cut benefits for the unemployed.the " agenda 2010 " is meant to fight the german unemployment of nearly 11 percent and an economy in its third year of near-zero growth .
-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- a poll released friday showed schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- with 28 percent support , up two points from last week , versus 42 percent for merkel 's cdu / csu , down one point . the junior partner in the ruling coalition , the greens , tallied nine percent against eight percent for the free democrats . the left party scored nine percent in the poll by the forschungsgruppe wahlen , and was the most popular party in the east . separately , the left party 's chief candidate from the east , gregor gysi , ruled out forming a coalition with the spd after the election , despite polls indicating that an alliance of the two parties plus the greens could win a governing majority . schröder and greens leaders have already rejected the idea of a coalition with the left party . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police search for more babies after gruesome find police investigating the suspected worst case of infanticide in german postwar history said they were searching wednesday for further possible remains , days after the discovery of nine dead newborns .

in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .

though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "
jägermeister leads the way a liquor distillery in the north of germany paved the way to today 's jersey sponsoring opportunities .
for a mere 160,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 82,000 euros -rrb- , günter mast got a 14-centimeter -lrb- 5.5-inch -rrb- drawing of a deer on the front of then-bundesliga team eintracht braunschweig 's shirts in 1973 .
the stricter advertising rules of the day would n't allow the drink 's name , jägermeister , to be printed on the players ' jerseys .
from these modest beginnings that the bundesliga became europe 's sponsorship leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors " when jersey sponsoring is taken as the sponsorship ruler to judge the leagues , the bundesliga comes in first with some 90 million euros , then comes either the english or italian league , both of which get around 60 million .
that 's a big difference , " schröder said .
" in this regard , germany or the bundesliga is bit more professional and farther along in development . "
less money from other sources only the top foreign clubs can even come close to making the sponsorship deals made in the bundesliga .
english champions fc chelsea were recently rumored to have made a record-breaking contract with the south korean electronics manufacturer samsung , but even that was n't enough to take over at the top , according to schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus turin cashes in on two jersey sponsors " no , chelsea is not first , it 's juventus turin , " he said .
" but they do have two jersey sponsors , one for the league and one for the champions league matches .
if you can believe the press , they 're getting about 20 million euros . "
it may well be a case of making the best of a bad situation .
as german clubs earn less and less from the sale of broadcasting rights - especially in comparison with other leagues - they have found sponsorship deals to be the best way of getting there hands on the needed cash . klaus ulrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer junkies prepare for bundesliga fix the 2005/06 bundesliga season kicks-off on friday .
while there has been little respite from soccer action this summer , nothing can quite beat the beginning of a new league campaign .

now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash .

to be an olympic sponsor you need a lot of money , and more importantly you have to make sure your competition ca n't show its face .

" the proposals are unacceptable , " nuclear negotiator hossein moussavian said , describing them as a " clear violation " of agreements between iran and the european union .
" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .
" we will in any event restart the isfahan conversion plant , " moussavian told afp . bildunterschrift : an aerial photo shows iran 's uranim conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , south of the capital tehran , iran , in this wednesday , march 30 , 2005 , file photo .
iran agreed late monday to a two-day delay in reopening its nuclear processing plant in isfahan after receiving a request from the head of the u.n. 's atomic watchdog agency .
the conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate , known as yellowcake , into uranium hexaflouride gas .
the gas is then taken to natanz and fed into the centrifuges for enrichment . enrichment plants ready to go back online he had also warned thursday that if the europeans called an iaea meeting , iran may not maintain its freeze on enrichment at the natanz plant . pozzo di borgo said that under the terms of the offer , the eu would guarantee a durable supply of nuclear fuel , and iran 's access to atomic technology for civilian purposes and the nuclear energy market . brussels would also promote trade , investment and technology transfers , work towards a trade and cooperation agreement , and support tehran 's accession to the world trade organization . it also promised to develop long-term scientific and technological cooperation in various areas , as well as helping with communications , education and training , transport , tourism and seismology . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.08.2005 bayern throw down the gauntlet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't pretty , and it was n't easy for the defending champs bayern the 2005-06 season began just like the last one ended .
bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .

" we have been saying for a long time that axel springer has two strategic growth options : accelerated internationalization of the print business or expansion in the german tv market , " said axel springer chairman and ceo mathias doepfner after the announcement was made . " with the acquisition of prosiebensat.1 , we are pursuing a unique opportunity and systematically implementing one of these options . " prosiebensat.1 chairman and ceo guillaume de posch was in an equally positive mood .
" in combination , both companies are well positioned to assume a strong competitive position and to pursue growth opportunities , particularly in the further diversification of the business . " he said .
" with axel springer it will be ensured that the successful corporate strategy and the broadcasting group model of prosiebensat.1 can be continued . " stoiber heralds a strengthening of the media sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber , leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , was among the first politicians to speak on the takeover and heralded the acquisition saying that the merger would be " an obvious strengthening of the media sector in germany . "
stoiber said that the move would not only secure existing jobs but provide new opportunities for germans by keeping the seat of one of europe 's media powerhouses in germany . fellow conservative günter nooke , the cdu / csu spokesperson for media and culture in the german parliament , also spoke of the stabilizing effect the merger would have on the currently fluid media landscape in germany , and in particular that of the capital if the newly expanded company set up base there .
" -lrb- the merger -rrb- would be an excellent and strong contribution to berlin as a media location , " nooke said . wolf-dieter ring , president of the bavarian center for new media , the organization in charge of commercial broadcasting in bavaria , welcomed the merger .
" this collaboration is a guarantee for long-term international competitiveness and the journalistic advancement of program quality . " journalists association fears " opinion monoploy " however , the creation of such a cross-media behemoth has caused major concern for some .
michael konken , chairman of germany 's association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- urged the german cartel office to block the merger , saying that it would be " disastrous " and would result in an " opinion monopoly " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konken said a 100 percent ownership of prosiebensat.1 will " have negative consequences on information and opinion purveyed to the public , something which does not conform to the ideals of a democratic state . " frank werneke , acting president of the ver.di trade union , echoed konken 's concerns about the merger infringing on the public choice and called for " the containment of media power across sector borders and a model of criteria for upholding the interests of the viewers . " some analysts see springer deal as smart move in the markets , however , there were reactions based firmly on the business sense of the deal with analysts predicting a glowing future for the merged media superpower . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " springer becomes an impressive and powerful force in the german and european media market , " said chris-oliver schickentanz , an analyst at dresdner bank in an interview with bloomberg .
" it will be easier for them to get big advertising accounts and they also will be able to heavily promote tv series in their print publications . " alexander mogg , a media consultant and partner at mercer management consulting in munich said , " in the mid- and long-term , the tv business probably also has more growth opportunities than the print business .
especially the young generation of consumers prefers visual media products , so springer is well advised to expand its tv business .

" the proposals are unacceptable , " nuclear negotiator hossein moussavian said , describing them as a " clear violation " of agreements between iran and the european union .
" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .
" we will in any event restart the isfahan conversion plant , " moussavian told afp . bildunterschrift : an aerial photo shows iran 's uranim conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , south of the capital tehran , iran , in this wednesday , march 30 , 2005 , file photo .
iran agreed late monday to a two-day delay in reopening its nuclear processing plant in isfahan after receiving a request from the head of the u.n. 's atomic watchdog agency .
the conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate , known as yellowcake , into uranium hexaflouride gas .
the gas is then taken to natanz and fed into the centrifuges for enrichment . enrichment plants ready to go back online he had also warned thursday that if the europeans called an iaea meeting , iran may not maintain its freeze on enrichment at the natanz plant . pozzo di borgo said that under the terms of the offer , the eu would guarantee a durable supply of nuclear fuel , and iran 's access to atomic technology for civilian purposes and the nuclear energy market . brussels would also promote trade , investment and technology transfers , work towards a trade and cooperation agreement , and support tehran 's accession to the world trade organization . it also promised to develop long-term scientific and technological cooperation in various areas , as well as helping with communications , education and training , transport , tourism and seismology . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .

combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .

" the proposals are unacceptable , " nuclear negotiator hossein moussavian said , describing them as a " clear violation " of agreements between iran and the european union .
" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .
" we will in any event restart the isfahan conversion plant , " moussavian told afp . bildunterschrift : an aerial photo shows iran 's uranim conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , south of the capital tehran , iran , in this wednesday , march 30 , 2005 , file photo .
iran agreed late monday to a two-day delay in reopening its nuclear processing plant in isfahan after receiving a request from the head of the u.n. 's atomic watchdog agency .
the conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate , known as yellowcake , into uranium hexaflouride gas .
the gas is then taken to natanz and fed into the centrifuges for enrichment . enrichment plants ready to go back online he had also warned thursday that if the europeans called an iaea meeting , iran may not maintain its freeze on enrichment at the natanz plant . pozzo di borgo said that under the terms of the offer , the eu would guarantee a durable supply of nuclear fuel , and iran 's access to atomic technology for civilian purposes and the nuclear energy market . brussels would also promote trade , investment and technology transfers , work towards a trade and cooperation agreement , and support tehran 's accession to the world trade organization . it also promised to develop long-term scientific and technological cooperation in various areas , as well as helping with communications , education and training , transport , tourism and seismology . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .
the numerous contenders in the bundesliga have now received their first message as to whom they must beat in this season .

" the proposals are unacceptable , " nuclear negotiator hossein moussavian said , describing them as a " clear violation " of agreements between iran and the european union .
" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .
" we will in any event restart the isfahan conversion plant , " moussavian told afp . bildunterschrift : an aerial photo shows iran 's uranim conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , south of the capital tehran , iran , in this wednesday , march 30 , 2005 , file photo .
iran agreed late monday to a two-day delay in reopening its nuclear processing plant in isfahan after receiving a request from the head of the u.n. 's atomic watchdog agency .
the conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate , known as yellowcake , into uranium hexaflouride gas .
the gas is then taken to natanz and fed into the centrifuges for enrichment . enrichment plants ready to go back online he had also warned thursday that if the europeans called an iaea meeting , iran may not maintain its freeze on enrichment at the natanz plant . pozzo di borgo said that under the terms of the offer , the eu would guarantee a durable supply of nuclear fuel , and iran 's access to atomic technology for civilian purposes and the nuclear energy market . brussels would also promote trade , investment and technology transfers , work towards a trade and cooperation agreement , and support tehran 's accession to the world trade organization . it also promised to develop long-term scientific and technological cooperation in various areas , as well as helping with communications , education and training , transport , tourism and seismology . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.08.2005 shirtfronts worth millions to sponsors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't throw that jersey - it 's worth millions !
though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "
jägermeister leads the way a liquor distillery in the north of germany paved the way to today 's jersey sponsoring opportunities .
for a mere 160,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 82,000 euros -rrb- , günter mast got a 14-centimeter -lrb- 5.5-inch -rrb- drawing of a deer on the front of then-bundesliga team eintracht braunschweig 's shirts in 1973 .
the stricter advertising rules of the day would n't allow the drink 's name , jägermeister , to be printed on the players ' jerseys .
from these modest beginnings that the bundesliga became europe 's sponsorship leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors " when jersey sponsoring is taken as the sponsorship ruler to judge the leagues , the bundesliga comes in first with some 90 million euros , then comes either the english or italian league , both of which get around 60 million .
that 's a big difference , " schröder said .
" in this regard , germany or the bundesliga is bit more professional and farther along in development . "
less money from other sources only the top foreign clubs can even come close to making the sponsorship deals made in the bundesliga .
english champions fc chelsea were recently rumored to have made a record-breaking contract with the south korean electronics manufacturer samsung , but even that was n't enough to take over at the top , according to schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus turin cashes in on two jersey sponsors " no , chelsea is not first , it 's juventus turin , " he said .
" but they do have two jersey sponsors , one for the league and one for the champions league matches .

" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .

" such a horrible crime can not and must not be explained with generalizations of this kind , " said merkel , who is the first major contender for the chancellery to come from the depressed east , where schönbohm 's comments drew a hail of criticism . " i spoke with jörg schönbohm -lrb- who belongs to merkel 's christian democratic union party -rrb- and expect him to end this discussion as soon as possible . " schröder senses a scandal as election approaches chancellor gerhard schröder , sensing an opportunity to score points in a region where a new breakaway political grouping , the left party , has been gaining ground , said that schönbohm had " insulted the people of the east " with his " pseudo-psychology " and confused his historical facts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation was shocked to learn monday that a 39-year-old unemployed dental hygienist in brandenburg identified as sabine h. had been charged with killing nine of her newborn babies over an 11-year period and burying their remains in and around a storage shed . schönbohm apologized for his remarks friday but said he was trying to offer reasons why no one in her circle of friends , relatives and neighbors had noticed the astonishing cycle of pregnancies and deaths . comments come as majority lead decreases the strong lead enjoyed by merkel 's christian union alliance and her chosen coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , has slipped slightly in recent weeks , a drop which could rob them of a governing majority on election day .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- merkel has not helped matters with a series of blunders this week while explaining key planks of her economic program , leading the normally staid berlin daily tagesspiegel to splash the headline " it 's the economy , stupid ! " meanwhile , the east is considered to be a crucial battleground where shifts of a few percentage points could have an impact on the final outcome . the ex-communist states , with a population of about 16 million in a country of 82 million , are often seen by political scientists as a region where the national election can not necessarily be won but can certainly be lost . eastern germany an important battleground in other words , steep losses or strong gains in the east can tip the scales in a close vote , as they did in 2002 when schröder narrowly won re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder nach der abstimmung zur agenda 2010 bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder nimmt auf dem parteitag der spd im berliner hotel estrel am sonntag , 1 .

werner schnappauf said the beloved landmark would be only a shadow of itself without its white frosty cover , and said the development was a grim harbinger of things to come . " it has gotten up to two degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- warmer on average in the entire alpine region in the last 70 years , " he said , adding that on a hot day the schneeferner - one of two glaciers on zugspitze 's massif - lost up to 35 million liters -lrb- nine million gallons -rrb- of water . " that is the daily water use of augsburg , " a city of 276,000 . schnappauf made the comments on a visit to the zugspitze , elevation 2,962 meters -lrb- 9,718 feet -rrb- .
he said that winter sports companies would have to adapt to the changes as well , noting that in 2025 there would be about 25 fewer days per year when the temperature fell below the freezing point . that would mean that it would be too warm for alpine ski resorts to use snowmakers on such days , leading to a serious economic crunch for the tourism-dependent region . dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.08.2005 -pipe- 16:00 utc german industrial output jumps in june german industrial production rose by 1.4 percent in june , far exceeding estimates by analysts , owing to strength in the construction sector , adjusted data from the economy ministry showed on friday . analysts contacted by afx , the financial news subsidiary of afp , had expected growth of 0.3 percent .
economists interpreted the latest figures as further evidence of a firm undercurrent in the eurozone 's biggest economy .
industrial output had fallen by 0.4 percent in may and the economy ministry said that the surge in june reflected mainly activity in the building sector .
the data was published coincidentally at the same time as data from the organisation for economic cooperation and development in paris suggesting that leading indicators regarding likely future activity were turning upwards in the eurozone , notably due to rising indicators in germany . the german industrial data indicated that figures for the construction sector had risen by 4.7 percent in june , partly because the sector had caught up for time lost because of unfavorable weather in the winter and part of the spring .
output in may had declined by 1.9 percent . production of durable goods had risen by 3.5 percent .
in may and june together , industrial output had risen by 0.9 percent from the figure for march and april . economists said that the rise in june was an encouraging sign following several positive indicators . data on industrial orders in june , published on thursday , showed a monthly increase of 2.4 percent after a rise of 2.3 percent in may . data on wednesday had shown that sales of cars had risen by 2.0 percent in july .
this was seen as a good sign for consumption , a weak point in the german economy . dw-world.de economy set to dominate german election now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .
the numerous contenders in the bundesliga have now received their first message as to whom they must beat in this season .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .

" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .
17 summit - which approved starting accession talks with turkey - that the protocol would not amount to a recognition of cyprus . " unfortunately we are now seeing contradictory statements , " he added .

though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .

though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "

" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .

" it is out of the question for us to consider or talk about any new conditions regarding the accession process slated to begin on oct .
3 , " erdogan told reporters in ankara . in a new complication to ankara 's long-standing eu bid , french prime minister dominique de villepin said tuesday that turkey must recognize the republic of cyprus before it can begin membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin " it seems to me inconceivable that such a negotiation process can begin with a country which does not recognize every one of the members of the european union , that is to say the 25 , " villepin told europe one radio . the conservative french daily le figaro reported wednesday , citing unnamed government ministers , that french president jacques chirac had lent support to his prime minister 's position in a cabinet meeting . turkey refuses to endorse cyprus ' internationally-recognized greek cypriot government , which joined the eu last year . german opposition backs france leaders of germany 's opposition christian democratic union party said they backed france 's call . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedbert pflüger " villepin is right , " friedbert pflüger , the party 's foreign policy expert , told reuters .
" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .
17 summit - which approved starting accession talks with turkey - that the protocol would not amount to a recognition of cyprus . " unfortunately we are now seeing contradictory statements , " he added .
" this is really regrettable .

" it is out of the question for us to consider or talk about any new conditions regarding the accession process slated to begin on oct .

" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .
17 summit - which approved starting accession talks with turkey - that the protocol would not amount to a recognition of cyprus . " unfortunately we are now seeing contradictory statements , " he added .

" we have been saying for a long time that axel springer has two strategic growth options : accelerated internationalization of the print business or expansion in the german tv market , " said axel springer chairman and ceo mathias doepfner after the announcement was made . " with the acquisition of prosiebensat.1 , we are pursuing a unique opportunity and systematically implementing one of these options . " prosiebensat.1 chairman and ceo guillaume de posch was in an equally positive mood .
" in combination , both companies are well positioned to assume a strong competitive position and to pursue growth opportunities , particularly in the further diversification of the business . " he said .
" with axel springer it will be ensured that the successful corporate strategy and the broadcasting group model of prosiebensat.1 can be continued . " stoiber heralds a strengthening of the media sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber , leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , was among the first politicians to speak on the takeover and heralded the acquisition saying that the merger would be " an obvious strengthening of the media sector in germany . "
stoiber said that the move would not only secure existing jobs but provide new opportunities for germans by keeping the seat of one of europe 's media powerhouses in germany . fellow conservative günter nooke , the cdu / csu spokesperson for media and culture in the german parliament , also spoke of the stabilizing effect the merger would have on the currently fluid media landscape in germany , and in particular that of the capital if the newly expanded company set up base there .
" -lrb- the merger -rrb- would be an excellent and strong contribution to berlin as a media location , " nooke said . wolf-dieter ring , president of the bavarian center for new media , the organization in charge of commercial broadcasting in bavaria , welcomed the merger .
" this collaboration is a guarantee for long-term international competitiveness and the journalistic advancement of program quality . " journalists association fears " opinion monoploy " however , the creation of such a cross-media behemoth has caused major concern for some .
michael konken , chairman of germany 's association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- urged the german cartel office to block the merger , saying that it would be " disastrous " and would result in an " opinion monopoly " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konken said a 100 percent ownership of prosiebensat.1 will " have negative consequences on information and opinion purveyed to the public , something which does not conform to the ideals of a democratic state . " frank werneke , acting president of the ver.di trade union , echoed konken 's concerns about the merger infringing on the public choice and called for " the containment of media power across sector borders and a model of criteria for upholding the interests of the viewers . " some analysts see springer deal as smart move in the markets , however , there were reactions based firmly on the business sense of the deal with analysts predicting a glowing future for the merged media superpower . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " springer becomes an impressive and powerful force in the german and european media market , " said chris-oliver schickentanz , an analyst at dresdner bank in an interview with bloomberg .
" it will be easier for them to get big advertising accounts and they also will be able to heavily promote tv series in their print publications . " alexander mogg , a media consultant and partner at mercer management consulting in munich said , " in the mid- and long-term , the tv business probably also has more growth opportunities than the print business .
especially the young generation of consumers prefers visual media products , so springer is well advised to expand its tv business . " the takeover agreement is still subject to regulatory approval required under cartel law and media-supervision law in germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de springer buys control of prosiebensat.1 german publisher axel springer said friday it would buy a majority stake in prosiebensat.1 , germany 's largest tv group , in a 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.05 billion -rrb- deal to create the nation 's second-biggest media group .

though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "
jägermeister leads the way a liquor distillery in the north of germany paved the way to today 's jersey sponsoring opportunities .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors " when jersey sponsoring is taken as the sponsorship ruler to judge the leagues , the bundesliga comes in first with some 90 million euros , then comes either the english or italian league , both of which get around 60 million .
that 's a big difference , " schröder said .
" in this regard , germany or the bundesliga is bit more professional and farther along in development . "
less money from other sources only the top foreign clubs can even come close to making the sponsorship deals made in the bundesliga .
english champions fc chelsea were recently rumored to have made a record-breaking contract with the south korean electronics manufacturer samsung , but even that was n't enough to take over at the top , according to schröder .

" it is out of the question for us to consider or talk about any new conditions regarding the accession process slated to begin on oct .
3 , " erdogan told reporters in ankara . in a new complication to ankara 's long-standing eu bid , french prime minister dominique de villepin said tuesday that turkey must recognize the republic of cyprus before it can begin membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin " it seems to me inconceivable that such a negotiation process can begin with a country which does not recognize every one of the members of the european union , that is to say the 25 , " villepin told europe one radio . the conservative french daily le figaro reported wednesday , citing unnamed government ministers , that french president jacques chirac had lent support to his prime minister 's position in a cabinet meeting . turkey refuses to endorse cyprus ' internationally-recognized greek cypriot government , which joined the eu last year . german opposition backs france leaders of germany 's opposition christian democratic union party said they backed france 's call . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedbert pflüger " villepin is right , " friedbert pflüger , the party 's foreign policy expert , told reuters .
" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .

" the proposals are unacceptable , " nuclear negotiator hossein moussavian said , describing them as a " clear violation " of agreements between iran and the european union .
" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .
" we will in any event restart the isfahan conversion plant , " moussavian told afp . bildunterschrift : an aerial photo shows iran 's uranim conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , south of the capital tehran , iran , in this wednesday , march 30 , 2005 , file photo .
iran agreed late monday to a two-day delay in reopening its nuclear processing plant in isfahan after receiving a request from the head of the u.n. 's atomic watchdog agency .
the conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate , known as yellowcake , into uranium hexaflouride gas .
the gas is then taken to natanz and fed into the centrifuges for enrichment . enrichment plants ready to go back online he had also warned thursday that if the europeans called an iaea meeting , iran may not maintain its freeze on enrichment at the natanz plant . pozzo di borgo said that under the terms of the offer , the eu would guarantee a durable supply of nuclear fuel , and iran 's access to atomic technology for civilian purposes and the nuclear energy market . brussels would also promote trade , investment and technology transfers , work towards a trade and cooperation agreement , and support tehran 's accession to the world trade organization . it also promised to develop long-term scientific and technological cooperation in various areas , as well as helping with communications , education and training , transport , tourism and seismology . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

" they negate iran 's inalienable right , " he said . eu negotiators have called for an emergency meeting of the un watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , which could refer iran 's nuclear dossier to the security council for possible sanctions . but a defiant iran said it would also stick by its plans to resume uranium conversion , a preliminary stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , despite warnings that it would trigger an international crisis . the european union said tehran , accused by arch-enemy the united states of seeking to build an atomic bomb , must commit " not to pursue fuel cycle activities " if it wants to benefit from the eu incentives . stop activities and benefit from incentives , says eu the package , submitted by ambassadors from britain , france and germany , covers nuclear issues , political and security concerns , and offers economic and technological cooperation for iran to give up uranium enrichment work . it follows nine months of tortuous negotiations between the so-called eu-3 and iran , which in november agreed to suspend enrichment and conversion work for the duration of the talks .
the processes make fuel which can be used for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad the offer comes just days after iran 's new ultra-conservative president mahmood ahmadinejad took office , raising international concerns about the future policies of the islamic republic . french foreign ministry spokeswoman cecile pozzo di borgo said the eu recognizes " the inalienable right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in conformity with the npt and within the framework of a global accord . " iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to conduct nuclear activities for peaceful purposes . the issue is a matter of national pride in iran , which insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas , a vital source of hard currency . suspicious activity but no " smoking gun " it has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the iaea , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the world will face a " major international crisis " if iran does not accept the proposals .
" i hope iran will heed the voice of reason . "
but if iran resumes conversion , " then it is certain that the international community will ask the security council to intervene , " he said . moussavian said iran 's decision resume conversion - which turns uranium ore into a gas to be used in the enrichment process - at its isfahan plant was " irrevocable " despite the threat of possible sanctions .
" we will in any event restart the isfahan conversion plant , " moussavian told afp . bildunterschrift : an aerial photo shows iran 's uranim conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , south of the capital tehran , iran , in this wednesday , march 30 , 2005 , file photo .
iran agreed late monday to a two-day delay in reopening its nuclear processing plant in isfahan after receiving a request from the head of the u.n. 's atomic watchdog agency .
the conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate , known as yellowcake , into uranium hexaflouride gas .
the gas is then taken to natanz and fed into the centrifuges for enrichment . enrichment plants ready to go back online he had also warned thursday that if the europeans called an iaea meeting , iran may not maintain its freeze on enrichment at the natanz plant . pozzo di borgo said that under the terms of the offer , the eu would guarantee a durable supply of nuclear fuel , and iran 's access to atomic technology for civilian purposes and the nuclear energy market . brussels would also promote trade , investment and technology transfers , work towards a trade and cooperation agreement , and support tehran 's accession to the world trade organization . it also promised to develop long-term scientific and technological cooperation in various areas , as well as helping with communications , education and training , transport , tourism and seismology . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls for emergency un meeting on iran mahmoud ahmadinejad faces the possibility of being brought before the un 's nuclear watchdog in his first week as iran 's president after the eu called for emergency talks on the islamic republic 's atomic program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.08.2005 shirtfronts worth millions to sponsors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't throw that jersey - it 's worth millions !
though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "
jägermeister leads the way a liquor distillery in the north of germany paved the way to today 's jersey sponsoring opportunities .
for a mere 160,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 82,000 euros -rrb- , günter mast got a 14-centimeter -lrb- 5.5-inch -rrb- drawing of a deer on the front of then-bundesliga team eintracht braunschweig 's shirts in 1973 .
the stricter advertising rules of the day would n't allow the drink 's name , jägermeister , to be printed on the players ' jerseys .
from these modest beginnings that the bundesliga became europe 's sponsorship leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors " when jersey sponsoring is taken as the sponsorship ruler to judge the leagues , the bundesliga comes in first with some 90 million euros , then comes either the english or italian league , both of which get around 60 million .
that 's a big difference , " schröder said .
" in this regard , germany or the bundesliga is bit more professional and farther along in development . "
less money from other sources only the top foreign clubs can even come close to making the sponsorship deals made in the bundesliga .
english champions fc chelsea were recently rumored to have made a record-breaking contract with the south korean electronics manufacturer samsung , but even that was n't enough to take over at the top , according to schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus turin cashes in on two jersey sponsors " no , chelsea is not first , it 's juventus turin , " he said .
" but they do have two jersey sponsors , one for the league and one for the champions league matches .
if you can believe the press , they 're getting about 20 million euros . "
it may well be a case of making the best of a bad situation .

" such a horrible crime can not and must not be explained with generalizations of this kind , " said merkel , who is the first major contender for the chancellery to come from the depressed east , where schönbohm 's comments drew a hail of criticism . " i spoke with jörg schönbohm -lrb- who belongs to merkel 's christian democratic union party -rrb- and expect him to end this discussion as soon as possible . " schröder senses a scandal as election approaches chancellor gerhard schröder , sensing an opportunity to score points in a region where a new breakaway political grouping , the left party , has been gaining ground , said that schönbohm had " insulted the people of the east " with his " pseudo-psychology " and confused his historical facts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation was shocked to learn monday that a 39-year-old unemployed dental hygienist in brandenburg identified as sabine h. had been charged with killing nine of her newborn babies over an 11-year period and burying their remains in and around a storage shed . schönbohm apologized for his remarks friday but said he was trying to offer reasons why no one in her circle of friends , relatives and neighbors had noticed the astonishing cycle of pregnancies and deaths . comments come as majority lead decreases the strong lead enjoyed by merkel 's christian union alliance and her chosen coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , has slipped slightly in recent weeks , a drop which could rob them of a governing majority on election day .
germany is to go to the polls september 18 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oppositionsführerin angela merkel bei ihrer rede zur regierungserklärung von bundeskanzler gerhard schröder zum irak-krieg am donnerstag , 3 .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- - german conservative opposition leader angela merkel gestures during her speech following german chancellor gerhard schroeder 's policy statement on the iraq war in the berlin reichstag thursday , april 3 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- merkel has not helped matters with a series of blunders this week while explaining key planks of her economic program , leading the normally staid berlin daily tagesspiegel to splash the headline " it 's the economy , stupid ! " meanwhile , the east is considered to be a crucial battleground where shifts of a few percentage points could have an impact on the final outcome . the ex-communist states , with a population of about 16 million in a country of 82 million , are often seen by political scientists as a region where the national election can not necessarily be won but can certainly be lost . eastern germany an important battleground in other words , steep losses or strong gains in the east can tip the scales in a close vote , as they did in 2002 when schröder narrowly won re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder nach der abstimmung zur agenda 2010 bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder nimmt auf dem parteitag der spd im berliner hotel estrel am sonntag , 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.08.2005 shirtfronts worth millions to sponsors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't throw that jersey - it 's worth millions !
though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .
" but when a team , such as werder bremen two years ago , wins the championship and the german cup in the same year the jersey sponsor also pays bonuses , which can be very lucrative for the clubs . "
jägermeister leads the way a liquor distillery in the north of germany paved the way to today 's jersey sponsoring opportunities .
for a mere 160,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 82,000 euros -rrb- , günter mast got a 14-centimeter -lrb- 5.5-inch -rrb- drawing of a deer on the front of then-bundesliga team eintracht braunschweig 's shirts in 1973 .
the stricter advertising rules of the day would n't allow the drink 's name , jägermeister , to be printed on the players ' jerseys .
from these modest beginnings that the bundesliga became europe 's sponsorship leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors " when jersey sponsoring is taken as the sponsorship ruler to judge the leagues , the bundesliga comes in first with some 90 million euros , then comes either the english or italian league , both of which get around 60 million .
that 's a big difference , " schröder said .
" in this regard , germany or the bundesliga is bit more professional and farther along in development . "
less money from other sources only the top foreign clubs can even come close to making the sponsorship deals made in the bundesliga .
english champions fc chelsea were recently rumored to have made a record-breaking contract with the south korean electronics manufacturer samsung , but even that was n't enough to take over at the top , according to schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus turin cashes in on two jersey sponsors " no , chelsea is not first , it 's juventus turin , " he said .
" but they do have two jersey sponsors , one for the league and one for the champions league matches .
if you can believe the press , they 're getting about 20 million euros . "
it may well be a case of making the best of a bad situation .
as german clubs earn less and less from the sale of broadcasting rights - especially in comparison with other leagues - they have found sponsorship deals to be the best way of getting there hands on the needed cash . klaus ulrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer junkies prepare for bundesliga fix the 2005/06 bundesliga season kicks-off on friday .

" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .

though germany 's bundesliga may not always be considered one of the world 's top divisions , when it comes to signing up companies to put their logos on jerseys , the germans are at the forefront . german soccer is world class - at least when it comes to jersey sponsoring .
in exchange for pulling on advertisement-laden jerseys this season , over 90 million euros -lrb- $ 1.23 million -rrb- will flow into the 18 bundesliga teams ' coffers .
" one of the most successful bundesliga sponsors is volkswagen in wolfsburg , " said stephan schröder of the international trade journal sport und markt .
" the other is deutsche telekom , which is sponsoring bayern munich . "
each bundesliga team has between 15 and 20 sponsors , but it 's the sponsor with its name on the jersey that gets the most attention - and has to shell out the most money , according to schröder .
currently , deutsche telekom pays the bundesliga 's top rate by writing a 17-million-euro check to bayern .
more than just a jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn " in exchange , bayern munich offers their main sponsor quite a bit more than just some print on the jersey , " schröder said .
" for example the sponsor have the chance to advertise with the team at conferences and can take advantage of the popularity of players like michael ballack and oliver kahn . "
but not everyone can be as lucky as the reigning bundesliga champions . second place in the sponsoring race goes to borussia dortmund and their deal with the energy company e.on , whose 10 to 12 million euros should help the financially struggling team .
arminia bielefeld , fsv mainz and eintracht frankfurt , on the other hand , receive a miserly 2 to 2.5 million euros for the front of their shirts - even though they 're just as big as what the strikers in munich and dortmund are wearing .
but not all hope is lost for the teams on the lower rungs of the sponsorship ladder .
a stellar season can mean added income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's worth 17 million euros to the deutsche telekom to be associated with the bundesliga 's top team " all the bundesliga contracts have stipulations on basic sums that the teams can plan on , " schröder said .

" it is out of the question for us to consider or talk about any new conditions regarding the accession process slated to begin on oct .
3 , " erdogan told reporters in ankara . in a new complication to ankara 's long-standing eu bid , french prime minister dominique de villepin said tuesday that turkey must recognize the republic of cyprus before it can begin membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin " it seems to me inconceivable that such a negotiation process can begin with a country which does not recognize every one of the members of the european union , that is to say the 25 , " villepin told europe one radio . the conservative french daily le figaro reported wednesday , citing unnamed government ministers , that french president jacques chirac had lent support to his prime minister 's position in a cabinet meeting . turkey refuses to endorse cyprus ' internationally-recognized greek cypriot government , which joined the eu last year . german opposition backs france leaders of germany 's opposition christian democratic union party said they backed france 's call . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedbert pflüger " villepin is right , " friedbert pflüger , the party 's foreign policy expert , told reuters .
" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .
17 summit - which approved starting accession talks with turkey - that the protocol would not amount to a recognition of cyprus . " unfortunately we are now seeing contradictory statements , " he added .

" such a horrible crime can not and must not be explained with generalizations of this kind , " said merkel , who is the first major contender for the chancellery to come from the depressed east , where schönbohm 's comments drew a hail of criticism . " i spoke with jörg schönbohm -lrb- who belongs to merkel 's christian democratic union party -rrb- and expect him to end this discussion as soon as possible . " schröder senses a scandal as election approaches chancellor gerhard schröder , sensing an opportunity to score points in a region where a new breakaway political grouping , the left party , has been gaining ground , said that schönbohm had " insulted the people of the east " with his " pseudo-psychology " and confused his historical facts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation was shocked to learn monday that a 39-year-old unemployed dental hygienist in brandenburg identified as sabine h. had been charged with killing nine of her newborn babies over an 11-year period and burying their remains in and around a storage shed . schönbohm apologized for his remarks friday but said he was trying to offer reasons why no one in her circle of friends , relatives and neighbors had noticed the astonishing cycle of pregnancies and deaths . comments come as majority lead decreases the strong lead enjoyed by merkel 's christian union alliance and her chosen coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , has slipped slightly in recent weeks , a drop which could rob them of a governing majority on election day .

" meanwhile , the east is considered to be a crucial battleground where shifts of a few percentage points could have an impact on the final outcome . the ex-communist states , with a population of about 16 million in a country of 82 million , are often seen by political scientists as a region where the national election can not necessarily be won but can certainly be lost . eastern germany an important battleground in other words , steep losses or strong gains in the east can tip the scales in a close vote , as they did in 2002 when schröder narrowly won re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder nach der abstimmung zur agenda 2010 bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder nimmt auf dem parteitag der spd im berliner hotel estrel am sonntag , 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.08.2005 bayern throw down the gauntlet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't pretty , and it was n't easy for the defending champs bayern the 2005-06 season began just like the last one ended .
bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .
the numerous contenders in the bundesliga have now received their first message as to whom they must beat in this season .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .
gladbach , on the other hand , have had to do with just one german cup success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lucio -lrb- l -rrb- challenges borussia 's strike vaclav sverkos the opening game started off , in comparison to last year 's in bremen , on time , but it took time for the squads to play some attractive soccer for the 66,000 fans in munich 's new stadium .
" it 's a lot different in the new stadium , the atmosphere is a lot different and the fans are motivating , " said bayern keeper oliver kahn .
of course , the supporters were happy to be there but they had to watch soccer that would n't rank up there with a champions league final .
referee busy early referee manuel gräfe played a more central role than is desired in most matches in the first 30 minutes .
in an attempt to prevent a sometimes shoddy soccer match from spiraling downwards , he was quick to book offenders .
one of those booked , was bayern 's new inner defender , valerien ismael , for a hard and unnecessary challenge on gladbach striker oliver neuville .
this would later haunt the frenchman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's newest acquisition , defender valerien ismael , had a short game , being sent off in the 38th minute but first came the lead for bayern munich .
after looking harmless against a sturdy , confident gladbach defense , two quick , accurate passes .
hasan salihamidzic laid the ball nicely onto bayern striker roque santa cruz who from the goal line dropped it back to english national midfielder owen hargreaves who , standing alone , curled the ball past gladbach keeper casey keller in the 28th minute .
ten minutes later , gladbach 's neuville created a one-on-one situation against ismael .
a slight tug of the jersey and a push by ismael forced neuville down .
referee gräfe was quick to pull out yellow for the bayern defender ismael who received his marching orders for the second bookable offense .
bildunterschrift : oliver neuville -lrb- r -rrb- is brought down by valerien ismael , who would see the red card shaky second-half ends joyfully the second-half provided few highlights for the home crowd .
in fact , they were often on the edge of their seats as the one-man advantage for gladbach started paying off .
the highlight came in the 78th minute when 19-year-old marcell jansen , who was a thorn on the right side of the bayern defense for much of the match , beat two defenders and his shot from some 10 meters out glanced off the outside of the bayern post .
" we should have scored the equalizer , " gladbach captain jeff strasser said after the match .
which was true .
the gladbach opportunities were exhausted .
munich waited to counterattack and nobody is cooler at doing that than dutch striker roy makaay .
in the 86th minute , jens jeremies found the striker on a beautiful lob just over the head of strasser and makaay pounded the ball past keller .
three minutes later , the dutchman again sneaked behind the gladbach defenders , receiving a pass from martin dimichelis , and again keller could only watch as makaay beat him .
a deserved victory for coach felix magath 's team but maybe not a 3-goal win .
" the game was open until the second goal , " was his assessment .
a roy makaay can seal a match when it is still uncertain .
the numerous contenders in the bundesliga have now received their first message as to whom they must beat in this season .

"
dw 's uta thofern says that 's not something to hope for . " grand coalition " is a phrase that sounds promising , productive and harmonious for many germans , who still remember the time between 1966 and 1969 , when the first and only alliance of christian democrats and social democrats ruled the country on the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the great coalition do more for change in germany than student leaders such as rudi dutschke ?
things were n't that bad back then , some recollect .
indeed , the so-called black-red coalition probably did more to change the country than the supposedly revolutionary " generation 1968 , " which simply received more attention . back then , the grand coalition laid the foundation for germany 's societal liberalization , which was later completed by the coalition government of social democrats and free democrats that followed it .
black-red initiated a new policy approach towards the eastern bloc and made first steps towards modernizing the country 's system of government . what could be more enticing than a remake ?
relying on a definitely comfortable majority in parliament , such an alliance would be able to tackle the complete makeover germany so desperately needs .
it could happen without serious resistance from states nor painful blockades and endless discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would a new great coalition be able to avoid large-scale protests against social welfare reforms like the ones that took place in recent years ?
according to the latest polls , almost a third of voters is banking on a grand coalition and probably is n't just hoping for an end to party bickering but also softer reforms that are based on consensus and will be easier to bear as a result . a different country it 's all an illusion .
the sixties wo n't be coming back .
the leading politicians at the time , the christian democrat kurt georg kiesinger and the social democrat willy brandt , lived in a country , where unemployment was n't a problem and national debt was still a foreign word . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt -lrb- left -rrb- and kurt georg kiesinger -lrb- right -rrb- in 1966 germany was still a country were most people remained with one company until retirement and where childless couples were still considered doomed .
societal and political reforms in this long-gone federal republic were connected with social welfare kickbacks .
germany ca n't afford this any longer : it needs profound change , not soft compromise in the 21st century . additionally , a grand coalition is unlikely to bring an end to the current political standstill .
on the contrary : the gruelling debates that took place between germany 's christian democrat-controlled upper house and social democrat-controlled lower house of parliament would also continue during cabinet meetings . expanding the stalemate social democratic leaders who would succeed chancellor gerhard schröder and current party chair franz müntefering would also be unable to support serious reforms .
unlike during the 1960s , the party 's not on the upswing .
spd leaders would be caught between a populist opposition from the left and their duty to govern responsibly as part of a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would a great coalition simply cement the current stalemate ?
an alliance between cdu and spd could rely on a sound parliamentary majority , but it would n't be able to make clear decisions .
this would result in a watered-down reform program , which would only cost germany more precious time . sure , a broad-based reform coalition would be desirable in order to secure wide acceptance for necessary cuts .
but this would require all those involved to display a willingness to accept what 's necessary - something that does n't seem to be the case at the moment .
instead , germany 's voters and parties quite obviously still tend to indulge in collective self-delusion . uta thofern -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu / spd coalition bad news for economy economists assessing the possibility of a grand coalition of the spd and cdu in german government after the september election are concerned that such a coupling could spell more trouble for the economy .

bayern munich , playing their first bundesliga match in the allianz arena , come away with a 3-0 victory against an overmatched mönchengladbach . the 43rd bundesliga campaign started off as expected but bayern munich had to fight hard before leaving the field the clear winners , defeating mönchengladbach 3-0 .
yet the final score does n't reveal just how close it was the first 85 minutes as the defending champions , playing the last 50 minutes with just ten men , came up against a motivated gladbach .
combined , the two teams have won over half -lrb- 24 total -rrb- of the bundesliga 's 42 titles .
but since the end of the 1970 's , it has been bayern munich who have won title after title , german cup after german cup , becoming the best team in german soccer .

"
dw 's uta thofern says that 's not something to hope for . " grand coalition " is a phrase that sounds promising , productive and harmonious for many germans , who still remember the time between 1966 and 1969 , when the first and only alliance of christian democrats and social democrats ruled the country on the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the great coalition do more for change in germany than student leaders such as rudi dutschke ?
things were n't that bad back then , some recollect .
indeed , the so-called black-red coalition probably did more to change the country than the supposedly revolutionary " generation 1968 , " which simply received more attention . back then , the grand coalition laid the foundation for germany 's societal liberalization , which was later completed by the coalition government of social democrats and free democrats that followed it .
black-red initiated a new policy approach towards the eastern bloc and made first steps towards modernizing the country 's system of government . what could be more enticing than a remake ?
relying on a definitely comfortable majority in parliament , such an alliance would be able to tackle the complete makeover germany so desperately needs .
it could happen without serious resistance from states nor painful blockades and endless discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would a new great coalition be able to avoid large-scale protests against social welfare reforms like the ones that took place in recent years ?
according to the latest polls , almost a third of voters is banking on a grand coalition and probably is n't just hoping for an end to party bickering but also softer reforms that are based on consensus and will be easier to bear as a result . a different country it 's all an illusion .
the sixties wo n't be coming back .
the leading politicians at the time , the christian democrat kurt georg kiesinger and the social democrat willy brandt , lived in a country , where unemployment was n't a problem and national debt was still a foreign word . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt -lrb- left -rrb- and kurt georg kiesinger -lrb- right -rrb- in 1966 germany was still a country were most people remained with one company until retirement and where childless couples were still considered doomed .
societal and political reforms in this long-gone federal republic were connected with social welfare kickbacks .
germany ca n't afford this any longer : it needs profound change , not soft compromise in the 21st century . additionally , a grand coalition is unlikely to bring an end to the current political standstill .
on the contrary : the gruelling debates that took place between germany 's christian democrat-controlled upper house and social democrat-controlled lower house of parliament would also continue during cabinet meetings . expanding the stalemate social democratic leaders who would succeed chancellor gerhard schröder and current party chair franz müntefering would also be unable to support serious reforms .
unlike during the 1960s , the party 's not on the upswing .
spd leaders would be caught between a populist opposition from the left and their duty to govern responsibly as part of a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would a great coalition simply cement the current stalemate ?
an alliance between cdu and spd could rely on a sound parliamentary majority , but it would n't be able to make clear decisions .
this would result in a watered-down reform program , which would only cost germany more precious time . sure , a broad-based reform coalition would be desirable in order to secure wide acceptance for necessary cuts .
but this would require all those involved to display a willingness to accept what 's necessary - something that does n't seem to be the case at the moment .
instead , germany 's voters and parties quite obviously still tend to indulge in collective self-delusion . uta thofern -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu / spd coalition bad news for economy economists assessing the possibility of a grand coalition of the spd and cdu in german government after the september election are concerned that such a coupling could spell more trouble for the economy .

" such a horrible crime can not and must not be explained with generalizations of this kind , " said merkel , who is the first major contender for the chancellery to come from the depressed east , where schönbohm 's comments drew a hail of criticism . " i spoke with jörg schönbohm -lrb- who belongs to merkel 's christian democratic union party -rrb- and expect him to end this discussion as soon as possible . " schröder senses a scandal as election approaches chancellor gerhard schröder , sensing an opportunity to score points in a region where a new breakaway political grouping , the left party , has been gaining ground , said that schönbohm had " insulted the people of the east " with his " pseudo-psychology " and confused his historical facts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation was shocked to learn monday that a 39-year-old unemployed dental hygienist in brandenburg identified as sabine h. had been charged with killing nine of her newborn babies over an 11-year period and burying their remains in and around a storage shed . schönbohm apologized for his remarks friday but said he was trying to offer reasons why no one in her circle of friends , relatives and neighbors had noticed the astonishing cycle of pregnancies and deaths . comments come as majority lead decreases the strong lead enjoyed by merkel 's christian union alliance and her chosen coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , has slipped slightly in recent weeks , a drop which could rob them of a governing majority on election day .

" meanwhile , the east is considered to be a crucial battleground where shifts of a few percentage points could have an impact on the final outcome . the ex-communist states , with a population of about 16 million in a country of 82 million , are often seen by political scientists as a region where the national election can not necessarily be won but can certainly be lost . eastern germany an important battleground in other words , steep losses or strong gains in the east can tip the scales in a close vote , as they did in 2002 when schröder narrowly won re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder nach der abstimmung zur agenda 2010 bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder nimmt auf dem parteitag der spd im berliner hotel estrel am sonntag , 1 .

" it is out of the question for us to consider or talk about any new conditions regarding the accession process slated to begin on oct .
3 , " erdogan told reporters in ankara . in a new complication to ankara 's long-standing eu bid , french prime minister dominique de villepin said tuesday that turkey must recognize the republic of cyprus before it can begin membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin " it seems to me inconceivable that such a negotiation process can begin with a country which does not recognize every one of the members of the european union , that is to say the 25 , " villepin told europe one radio . the conservative french daily le figaro reported wednesday , citing unnamed government ministers , that french president jacques chirac had lent support to his prime minister 's position in a cabinet meeting . turkey refuses to endorse cyprus ' internationally-recognized greek cypriot government , which joined the eu last year . german opposition backs france leaders of germany 's opposition christian democratic union party said they backed france 's call . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedbert pflüger " villepin is right , " friedbert pflüger , the party 's foreign policy expert , told reuters .
" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .

" it is out of the question for us to consider or talk about any new conditions regarding the accession process slated to begin on oct .
3 , " erdogan told reporters in ankara . in a new complication to ankara 's long-standing eu bid , french prime minister dominique de villepin said tuesday that turkey must recognize the republic of cyprus before it can begin membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin " it seems to me inconceivable that such a negotiation process can begin with a country which does not recognize every one of the members of the european union , that is to say the 25 , " villepin told europe one radio . the conservative french daily le figaro reported wednesday , citing unnamed government ministers , that french president jacques chirac had lent support to his prime minister 's position in a cabinet meeting . turkey refuses to endorse cyprus ' internationally-recognized greek cypriot government , which joined the eu last year . german opposition backs france leaders of germany 's opposition christian democratic union party said they backed france 's call . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedbert pflüger " villepin is right , " friedbert pflüger , the party 's foreign policy expert , told reuters .
" it is indeed difficult to imagine that negotiations can start with a country that has not beforehand recognized every single member of the eu . " while britain 's eu presidency said recognition of all eu countries had not been made a condition for entry talks , a leading german politician disagreed . " to my recollection , the council decision was that a way be found so that turkey must recognize all eu members before the start of entry negotiations , " said wolfgang schäuble , the cdu 's expert on european affairs . german foreign ministry spokespeople declined to comment and referred the matter to the british eu presidency . ankara signs customs union last week , ankara signed a document extending an existing turkey-eu customs union accord to 10 new eu members , including cyprus , a crucial eu condition for the start of accession negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border crossing between the greek and turkish parts of cyprus in nikosia .
but it underlined in an attached unilateral declaration that the signing of the protocol does not amount to a formal recognition of the greek cypriot government . erdogan said he was disappointed by both villepin 's and chirac 's remarks especially because the french president had asserted in a telephone call after the eu 's dec .
17 summit - which approved starting accession talks with turkey - that the protocol would not amount to a recognition of cyprus . " unfortunately we are now seeing contradictory statements , " he added .

the indonesian arm of newmont mining corp and its top us executive there are accused of polluting an area near to a mine in the north sulawesi province .
they claim the allegations , which they deny , are disproved by a " substantial body of scientific evidence " .
richard ness faces a maximum ten-year jail sentence if convicted .
rare case newmont has faced accusations of pollution before , but never accompanied by criminal charges .
it is also a rare example of the indonesian government taking a foreign company to court .
newmont mining 's indonesian arm , newmont minahasa raya , and mr ness - the local firm 's president director - are accused of knowingly dumping waste on an island in the province , about 1,300 miles north east of jakarta .
the indonesian authorities claim local residents have suffered serious skin diseases and neurological disorders after being exposed to abnormally high levels of toxic metals including mercury and arsenic .
the firm , which began operations in the area in 1996 , says it has fully complied with environmental regulations relating to waste removal from the mine , which closed last year .
independent research it insists there is no credible scientific evidence pointing to any environmental pollution .
in its defence , the firm is expected to point to independent research - including a report commissioned by the world health organisation - arguing that no environmental damage was caused and that traces of heavy metal deposits found on villagers were within acceptable levels .
we have not done anything wrong richard ness , newmont minahasa raya prosecutors claim that the company dumped more than five million tons of pollutants into the water around buyat bay .
as well as calling witnesses suffering from alleged waste-induced illnesses , its case is expected to highlight a police report which said that metal traces found in the area were above national standards .
mr ness said he was " very confident " that the company would be cleared of negligence .
" we have not done anything wrong , " he told reporters on thursday .
in a statement published when charges were brought , newmont said it was confident that mr ness would be " exonerated " .
the trial follows the detention of five newmont employees last year in relation to allegations of illegal dumping .
an indonesian court subsequently ruled that the arrests were illegal .
foreign investment environmental campaigners have praised the government for bringing the case to trial .
buyat bay is about 1,300 miles northeast of jakarta " if companies follow environmental requirements they wo n't have to worry , " said raja siregar , from the lobby group walhi .
" if they do n't they will face a problem in the future . "
however , there are concerns that the trial could deter foreign investment in indonesia .
a separate civil suit , in which the government is suing the firm for damages of more than $ 130m , could be settled out of court .

in burma his job was to fly very low over the jungle to locate army positions - his unit soon became known as " the eyes of the 14th army " .
squadron leader pujji says that he was n't afraid to fly : " i think you can be a good pilot only if you 're not scared ... i wanted to fly and i did n't care if i died " .
friday 12 : the british internees we talk to drina leeson and doris hewitt .
now in their 70s , they were 15 and 13 when they were interned by the japanese in sumatra .
in the days before singapore fell to the japanese in february 1942 , the women and children of the ex-pat british communities , scrambled onto the last ships to leave the peninsular .
two of the ships were bombed and sunk .
drina was on one of them .
after days in the water the survivors struggled ashore onto banka island - and into the hands of the japanese .
doris 's ship was captured .
they spent three and a half years in various camps - and have remained friends ever since .

here the bbc news website takes a look at some of the plans in store .
in a side street off central london 's busy tottenham court road , a huge model of a future london stretches across the floor of the building centre .
stripped of the people , traffic , noise , crime and the weather , it offers a sanitised , bird 's eye view of what the english capital might look like in 20 years ' time .
while today 's london is reconstructed to scale in grey plastic , tomorrow 's skyscrapers , stadiums , hotels , flats and stations stand out in white .
these are some of the " mega developments " expected to transform london over the next two decades , as an estimated £ 100bn is spent during one of the biggest periods of change since victorian times .
to the east , where today tube lines and thames bridges peter out , there are noticeably more white bits .
areas hit by the post-war departure of manufacturing , industrial production and the decline of the docks , are to be reborn , as planners brace for the anticipated 800,000 increase in london 's population by 2016 .
the east end and beyond are at the heart of plans to house the city 's expanding population , host the 2012 olympics , and give the economy a shot in the arm .
and it 's not just those blocks on the map , which mark out developments with planning permission - other plans are in the pipeline for the east .
" there 's an awful lot happening in the east end and , i think , worryingly little in the west , " said new london architecture curator peter murray .
" it is the mayor 's policy to use development to regenerate the east , which does have large chunks of impoverished places . "
here are some of the developments expected to transform east london .
thames gateway said to be western europe 's biggest regeneration scheme , the thames gateway stretches over 311 sq miles - covering an area about half the size of london .
it runs from london 's lower lea valley , just miles from the city 's economic heartland , 40 miles east along the thames into essex and kent .
current thinking is to build 120,000 new homes in the area by 2016 , along with new schools , sports facilities , businesses , health centres , parks , and transport links , among other things .
with its 15 square miles of brownfield sites - former docks , warehouses , industrial and quarrying sites - it is seen as a prime development opportunity .
if done properly , prime minister tony blair has said the area could become an important link with europe and boost the country 's economy .
it would also make room for much of the anticipated population increase .
but there are many concerns about the plans ranging from the quality of housing planned , investment pledged , urban sprawl and the risk of flooding .
stratford city over the next 15 years a new metropolitan centre will be created in the east end .
stratford city was london 's largest planning application covering 1.2m sq metres of " largely derelict " land , two miles north of canary wharf .
more than 100 shops , three big department stores , cafes , schools , hotels , parks and health centres will be built .
a set of new urban districts will house an extra 11,000 residents and 30,000 workers .
it may also house some of the 2012 olympic athletes .
it will have a direct rail link to paris , thanks to its new station for the channel tunnel rail link and is earmarked as a stop for crossrail .
london 2012 just next to stratford city , plans for the 2012 olympic games are centred on a 500-acre site .
the olympic village will include accommodation for 16,000 people , the main stadium , an aquatic centre with two 50m pools , four indoor arenas , a velo park , hockey centre and another , temporary , arena .
after the games 3,600 flats will go on the market , some aimed at key workers , and most of the sports facilities will stay - supporters say they will also bring transport improvements , new trees and parks and the river lea will be cleaned up .
but some river users say some common land and trees will be lost and wildlife habitats threatened while hundreds of businesses on the marshgate lane trading estate are due to be bulldozed to make way for games .
biggest wind farm there are plans afoot to build the world 's biggest wind farm in the thames estuary , to the east of london , halfway between the kent and essex coasts .
the 270 turbines would be built over 152 sq miles -lrb- 245 sq km -rrb- on a sandbank , but should be practically out of sight as they would be 12 miles -lrb- 20km -rrb- off shore , linked by cables into the national grid 's transmission system in kent .
they could generate up to 1,000 megawatts of renewable electricity , enough to supply a quarter of london 's homes and help the government meet green targets .
but there have been some concerns about shipping and the fate of a population of rare red-throated divers , up to 7,000 of which use the sandbank as a winter feeding area .
if plans are approved , the wind farm could be in place by 2011 .
transport a public inquiry has begun into plans for the £ 455m six-lane toll bridge , the thames gateway bridge , which would link newham with greenwich .
the mayor thinks it a crucial part of getting people to travel to new thames gateway jobs and homes , but environmentalists and some local residents fear it will bring a massive increase in traffic .
crossrail , the multi-billion pound rail link from berkshire to essex through underground tunnels in london , would include stops at stratford and the isle of dogs , due to open in 2013 .
by 2007 stratford is expected to have its own international station , linking it to paris and to the revamped st pancras station in central london , thanks to the channel tunnel rail link .
and work is due to begin on the east london line extension - from dalston to croydon via crystal palace - in 2005 and finish by june 2010 .
later the plan is to extend it further north to highbury and islington and west to clapham junction .

and it 's not just those blocks on the map , which mark out developments with planning permission - other plans are in the pipeline for the east .
" there 's an awful lot happening in the east end and , i think , worryingly little in the west , " said new london architecture curator peter murray .
" it is the mayor 's policy to use development to regenerate the east , which does have large chunks of impoverished places . "
here are some of the developments expected to transform east london .
thames gateway said to be western europe 's biggest regeneration scheme , the thames gateway stretches over 311 sq miles - covering an area about half the size of london .
it runs from london 's lower lea valley , just miles from the city 's economic heartland , 40 miles east along the thames into essex and kent .
current thinking is to build 120,000 new homes in the area by 2016 , along with new schools , sports facilities , businesses , health centres , parks , and transport links , among other things .
with its 15 square miles of brownfield sites - former docks , warehouses , industrial and quarrying sites - it is seen as a prime development opportunity .
if done properly , prime minister tony blair has said the area could become an important link with europe and boost the country 's economy .
it would also make room for much of the anticipated population increase .
but there are many concerns about the plans ranging from the quality of housing planned , investment pledged , urban sprawl and the risk of flooding .
stratford city stratford city is among the most ambitious developments over the next 15 years a new metropolitan centre will be created in the east end .
stratford city was london 's largest planning application covering 1.2m sq metres of " largely derelict " land , two miles north of canary wharf .
more than 100 shops , three big department stores , cafes , schools , hotels , parks and health centres will be built .
a set of new urban districts will house an extra 11,000 residents and 30,000 workers .
it may also house some of the 2012 olympic athletes .
it will have a direct rail link to paris , thanks to its new station for the channel tunnel rail link and is earmarked as a stop for crossrail .
london 2012 the aquatic centre will be among developments in stratford just next to stratford city , plans for the 2012 olympic games are centred on a 500-acre site .
the olympic village will include accommodation for 16,000 people , the main stadium , an aquatic centre with two 50m pools , four indoor arenas , a velo park , hockey centre and another , temporary , arena .
after the games 3,600 flats will go on the market , some aimed at key workers , and most of the sports facilities will stay - supporters say they will also bring transport improvements , new trees and parks and the river lea will be cleaned up .
but some river users say some common land and trees will be lost and wildlife habitats threatened while hundreds of businesses on the marshgate lane trading estate are due to be bulldozed to make way for games .
biggest wind farm there are plans afoot to build the world 's biggest wind farm in the thames estuary , to the east of london , halfway between the kent and essex coasts .
the 270 turbines would be built over 152 sq miles -lrb- 245 sq km -rrb- on a sandbank , but should be practically out of sight as they would be 12 miles -lrb- 20km -rrb- off shore , linked by cables into the national grid 's transmission system in kent .
they could generate up to 1,000 megawatts of renewable electricity , enough to supply a quarter of london 's homes and help the government meet green targets .
but there have been some concerns about shipping and the fate of a population of rare red-throated divers , up to 7,000 of which use the sandbank as a winter feeding area .
if plans are approved , the wind farm could be in place by 2011 .
transport guide to the channel tunnel rail link , due to open in 2007 at-a-glance a public inquiry has begun into plans for the £ 455m six-lane toll bridge , the thames gateway bridge , which would link newham with greenwich .
the mayor thinks it a crucial part of getting people to travel to new thames gateway jobs and homes , but environmentalists and some local residents fear it will bring a massive increase in traffic .
crossrail , the multi-billion pound rail link from berkshire to essex through underground tunnels in london , would include stops at stratford and the isle of dogs , due to open in 2013 .
by 2007 stratford is expected to have its own international station , linking it to paris and to the revamped st pancras station in central london , thanks to the channel tunnel rail link .
and work is due to begin on the east london line extension - from dalston to croydon via crystal palace - in 2005 and finish by june 2010 .
later the plan is to extend it further north to highbury and islington and west to clapham junction .

here the bbc news website takes a look at some of the plans in store .
a glimpse of london 's future ?
in a side street off central london 's busy tottenham court road , a huge model of a future london stretches across the floor of the building centre .
stripped of the people , traffic , noise , crime and the weather , it offers a sanitised , bird 's eye view of what the english capital might look like in 20 years ' time .
while today 's london is reconstructed to scale in grey plastic , tomorrow 's skyscrapers , stadiums , hotels , flats and stations stand out in white .
these are some of the " mega developments " expected to transform london over the next two decades , as an estimated £ 100bn is spent during one of the biggest periods of change since victorian times .
to the east , where today tube lines and thames bridges peter out , there are noticeably more white bits .
areas hit by the post-war departure of manufacturing , industrial production and the decline of the docks , are to be reborn , as planners brace for the anticipated 800,000 increase in london 's population by 2016 .
a look at some of other " mega developments " from across the whole of london .
in pictures the east end and beyond are at the heart of plans to house the city 's expanding population , host the 2012 olympics , and give the economy a shot in the arm .
and it 's not just those blocks on the map , which mark out developments with planning permission - other plans are in the pipeline for the east .
" there 's an awful lot happening in the east end and , i think , worryingly little in the west , " said new london architecture curator peter murray .
" it is the mayor 's policy to use development to regenerate the east , which does have large chunks of impoverished places . "
here are some of the developments expected to transform east london .
thames gateway said to be western europe 's biggest regeneration scheme , the thames gateway stretches over 311 sq miles - covering an area about half the size of london .
it runs from london 's lower lea valley , just miles from the city 's economic heartland , 40 miles east along the thames into essex and kent .
current thinking is to build 120,000 new homes in the area by 2016 , along with new schools , sports facilities , businesses , health centres , parks , and transport links , among other things .
with its 15 square miles of brownfield sites - former docks , warehouses , industrial and quarrying sites - it is seen as a prime development opportunity .
if done properly , prime minister tony blair has said the area could become an important link with europe and boost the country 's economy .
it would also make room for much of the anticipated population increase .
but there are many concerns about the plans ranging from the quality of housing planned , investment pledged , urban sprawl and the risk of flooding .
stratford city stratford city is among the most ambitious developments over the next 15 years a new metropolitan centre will be created in the east end .
stratford city was london 's largest planning application covering 1.2m sq metres of " largely derelict " land , two miles north of canary wharf .
more than 100 shops , three big department stores , cafes , schools , hotels , parks and health centres will be built .

here the bbc news website takes a look at some of the plans in store .
a glimpse of london 's future ?
in a side street off central london 's busy tottenham court road , a huge model of a future london stretches across the floor of the building centre .
stripped of the people , traffic , noise , crime and the weather , it offers a sanitised , bird 's eye view of what the english capital might look like in 20 years ' time .
while today 's london is reconstructed to scale in grey plastic , tomorrow 's skyscrapers , stadiums , hotels , flats and stations stand out in white .
these are some of the " mega developments " expected to transform london over the next two decades , as an estimated £ 100bn is spent during one of the biggest periods of change since victorian times .
to the east , where today tube lines and thames bridges peter out , there are noticeably more white bits .
areas hit by the post-war departure of manufacturing , industrial production and the decline of the docks , are to be reborn , as planners brace for the anticipated 800,000 increase in london 's population by 2016 .
a look at some of other " mega developments " from across the whole of london .
in pictures the east end and beyond are at the heart of plans to house the city 's expanding population , host the 2012 olympics , and give the economy a shot in the arm .
and it 's not just those blocks on the map , which mark out developments with planning permission - other plans are in the pipeline for the east .
" there 's an awful lot happening in the east end and , i think , worryingly little in the west , " said new london architecture curator peter murray .
" it is the mayor 's policy to use development to regenerate the east , which does have large chunks of impoverished places . "
here are some of the developments expected to transform east london .
thames gateway said to be western europe 's biggest regeneration scheme , the thames gateway stretches over 311 sq miles - covering an area about half the size of london .
it runs from london 's lower lea valley , just miles from the city 's economic heartland , 40 miles east along the thames into essex and kent .
current thinking is to build 120,000 new homes in the area by 2016 , along with new schools , sports facilities , businesses , health centres , parks , and transport links , among other things .
with its 15 square miles of brownfield sites - former docks , warehouses , industrial and quarrying sites - it is seen as a prime development opportunity .
if done properly , prime minister tony blair has said the area could become an important link with europe and boost the country 's economy .
it would also make room for much of the anticipated population increase .
but there are many concerns about the plans ranging from the quality of housing planned , investment pledged , urban sprawl and the risk of flooding .
stratford city stratford city is among the most ambitious developments over the next 15 years a new metropolitan centre will be created in the east end .
stratford city was london 's largest planning application covering 1.2m sq metres of " largely derelict " land , two miles north of canary wharf .
more than 100 shops , three big department stores , cafes , schools , hotels , parks and health centres will be built .
a set of new urban districts will house an extra 11,000 residents and 30,000 workers .
it may also house some of the 2012 olympic athletes .
it will have a direct rail link to paris , thanks to its new station for the channel tunnel rail link and is earmarked as a stop for crossrail .
london 2012 the aquatic centre will be among developments in stratford just next to stratford city , plans for the 2012 olympic games are centred on a 500-acre site .
the olympic village will include accommodation for 16,000 people , the main stadium , an aquatic centre with two 50m pools , four indoor arenas , a velo park , hockey centre and another , temporary , arena .
after the games 3,600 flats will go on the market , some aimed at key workers , and most of the sports facilities will stay - supporters say they will also bring transport improvements , new trees and parks and the river lea will be cleaned up .
but some river users say some common land and trees will be lost and wildlife habitats threatened while hundreds of businesses on the marshgate lane trading estate are due to be bulldozed to make way for games .
biggest wind farm there are plans afoot to build the world 's biggest wind farm in the thames estuary , to the east of london , halfway between the kent and essex coasts .
the 270 turbines would be built over 152 sq miles -lrb- 245 sq km -rrb- on a sandbank , but should be practically out of sight as they would be 12 miles -lrb- 20km -rrb- off shore , linked by cables into the national grid 's transmission system in kent .
they could generate up to 1,000 megawatts of renewable electricity , enough to supply a quarter of london 's homes and help the government meet green targets .
but there have been some concerns about shipping and the fate of a population of rare red-throated divers , up to 7,000 of which use the sandbank as a winter feeding area .
if plans are approved , the wind farm could be in place by 2011 .

it claims eight out of 10 people carry no next-of-kin details - the same proportion that carry a mobile .
the idea is being promoted after rescue workers found the mobile phones of victims of the london bombings .
the in case of emergency -lrb- ice -rrb- campaign encourages people to store details under ' ice1 , ' ' ice2 ' and so on .
the welsh ambulance service nhs trust said if people adopt the idea , it could " assist patients , families and crews at a time of great distress " .
chief executive don page said : " the ice campaign is such a simple idea and yet very effective , " he said .
" i would urge anyone with a mobile phone to take a few minutes to follow this simple step - it could prove crucial in an emergency . "
it is a case of helping people in distress and getting the best and most correct information about a patient , and the best use out of a mobile phone war veteran simon weston welsh falklands veteran simon weston said : " i am thrilled that the welsh ambulance service and the welsh assembly government are backing the ice scheme .
" the scheme started in east anglia but can go anywhere and is not restricted to one mobile phone network .
" it is a case of helping people in distress and getting the best and most correct information about a patient , and the best use out of a mobile phone . "
the welsh assembly government believes the scheme could help at a time when " every second counts " .
deputy health minister john griffiths said : " spending time trying to contact the next of kin can delay the start of treatment .
