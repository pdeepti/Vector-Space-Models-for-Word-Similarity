there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .
schalke grab last gasp goal to qualify schalke 04 ended their rollercoaster season on a high with a 3-2 victory at sc freiburg on saturday to clinch second place and an automatic spot in next season 's champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after investing heavily in players schalke management demanded a spot in the money-spinning champions league and ralf rangnick 's side delivered with a tense win over freiburg .
ebbe sand scored in the sixth minute to put schalke on the right track but alexander iaschvili equalized five minutes later after a kind deflection off the post .
brazilian marcelo bordon then put schalke back in front on 55 minutes and netted again in the 89th minute after relegated freiburg had equalized for the second time .
schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .
" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .
hertha rue misses , join leverkusen in uefa cup hertha could have secured third place with a home win over hanover but were left ruing a string of missed chances in a 0-0 draw .

" they would not have powers of arrest but they would be there in a sort of bobby-on-the-beat role , " swift , also the association of chief police officers ' official responsible for soccer disorder told the guardian .
" they would offer a familiar presence and help increase communication with supporters . "

stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .

dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers to the strains of europe 's 80 's rock standard ' the final countdown ' , the cdu ’ s jürgen rüttgers enters and people rise from their chairs , applauding , while the sound system pumps the soft rock anthem throughout the hall .
it ’ s a bit like the emotionally charged party meetings in the united states .
and just like other political parties would , at such an event , the cdu is self-congratulatory . rüttgers ’ speech is what you ’ d expect of the candidate : strong criticism of the spd ’ s performance in the state of north rhine-westphalia , in the four decades since the cdu was last into power . significant numbers are unhappy with the spd a significant number of the 18 million people in north rhine-westphalia are unhappy .
unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .
but the state is also burdened with a large budget deficit .
schools and universities have no money .
and many shops , hospitals and factories have had to close down .
the people on the streets are frustrated . " i ’ ve got the feeling that there ’ s no progress at all in north rhine-westphalia , and that everything is getting worse , " says one disgruntled resident . things used to be different .
the geographical heart of north rhine-westphalia , the densely-populated ruhrgebiet , was once the industrial centre of germany .
the coal and steel industry characterised the region and its economy and landscape for decades , and it shaped the people living here . most of them were strong supporters of the spd .
it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .
but over the years , the majority of jobs in the coal and steel industry here have been cut .
now , only 40,000 miners are left - of what used to be more than 500,000 .
it ’ s a process of social transition that could make itself felt at the north rhine-westphalia elections . splinter groups formed by disillusioned socialists bildunterschrift : there are currently four parties in north rhine westphalia ’ s state parliament : the spd and the greens form the ruling coalition .
and in the opposition there ’ s the cdu and fdp – the free democratic party .
but many spd members are dissatisfied with their own party .
and recently , a splinter group - together with lobbyists and members of non-governmental organisations - formed a new party : the wasg .
but they ’ ve yet to make an impact . wasg stands for wahlalternative arbeit und soziale gerechtigkeit , a loose translation of which would be the alternative party for work and social equality .
but many people in north-rhine westphalia have no idea what the wasg is .
according to opinion polls , the wasg is unlikely to get more than 2 percent of the vote .
but wasg party members are optimistic , says top candidate jürgen klute : " we ’ ve found candidates for all of the 128 constituencies .
and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .

stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .

german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .

schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .

and it seems this time , tv is n't keeping him afloat . silvio berlusconi may nave immense political and media power , but it has n't been enough for italy 's billionaire prime minister .
when journalists bring to light unpleasant facts such as his association with the mafia , charges against him for bribing judges , and his tailor-made laws to get him and friends off the legal hook , he has n't liked it . in its april 28 , 2003 issue , the economist 's cover page read " why berlusconi is unfit to lead italy . "
journalist david lane wrote the article that chronicled many of berlusconi 's shady dealings .
the italian prime minister sued .
four years later , lane 's still involved in the lawsuit against the magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist struck again with their aug .
1 , 2003 title : " dear mr. berlusconi : a challenge to italy 's prime minister " lane , the author numerous damning articles on berlusconi , said italy 's leader does n't only lack understanding of the role of a critical press in a healthy democracy .
he also has been a disaster on the economic front .
even worse , lane said , berlusconi has wasted precious energy as a leader claiming he 's the victim of a political witch hunt . " he 's always maintained that the foreign press is in league with the centre-left opposition , " lane said .
" and despite the fact that the economist is a notoriously right-wing magazine , he seems to believe that we , in common with other newspapers and magazines from outside italy , are out to get him . "
" never , never , never … " in his first appearance as prime minister on public network , rai , which he now controls , he said the plot against him does n't stop with left wingers and the foreign press .
it includes , well , almost everyone .
" i 've always contended that there 's the official state and then a parallel state made up of powerful segments of society that are in the hands of the left , " berlusconi said .
" they include high schools , universities , newspapers , radios , television , judges , the constitutional court , and i 'll stop here simply to be charitable to my homeland .
some italians understand this , but the rest need to see this , too . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai logo berlusconi went even further , saying that with the exception of one newscaster , emilio fede , a notorious berlusconi cheerleader , his tv channels are unpartisan , and " there have never been attacks on my political rivals . " " it 's an amazing lie because berlusconi last year had important italian journalists , such as michele santoro , enzo biagi , fired from public television , " explained tommaso dibenedetti .
the columnist said berlusconi 's favorite method of silencing critics is by firing them .
but he 's also turned to the courts to put a chill on political debate . giovanni valentini , a journalist at rome 's la repubblica daily , is one of the many berlusconi is suing .
in the article in question , valentini identified the prime minister 's conflict of interest in pocketing $ 3 million -lrb- 3.8 million euros -rrb- from tv ads a year .
" do n't forget that he 's the strongest political man in europe , one thousand times richer than the american president , " valentini stressed .

back to first page back 2/2 got the power la repubblica is one of the few dailies that has dared to speak out against berlusconi .
one of the reasons it 's so outspoken is its owner , carlo dibenedetti , who once tried to buy italy 's second-largest publishing house , mondadore .
instead , berlusconi took control of it by bribing judges , david lane said .
but newspapers do n't have a great deal of influence on the italian public .
la repubblica and l 'unita , the two main papers openly critical of italy 's leader , have a combined circulation of less than 800,000 .
the real power lies in television .
berlusconi 's three privately owned channels are renowned for combining fluffy entertainment with fawning political talk shows .
this lightweight , fun and games combo has been key to swaying a lot of voters , said giovanni valentini .
" and we know that about 6 percent of the voters vote under the influence of television .
this 6 percent is about 3 million people , " valentini said .
" in the last political elections , we had about 600,000 votes between center-left and center-right .
this is the problem . "
voters not convinced but it may not be as big as critics have feared .
in april regional elections across the country voters voiced their widespread dissatisfaction with berlusconi and his government .
candidates from opposition parties swept into power in 11 out of 13 regions .
with national elections a year away , voters have shown they 're no longer so amenable to berlusconi 's self-serving laws and poor handling of the economy .
nor do they buy his recent explanation for the bad economic outlook - that italians do n't work hard enough and vacation to much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do italians spend to much time on holiday ?
even tv appearances are n't helping this time , according to tommaso dibenedetti .

but it 's not just a question of overexposure .
as giovanni valentini said , promotion only works if the product is good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.05.2005 bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 players celebrate qualifying for the champions league there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .
there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .
schalke grab last gasp goal to qualify schalke 04 ended their rollercoaster season on a high with a 3-2 victory at sc freiburg on saturday to clinch second place and an automatic spot in next season 's champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after investing heavily in players schalke management demanded a spot in the money-spinning champions league and ralf rangnick 's side delivered with a tense win over freiburg .
ebbe sand scored in the sixth minute to put schalke on the right track but alexander iaschvili equalized five minutes later after a kind deflection off the post .
brazilian marcelo bordon then put schalke back in front on 55 minutes and netted again in the 89th minute after relegated freiburg had equalized for the second time .
schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .
" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad .

and it seems this time , tv is n't keeping him afloat . silvio berlusconi may nave immense political and media power , but it has n't been enough for italy 's billionaire prime minister .
when journalists bring to light unpleasant facts such as his association with the mafia , charges against him for bribing judges , and his tailor-made laws to get him and friends off the legal hook , he has n't liked it . in its april 28 , 2003 issue , the economist 's cover page read " why berlusconi is unfit to lead italy . "
journalist david lane wrote the article that chronicled many of berlusconi 's shady dealings .
the italian prime minister sued .
four years later , lane 's still involved in the lawsuit against the magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist struck again with their aug .
1 , 2003 title : " dear mr. berlusconi : a challenge to italy 's prime minister " lane , the author numerous damning articles on berlusconi , said italy 's leader does n't only lack understanding of the role of a critical press in a healthy democracy .
he also has been a disaster on the economic front .
even worse , lane said , berlusconi has wasted precious energy as a leader claiming he 's the victim of a political witch hunt . " he 's always maintained that the foreign press is in league with the centre-left opposition , " lane said .
" and despite the fact that the economist is a notoriously right-wing magazine , he seems to believe that we , in common with other newspapers and magazines from outside italy , are out to get him . "
" never , never , never … " in his first appearance as prime minister on public network , rai , which he now controls , he said the plot against him does n't stop with left wingers and the foreign press .
it includes , well , almost everyone .
" i 've always contended that there 's the official state and then a parallel state made up of powerful segments of society that are in the hands of the left , " berlusconi said .
" they include high schools , universities , newspapers , radios , television , judges , the constitutional court , and i 'll stop here simply to be charitable to my homeland .
some italians understand this , but the rest need to see this , too . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai logo berlusconi went even further , saying that with the exception of one newscaster , emilio fede , a notorious berlusconi cheerleader , his tv channels are unpartisan , and " there have never been attacks on my political rivals . " " it 's an amazing lie because berlusconi last year had important italian journalists , such as michele santoro , enzo biagi , fired from public television , " explained tommaso dibenedetti .
the columnist said berlusconi 's favorite method of silencing critics is by firing them .
but he 's also turned to the courts to put a chill on political debate . giovanni valentini , a journalist at rome 's la repubblica daily , is one of the many berlusconi is suing .
in the article in question , valentini identified the prime minister 's conflict of interest in pocketing $ 3 million -lrb- 3.8 million euros -rrb- from tv ads a year .
" do n't forget that he 's the strongest political man in europe , one thousand times richer than the american president , " valentini stressed .

back to first page back 2/2 got the power la repubblica is one of the few dailies that has dared to speak out against berlusconi .
one of the reasons it 's so outspoken is its owner , carlo dibenedetti , who once tried to buy italy 's second-largest publishing house , mondadore .
instead , berlusconi took control of it by bribing judges , david lane said .
but newspapers do n't have a great deal of influence on the italian public .
la repubblica and l 'unita , the two main papers openly critical of italy 's leader , have a combined circulation of less than 800,000 .
the real power lies in television .
berlusconi 's three privately owned channels are renowned for combining fluffy entertainment with fawning political talk shows .
this lightweight , fun and games combo has been key to swaying a lot of voters , said giovanni valentini .
" and we know that about 6 percent of the voters vote under the influence of television .
this 6 percent is about 3 million people , " valentini said .
" in the last political elections , we had about 600,000 votes between center-left and center-right .
this is the problem . "
voters not convinced but it may not be as big as critics have feared .
in april regional elections across the country voters voiced their widespread dissatisfaction with berlusconi and his government .
candidates from opposition parties swept into power in 11 out of 13 regions .
with national elections a year away , voters have shown they 're no longer so amenable to berlusconi 's self-serving laws and poor handling of the economy .
nor do they buy his recent explanation for the bad economic outlook - that italians do n't work hard enough and vacation to much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do italians spend to much time on holiday ?
even tv appearances are n't helping this time , according to tommaso dibenedetti .
" berlusconi is now over-exposed .
and his credibility is really , really weak . "
but it 's not just a question of overexposure .
as giovanni valentini said , promotion only works if the product is good .
" but when the product is old , is not good , is bad , television is not enough . "
and now that italians are feeling the pinch in their pocketbooks , it seems they may be ready to change the channel . megan williams , rome -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi forms new government italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a new government saturday , leaving key ministries untouched while bringing in his longtime ally and former economy minister giulio tremonti as deputy premier .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .

he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .

for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance . supporters of english soccer traveling abroad have long been accustomed to escorts by plainclothes british officers .
soon , they could have the feeling of being a little more at home when they travel to germany for next year 's world cup .
after talks with their german counterparts this week at the british embassy in berlin , british police officials are leaning towards sending uniformed police officers abroad for the first time .
david swift , the deputy chief constable of staffordshire believes recognizable policemen and women will help to defuse potential trouble .
" they would not have powers of arrest but they would be there in a sort of bobby-on-the-beat role , " swift , also the association of chief police officers ' official responsible for soccer disorder told the guardian .
" they would offer a familiar presence and help increase communication with supporters . "
an ounce of prevention police and security officials will take every precaution necessary in preventing violence between british and german fans .
about 3,000 blacklisted english supporters must surrender their passports ahead of world cup games according to information given the times .
overall , up to 80,000 england fans are expected to come to germany for the tournament .

in addition , the british foreign office will spend an additional 500,000 british pounds -lrb- 725,000 euros -rrb- to beef up its consular operation in germany .
with strong security measures in and around the stadiums , many are more concerned about what could happen at public venues , where hundreds of fans can gather to watch the game .
one official told the the times that german hooligans , most of whom wo n't get tickets , could pick fights while drinking in public in front of any one of the thousands of big screen televisions that will be set up in bars across the country .
large scenes of hooligans rioting in berlin would blemish the cup 's image immensely , something german police officials are all too aware of .
" billions of people will be watching the cup .
we have to do everything to make it work , " said gottrick wewer , of the german interior ministry .
foundation betters ties communication between the sides at all levels and at all points of contact could help .
german police and taxi drivers are supposed to learn english .
wewer told the guardian that the success of dealing with potentially violent fans at the euro 2004 in portugal should be a lesson to germany as well .
a low-key , but strong , police presence should lower the possibility of violence between england and germany supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legendary manchester city goalie , bernd " bert " trautmann , epitomizes peaceful relations between english and german soccer the bernd trautmann foundation , named after the legendary german goalkeeper at manchester city in the 1950 's , when the effects of world war ii were still omnipresent , looks to smooth out tensions between germans and english .
" we want to offer events in a world cup project that bring people together , " said matthias paskowsky , chairman of the foundation .
" our focus is on english fans and we want to make them feel particularly welcome . "
german interior minister otto schily does not want to leave any stone unturned though .
the fun for fans should n't be reduced by excessive security measures he said recently but hooligans can expect a zero tolerance strategy .
on may 25 , schily and the interior ministers of the 16 federal states will meet in stuttgart to hammer out a final plan so that in all 12 world cup cities , hooliganism will not be able to set root . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's english problem as berlin hopes to further boost foreign tourism ahead of the 2006 world cup , an undercover report by dw-world 's sonia phalnikar suggests that lacking language skills in the service sector might be the biggest problem .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .

back to first page back 2/2 got the power la repubblica is one of the few dailies that has dared to speak out against berlusconi .
one of the reasons it 's so outspoken is its owner , carlo dibenedetti , who once tried to buy italy 's second-largest publishing house , mondadore .
instead , berlusconi took control of it by bribing judges , david lane said .
but newspapers do n't have a great deal of influence on the italian public .
la repubblica and l 'unita , the two main papers openly critical of italy 's leader , have a combined circulation of less than 800,000 .
the real power lies in television .
berlusconi 's three privately owned channels are renowned for combining fluffy entertainment with fawning political talk shows .
this lightweight , fun and games combo has been key to swaying a lot of voters , said giovanni valentini .
" and we know that about 6 percent of the voters vote under the influence of television .
this 6 percent is about 3 million people , " valentini said .
" in the last political elections , we had about 600,000 votes between center-left and center-right .
this is the problem . "
voters not convinced but it may not be as big as critics have feared .
in april regional elections across the country voters voiced their widespread dissatisfaction with berlusconi and his government .
candidates from opposition parties swept into power in 11 out of 13 regions .
with national elections a year away , voters have shown they 're no longer so amenable to berlusconi 's self-serving laws and poor handling of the economy .
nor do they buy his recent explanation for the bad economic outlook - that italians do n't work hard enough and vacation to much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do italians spend to much time on holiday ?
even tv appearances are n't helping this time , according to tommaso dibenedetti .
" berlusconi is now over-exposed .
and his credibility is really , really weak . "
but it 's not just a question of overexposure .
as giovanni valentini said , promotion only works if the product is good .
" but when the product is old , is not good , is bad , television is not enough . "
and now that italians are feeling the pinch in their pocketbooks , it seems they may be ready to change the channel . megan williams , rome -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi forms new government italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a new government saturday , leaving key ministries untouched while bringing in his longtime ally and former economy minister giulio tremonti as deputy premier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.05.2005 bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 players celebrate qualifying for the champions league there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .
there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .
schalke grab last gasp goal to qualify schalke 04 ended their rollercoaster season on a high with a 3-2 victory at sc freiburg on saturday to clinch second place and an automatic spot in next season 's champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after investing heavily in players schalke management demanded a spot in the money-spinning champions league and ralf rangnick 's side delivered with a tense win over freiburg .
ebbe sand scored in the sixth minute to put schalke on the right track but alexander iaschvili equalized five minutes later after a kind deflection off the post .
brazilian marcelo bordon then put schalke back in front on 55 minutes and netted again in the 89th minute after relegated freiburg had equalized for the second time .
schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .
" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league .

stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .

german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .

there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .
schalke grab last gasp goal to qualify schalke 04 ended their rollercoaster season on a high with a 3-2 victory at sc freiburg on saturday to clinch second place and an automatic spot in next season 's champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after investing heavily in players schalke management demanded a spot in the money-spinning champions league and ralf rangnick 's side delivered with a tense win over freiburg .
ebbe sand scored in the sixth minute to put schalke on the right track but alexander iaschvili equalized five minutes later after a kind deflection off the post .
brazilian marcelo bordon then put schalke back in front on 55 minutes and netted again in the 89th minute after relegated freiburg had equalized for the second time .
schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .
" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .

1 , 2003 title : " dear mr. berlusconi : a challenge to italy 's prime minister " lane , the author numerous damning articles on berlusconi , said italy 's leader does n't only lack understanding of the role of a critical press in a healthy democracy .
he also has been a disaster on the economic front .
even worse , lane said , berlusconi has wasted precious energy as a leader claiming he 's the victim of a political witch hunt . " he 's always maintained that the foreign press is in league with the centre-left opposition , " lane said .
" and despite the fact that the economist is a notoriously right-wing magazine , he seems to believe that we , in common with other newspapers and magazines from outside italy , are out to get him . "
" never , never , never … " in his first appearance as prime minister on public network , rai , which he now controls , he said the plot against him does n't stop with left wingers and the foreign press .

" i 've always contended that there 's the official state and then a parallel state made up of powerful segments of society that are in the hands of the left , " berlusconi said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai logo berlusconi went even further , saying that with the exception of one newscaster , emilio fede , a notorious berlusconi cheerleader , his tv channels are unpartisan , and " there have never been attacks on my political rivals . " " it 's an amazing lie because berlusconi last year had important italian journalists , such as michele santoro , enzo biagi , fired from public television , " explained tommaso dibenedetti .
the columnist said berlusconi 's favorite method of silencing critics is by firing them .
but he 's also turned to the courts to put a chill on political debate . giovanni valentini , a journalist at rome 's la repubblica daily , is one of the many berlusconi is suing .
in the article in question , valentini identified the prime minister 's conflict of interest in pocketing $ 3 million -lrb- 3.8 million euros -rrb- from tv ads a year .
" do n't forget that he 's the strongest political man in europe , one thousand times richer than the american president , " valentini stressed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.05.2005 fear and confusion on the campaign trail back to first page back 2/2 at the last state elections in 2000 , more than 40 percent of the electorate didn ’ t vote , which was an increase of 26 percent on 30 years ago .
the number of non-voters in the state has become so significant that it could have an impact on the final election result in north rhine-westphalia .
opinion polls have shown the cdu to be ahead of the spd for weeks .
but the spd is slowly catching up again .
so , it could be a neck-to-neck race - in which case , every vote will count .
and the parties are fighting for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election campaign has given rise to the first political tv-duel in the history of state elections in germany .
state premier peer steinbrück , of the spd , and his cdu rival jürgen rüttgers , have been invited to go head-to-head live on tv - more than once . at times , the debate has been lively , and sometimes heated .
but the main topics remain : the state budget , unemployment figures , education , and , of course , energy issues and the future of coal mining . media circus causes mixed feelings in electorate for the people of north rhine-westphalia , such media events are a mixed affair .
" it is interesting to see both candidates confronting each other and answering the questions .
i think that ’ s a good thing , " says one lady .
" and i think that people who are not so familiar with politics can get to know the candidates better , and can then come to a decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i believe that if people are really interested in politics , they don ’ t need tv debates .
but since – unfortunately - this is a modern election campaign , it ’ s a typical thing to do , " a male viewer comments .
" but i ’ m sceptical .
if you want to get good information , you have to read the party manifestos .
that ’ s much better . " but not many voters read party manifestos .
and according to political analysts , tv-duels , and similar media events , could have an impact on the outcome of the election .
this explains why the cdu has been accused of using another recent media event , at national level to target votes .
it was a parliamentary inquiry into germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer , and his ministry , which was broadcast live on tv . cdu accused of employing opportunistic tactics the inquiry which was headed by the cdu claimed that the federal government ’ s visa policy was too liberal and had caused an influx of criminals into germany .
but just how influential the inquiry will be is unclear .
richard hilmer , managing director of the think tank infratest-dimap has dismissed concerns : " the topic won ’ t harm the reputation of the red-green government .
in fact , i don ’ t think the spd or the greens will face a setback . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering regardless of that , the spd ’ s party chief , franz müntefering , has launched a counter attack .
he ’ s criticised international businesses and their bosses , describing their practises as asocial and unfair .
he even compared foreign investors to a swarm of locusts .
and it ’ s sparked a massive public reaction – dubbed ‘ the capitalism debate ’ . ' locust ' outburst respected but suspicions remain " it ’ s true , in fact , that a large majority of the population supports his criticism , " hilmer adds , " even traditional cdu / csu and fdp supporters .
but people are suspicious of his timing : five weeks before the election , at a time , when the spd isn ’ t doing too well .
a large majority sees the debate as political tactics before the election . " but the state election in north rhine-westphalia continues to draw unprecedented attention from federal politicians because this is the last state governed by the spd-green party coalition .
if it loses its majority here , it will send aftershocks to berlin and seriously damage the national red-green coalition of chancellor gerhard schröder .
a feeling shared on the streets : " i think the election in north rhine-westphalia will have a great impact on the federal parliamentary elections in 2006 , " says one woman .
" if there ’ s a change of power here , i think that would give a new momentum to the federal elections . " a mood for change may be misread so , people across germany will be watching closely .
but as richard hilmer reminds , the election is not over until the last vote is cast : " there is definitely a mood for change .
but i would be careful to say that the election is already over .
because in the polls ahead of the elections in the state of schleswig-holstein , in february , we saw that the ruling party was way ahead until one week before the election .
but in the end it was defeated . " in that election , the spd ’ s heidi simonis , lost her seat - and then her job .
that is a series of events that spd politicians in north-rhine westphalia will be eager to avoid . svenja üing -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hits trail to save key election german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was to make a last-ditch effort to help his social democratic party hold onto power in the key state of north rhine-westphalia in elections sunday .

for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance . supporters of english soccer traveling abroad have long been accustomed to escorts by plainclothes british officers .
soon , they could have the feeling of being a little more at home when they travel to germany for next year 's world cup .
after talks with their german counterparts this week at the british embassy in berlin , british police officials are leaning towards sending uniformed police officers abroad for the first time .
david swift , the deputy chief constable of staffordshire believes recognizable policemen and women will help to defuse potential trouble .
" they would not have powers of arrest but they would be there in a sort of bobby-on-the-beat role , " swift , also the association of chief police officers ' official responsible for soccer disorder told the guardian .
" they would offer a familiar presence and help increase communication with supporters . "
an ounce of prevention police and security officials will take every precaution necessary in preventing violence between british and german fans .
about 3,000 blacklisted english supporters must surrender their passports ahead of world cup games according to information given the times .
overall , up to 80,000 england fans are expected to come to germany for the tournament .

in addition , the british foreign office will spend an additional 500,000 british pounds -lrb- 725,000 euros -rrb- to beef up its consular operation in germany .
with strong security measures in and around the stadiums , many are more concerned about what could happen at public venues , where hundreds of fans can gather to watch the game .
one official told the the times that german hooligans , most of whom wo n't get tickets , could pick fights while drinking in public in front of any one of the thousands of big screen televisions that will be set up in bars across the country .
large scenes of hooligans rioting in berlin would blemish the cup 's image immensely , something german police officials are all too aware of .
" billions of people will be watching the cup .
we have to do everything to make it work , " said gottrick wewer , of the german interior ministry .
foundation betters ties communication between the sides at all levels and at all points of contact could help .
german police and taxi drivers are supposed to learn english .
wewer told the guardian that the success of dealing with potentially violent fans at the euro 2004 in portugal should be a lesson to germany as well .
a low-key , but strong , police presence should lower the possibility of violence between england and germany supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legendary manchester city goalie , bernd " bert " trautmann , epitomizes peaceful relations between english and german soccer the bernd trautmann foundation , named after the legendary german goalkeeper at manchester city in the 1950 's , when the effects of world war ii were still omnipresent , looks to smooth out tensions between germans and english .
" we want to offer events in a world cup project that bring people together , " said matthias paskowsky , chairman of the foundation .
" our focus is on english fans and we want to make them feel particularly welcome . "
german interior minister otto schily does not want to leave any stone unturned though .
the fun for fans should n't be reduced by excessive security measures he said recently but hooligans can expect a zero tolerance strategy .
on may 25 , schily and the interior ministers of the 16 federal states will meet in stuttgart to hammer out a final plan so that in all 12 world cup cities , hooliganism will not be able to set root . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's english problem as berlin hopes to further boost foreign tourism ahead of the 2006 world cup , an undercover report by dw-world 's sonia phalnikar suggests that lacking language skills in the service sector might be the biggest problem .

there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .
schalke grab last gasp goal to qualify schalke 04 ended their rollercoaster season on a high with a 3-2 victory at sc freiburg on saturday to clinch second place and an automatic spot in next season 's champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after investing heavily in players schalke management demanded a spot in the money-spinning champions league and ralf rangnick 's side delivered with a tense win over freiburg .
ebbe sand scored in the sixth minute to put schalke on the right track but alexander iaschvili equalized five minutes later after a kind deflection off the post .
brazilian marcelo bordon then put schalke back in front on 55 minutes and netted again in the 89th minute after relegated freiburg had equalized for the second time .
schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .
" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .
hertha rue misses , join leverkusen in uefa cup hertha could have secured third place with a home win over hanover but were left ruing a string of missed chances in a 0-0 draw .

" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.05.2005 fear and confusion on the campaign trail back to first page back 2/2 at the last state elections in 2000 , more than 40 percent of the electorate didn ’ t vote , which was an increase of 26 percent on 30 years ago .
the number of non-voters in the state has become so significant that it could have an impact on the final election result in north rhine-westphalia .
opinion polls have shown the cdu to be ahead of the spd for weeks .
but the spd is slowly catching up again .
so , it could be a neck-to-neck race - in which case , every vote will count .
and the parties are fighting for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election campaign has given rise to the first political tv-duel in the history of state elections in germany .
state premier peer steinbrück , of the spd , and his cdu rival jürgen rüttgers , have been invited to go head-to-head live on tv - more than once . at times , the debate has been lively , and sometimes heated .
but the main topics remain : the state budget , unemployment figures , education , and , of course , energy issues and the future of coal mining . media circus causes mixed feelings in electorate for the people of north rhine-westphalia , such media events are a mixed affair .
" it is interesting to see both candidates confronting each other and answering the questions .
i think that ’ s a good thing , " says one lady .
" and i think that people who are not so familiar with politics can get to know the candidates better , and can then come to a decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i believe that if people are really interested in politics , they don ’ t need tv debates .
but since – unfortunately - this is a modern election campaign , it ’ s a typical thing to do , " a male viewer comments .
" but i ’ m sceptical .
if you want to get good information , you have to read the party manifestos .
that ’ s much better . " but not many voters read party manifestos .
and according to political analysts , tv-duels , and similar media events , could have an impact on the outcome of the election .
this explains why the cdu has been accused of using another recent media event , at national level to target votes .
it was a parliamentary inquiry into germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer , and his ministry , which was broadcast live on tv . cdu accused of employing opportunistic tactics the inquiry which was headed by the cdu claimed that the federal government ’ s visa policy was too liberal and had caused an influx of criminals into germany .
but just how influential the inquiry will be is unclear .
richard hilmer , managing director of the think tank infratest-dimap has dismissed concerns : " the topic won ’ t harm the reputation of the red-green government .
in fact , i don ’ t think the spd or the greens will face a setback . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering regardless of that , the spd ’ s party chief , franz müntefering , has launched a counter attack .
he ’ s criticised international businesses and their bosses , describing their practises as asocial and unfair .
he even compared foreign investors to a swarm of locusts .
and it ’ s sparked a massive public reaction – dubbed ‘ the capitalism debate ’ . ' locust ' outburst respected but suspicions remain " it ’ s true , in fact , that a large majority of the population supports his criticism , " hilmer adds , " even traditional cdu / csu and fdp supporters .
but people are suspicious of his timing : five weeks before the election , at a time , when the spd isn ’ t doing too well .
a large majority sees the debate as political tactics before the election . " but the state election in north rhine-westphalia continues to draw unprecedented attention from federal politicians because this is the last state governed by the spd-green party coalition .
if it loses its majority here , it will send aftershocks to berlin and seriously damage the national red-green coalition of chancellor gerhard schröder .
a feeling shared on the streets : " i think the election in north rhine-westphalia will have a great impact on the federal parliamentary elections in 2006 , " says one woman .
" if there ’ s a change of power here , i think that would give a new momentum to the federal elections . " a mood for change may be misread so , people across germany will be watching closely .
but as richard hilmer reminds , the election is not over until the last vote is cast : " there is definitely a mood for change .
but i would be careful to say that the election is already over .
because in the polls ahead of the elections in the state of schleswig-holstein , in february , we saw that the ruling party was way ahead until one week before the election .
but in the end it was defeated . " in that election , the spd ’ s heidi simonis , lost her seat - and then her job .
that is a series of events that spd politicians in north-rhine westphalia will be eager to avoid . svenja üing -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hits trail to save key election german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was to make a last-ditch effort to help his social democratic party hold onto power in the key state of north rhine-westphalia in elections sunday .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- spd facing state election blow german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats appear to be heading for a potentially devastating defeat in a regional election in the industrial state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

back to first page back 2/2 got the power la repubblica is one of the few dailies that has dared to speak out against berlusconi .
one of the reasons it 's so outspoken is its owner , carlo dibenedetti , who once tried to buy italy 's second-largest publishing house , mondadore .
instead , berlusconi took control of it by bribing judges , david lane said .
but newspapers do n't have a great deal of influence on the italian public .
la repubblica and l 'unita , the two main papers openly critical of italy 's leader , have a combined circulation of less than 800,000 .
the real power lies in television .
berlusconi 's three privately owned channels are renowned for combining fluffy entertainment with fawning political talk shows .
this lightweight , fun and games combo has been key to swaying a lot of voters , said giovanni valentini .
" and we know that about 6 percent of the voters vote under the influence of television .
this 6 percent is about 3 million people , " valentini said .
" in the last political elections , we had about 600,000 votes between center-left and center-right .
this is the problem . "
voters not convinced but it may not be as big as critics have feared .
in april regional elections across the country voters voiced their widespread dissatisfaction with berlusconi and his government .
candidates from opposition parties swept into power in 11 out of 13 regions .
with national elections a year away , voters have shown they 're no longer so amenable to berlusconi 's self-serving laws and poor handling of the economy .
nor do they buy his recent explanation for the bad economic outlook - that italians do n't work hard enough and vacation to much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do italians spend to much time on holiday ?
even tv appearances are n't helping this time , according to tommaso dibenedetti .
" berlusconi is now over-exposed .
and his credibility is really , really weak . "
but it 's not just a question of overexposure .
as giovanni valentini said , promotion only works if the product is good .
" but when the product is old , is not good , is bad , television is not enough . "
and now that italians are feeling the pinch in their pocketbooks , it seems they may be ready to change the channel . megan williams , rome -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi forms new government italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a new government saturday , leaving key ministries untouched while bringing in his longtime ally and former economy minister giulio tremonti as deputy premier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.05.2005 bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 players celebrate qualifying for the champions league there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .
there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .

there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things .

and it seems this time , tv is n't keeping him afloat . silvio berlusconi may nave immense political and media power , but it has n't been enough for italy 's billionaire prime minister .
when journalists bring to light unpleasant facts such as his association with the mafia , charges against him for bribing judges , and his tailor-made laws to get him and friends off the legal hook , he has n't liked it . in its april 28 , 2003 issue , the economist 's cover page read " why berlusconi is unfit to lead italy . "
journalist david lane wrote the article that chronicled many of berlusconi 's shady dealings .
the italian prime minister sued .
four years later , lane 's still involved in the lawsuit against the magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist struck again with their aug .
1 , 2003 title : " dear mr. berlusconi : a challenge to italy 's prime minister " lane , the author numerous damning articles on berlusconi , said italy 's leader does n't only lack understanding of the role of a critical press in a healthy democracy .
he also has been a disaster on the economic front .
even worse , lane said , berlusconi has wasted precious energy as a leader claiming he 's the victim of a political witch hunt . " he 's always maintained that the foreign press is in league with the centre-left opposition , " lane said .
" and despite the fact that the economist is a notoriously right-wing magazine , he seems to believe that we , in common with other newspapers and magazines from outside italy , are out to get him . "
" never , never , never … " in his first appearance as prime minister on public network , rai , which he now controls , he said the plot against him does n't stop with left wingers and the foreign press .
it includes , well , almost everyone .
" i 've always contended that there 's the official state and then a parallel state made up of powerful segments of society that are in the hands of the left , " berlusconi said .
" they include high schools , universities , newspapers , radios , television , judges , the constitutional court , and i 'll stop here simply to be charitable to my homeland .
some italians understand this , but the rest need to see this , too . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai logo berlusconi went even further , saying that with the exception of one newscaster , emilio fede , a notorious berlusconi cheerleader , his tv channels are unpartisan , and " there have never been attacks on my political rivals . " " it 's an amazing lie because berlusconi last year had important italian journalists , such as michele santoro , enzo biagi , fired from public television , " explained tommaso dibenedetti .
the columnist said berlusconi 's favorite method of silencing critics is by firing them .
but he 's also turned to the courts to put a chill on political debate . giovanni valentini , a journalist at rome 's la repubblica daily , is one of the many berlusconi is suing .
in the article in question , valentini identified the prime minister 's conflict of interest in pocketing $ 3 million -lrb- 3.8 million euros -rrb- from tv ads a year .
" do n't forget that he 's the strongest political man in europe , one thousand times richer than the american president , " valentini stressed .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.05.2005 fear and confusion on the campaign trail back to first page back 2/2 at the last state elections in 2000 , more than 40 percent of the electorate didn ’ t vote , which was an increase of 26 percent on 30 years ago .
the number of non-voters in the state has become so significant that it could have an impact on the final election result in north rhine-westphalia .
opinion polls have shown the cdu to be ahead of the spd for weeks .
but the spd is slowly catching up again .
so , it could be a neck-to-neck race - in which case , every vote will count .
and the parties are fighting for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election campaign has given rise to the first political tv-duel in the history of state elections in germany .
state premier peer steinbrück , of the spd , and his cdu rival jürgen rüttgers , have been invited to go head-to-head live on tv - more than once . at times , the debate has been lively , and sometimes heated .
but the main topics remain : the state budget , unemployment figures , education , and , of course , energy issues and the future of coal mining . media circus causes mixed feelings in electorate for the people of north rhine-westphalia , such media events are a mixed affair .
" it is interesting to see both candidates confronting each other and answering the questions .
i think that ’ s a good thing , " says one lady .
" and i think that people who are not so familiar with politics can get to know the candidates better , and can then come to a decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i believe that if people are really interested in politics , they don ’ t need tv debates .
but since – unfortunately - this is a modern election campaign , it ’ s a typical thing to do , " a male viewer comments .
" but i ’ m sceptical .
if you want to get good information , you have to read the party manifestos .
that ’ s much better . " but not many voters read party manifestos .
and according to political analysts , tv-duels , and similar media events , could have an impact on the outcome of the election .
this explains why the cdu has been accused of using another recent media event , at national level to target votes .
it was a parliamentary inquiry into germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer , and his ministry , which was broadcast live on tv . cdu accused of employing opportunistic tactics the inquiry which was headed by the cdu claimed that the federal government ’ s visa policy was too liberal and had caused an influx of criminals into germany .
but just how influential the inquiry will be is unclear .
richard hilmer , managing director of the think tank infratest-dimap has dismissed concerns : " the topic won ’ t harm the reputation of the red-green government .
in fact , i don ’ t think the spd or the greens will face a setback . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering regardless of that , the spd ’ s party chief , franz müntefering , has launched a counter attack .
he ’ s criticised international businesses and their bosses , describing their practises as asocial and unfair .
he even compared foreign investors to a swarm of locusts .
and it ’ s sparked a massive public reaction – dubbed ‘ the capitalism debate ’ . ' locust ' outburst respected but suspicions remain " it ’ s true , in fact , that a large majority of the population supports his criticism , " hilmer adds , " even traditional cdu / csu and fdp supporters .
but people are suspicious of his timing : five weeks before the election , at a time , when the spd isn ’ t doing too well .
a large majority sees the debate as political tactics before the election . " but the state election in north rhine-westphalia continues to draw unprecedented attention from federal politicians because this is the last state governed by the spd-green party coalition .
if it loses its majority here , it will send aftershocks to berlin and seriously damage the national red-green coalition of chancellor gerhard schröder .
a feeling shared on the streets : " i think the election in north rhine-westphalia will have a great impact on the federal parliamentary elections in 2006 , " says one woman .
" if there ’ s a change of power here , i think that would give a new momentum to the federal elections . " a mood for change may be misread so , people across germany will be watching closely .
but as richard hilmer reminds , the election is not over until the last vote is cast : " there is definitely a mood for change .
but i would be careful to say that the election is already over .
because in the polls ahead of the elections in the state of schleswig-holstein , in february , we saw that the ruling party was way ahead until one week before the election .
but in the end it was defeated . " in that election , the spd ’ s heidi simonis , lost her seat - and then her job .
that is a series of events that spd politicians in north-rhine westphalia will be eager to avoid . svenja üing -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hits trail to save key election german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was to make a last-ditch effort to help his social democratic party hold onto power in the key state of north rhine-westphalia in elections sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.05.2005 fear and confusion on the campaign trail back to first page back 2/2 at the last state elections in 2000 , more than 40 percent of the electorate didn ’ t vote , which was an increase of 26 percent on 30 years ago .
the number of non-voters in the state has become so significant that it could have an impact on the final election result in north rhine-westphalia .
opinion polls have shown the cdu to be ahead of the spd for weeks .
but the spd is slowly catching up again .
so , it could be a neck-to-neck race - in which case , every vote will count .
and the parties are fighting for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election campaign has given rise to the first political tv-duel in the history of state elections in germany .
state premier peer steinbrück , of the spd , and his cdu rival jürgen rüttgers , have been invited to go head-to-head live on tv - more than once . at times , the debate has been lively , and sometimes heated .
but the main topics remain : the state budget , unemployment figures , education , and , of course , energy issues and the future of coal mining . media circus causes mixed feelings in electorate for the people of north rhine-westphalia , such media events are a mixed affair .
" it is interesting to see both candidates confronting each other and answering the questions .
i think that ’ s a good thing , " says one lady .
" and i think that people who are not so familiar with politics can get to know the candidates better , and can then come to a decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i believe that if people are really interested in politics , they don ’ t need tv debates .
but since – unfortunately - this is a modern election campaign , it ’ s a typical thing to do , " a male viewer comments .
" but i ’ m sceptical .
if you want to get good information , you have to read the party manifestos .
that ’ s much better . " but not many voters read party manifestos .
and according to political analysts , tv-duels , and similar media events , could have an impact on the outcome of the election .
this explains why the cdu has been accused of using another recent media event , at national level to target votes .
it was a parliamentary inquiry into germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer , and his ministry , which was broadcast live on tv . cdu accused of employing opportunistic tactics the inquiry which was headed by the cdu claimed that the federal government ’ s visa policy was too liberal and had caused an influx of criminals into germany .
but just how influential the inquiry will be is unclear .
richard hilmer , managing director of the think tank infratest-dimap has dismissed concerns : " the topic won ’ t harm the reputation of the red-green government .
in fact , i don ’ t think the spd or the greens will face a setback . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering regardless of that , the spd ’ s party chief , franz müntefering , has launched a counter attack .
he ’ s criticised international businesses and their bosses , describing their practises as asocial and unfair .
he even compared foreign investors to a swarm of locusts .
and it ’ s sparked a massive public reaction – dubbed ‘ the capitalism debate ’ . ' locust ' outburst respected but suspicions remain " it ’ s true , in fact , that a large majority of the population supports his criticism , " hilmer adds , " even traditional cdu / csu and fdp supporters .
but people are suspicious of his timing : five weeks before the election , at a time , when the spd isn ’ t doing too well .
a large majority sees the debate as political tactics before the election . " but the state election in north rhine-westphalia continues to draw unprecedented attention from federal politicians because this is the last state governed by the spd-green party coalition .
if it loses its majority here , it will send aftershocks to berlin and seriously damage the national red-green coalition of chancellor gerhard schröder .
a feeling shared on the streets : " i think the election in north rhine-westphalia will have a great impact on the federal parliamentary elections in 2006 , " says one woman .
" if there ’ s a change of power here , i think that would give a new momentum to the federal elections . " a mood for change may be misread so , people across germany will be watching closely .
but as richard hilmer reminds , the election is not over until the last vote is cast : " there is definitely a mood for change .
but i would be careful to say that the election is already over .
because in the polls ahead of the elections in the state of schleswig-holstein , in february , we saw that the ruling party was way ahead until one week before the election .
but in the end it was defeated . " in that election , the spd ’ s heidi simonis , lost her seat - and then her job .
that is a series of events that spd politicians in north-rhine westphalia will be eager to avoid . svenja üing -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hits trail to save key election german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was to make a last-ditch effort to help his social democratic party hold onto power in the key state of north rhine-westphalia in elections sunday .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers to the strains of europe 's 80 's rock standard ' the final countdown ' , the cdu ’ s jürgen rüttgers enters and people rise from their chairs , applauding , while the sound system pumps the soft rock anthem throughout the hall .
it ’ s a bit like the emotionally charged party meetings in the united states .
and just like other political parties would , at such an event , the cdu is self-congratulatory . rüttgers ’ speech is what you ’ d expect of the candidate : strong criticism of the spd ’ s performance in the state of north rhine-westphalia , in the four decades since the cdu was last into power . significant numbers are unhappy with the spd a significant number of the 18 million people in north rhine-westphalia are unhappy .
unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .
but the state is also burdened with a large budget deficit .
schools and universities have no money .
and many shops , hospitals and factories have had to close down .
the people on the streets are frustrated . " i ’ ve got the feeling that there ’ s no progress at all in north rhine-westphalia , and that everything is getting worse , " says one disgruntled resident . things used to be different .
the geographical heart of north rhine-westphalia , the densely-populated ruhrgebiet , was once the industrial centre of germany .
the coal and steel industry characterised the region and its economy and landscape for decades , and it shaped the people living here . most of them were strong supporters of the spd .
it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .
but over the years , the majority of jobs in the coal and steel industry here have been cut .
now , only 40,000 miners are left - of what used to be more than 500,000 .
it ’ s a process of social transition that could make itself felt at the north rhine-westphalia elections . splinter groups formed by disillusioned socialists bildunterschrift : there are currently four parties in north rhine westphalia ’ s state parliament : the spd and the greens form the ruling coalition .
and in the opposition there ’ s the cdu and fdp – the free democratic party .
but many spd members are dissatisfied with their own party .
and recently , a splinter group - together with lobbyists and members of non-governmental organisations - formed a new party : the wasg .
but they ’ ve yet to make an impact . wasg stands for wahlalternative arbeit und soziale gerechtigkeit , a loose translation of which would be the alternative party for work and social equality .
but many people in north-rhine westphalia have no idea what the wasg is .
according to opinion polls , the wasg is unlikely to get more than 2 percent of the vote .
but wasg party members are optimistic , says top candidate jürgen klute : " we ’ ve found candidates for all of the 128 constituencies .
and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .
" we ’ re aiming to be a left-wing alternative for these people - before they go and vote for a right-wing party .
and we also hope that we will be able motivate some of them to vote at all .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers to the strains of europe 's 80 's rock standard ' the final countdown ' , the cdu ’ s jürgen rüttgers enters and people rise from their chairs , applauding , while the sound system pumps the soft rock anthem throughout the hall .
it ’ s a bit like the emotionally charged party meetings in the united states .
and just like other political parties would , at such an event , the cdu is self-congratulatory . rüttgers ’ speech is what you ’ d expect of the candidate : strong criticism of the spd ’ s performance in the state of north rhine-westphalia , in the four decades since the cdu was last into power . significant numbers are unhappy with the spd a significant number of the 18 million people in north rhine-westphalia are unhappy .
unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .
but the state is also burdened with a large budget deficit .
schools and universities have no money .
and many shops , hospitals and factories have had to close down .
the people on the streets are frustrated . " i ’ ve got the feeling that there ’ s no progress at all in north rhine-westphalia , and that everything is getting worse , " says one disgruntled resident . things used to be different .
the geographical heart of north rhine-westphalia , the densely-populated ruhrgebiet , was once the industrial centre of germany .
the coal and steel industry characterised the region and its economy and landscape for decades , and it shaped the people living here . most of them were strong supporters of the spd .
it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .
but over the years , the majority of jobs in the coal and steel industry here have been cut .
now , only 40,000 miners are left - of what used to be more than 500,000 .
it ’ s a process of social transition that could make itself felt at the north rhine-westphalia elections . splinter groups formed by disillusioned socialists bildunterschrift : there are currently four parties in north rhine westphalia ’ s state parliament : the spd and the greens form the ruling coalition .
and in the opposition there ’ s the cdu and fdp – the free democratic party .
but many spd members are dissatisfied with their own party .
and recently , a splinter group - together with lobbyists and members of non-governmental organisations - formed a new party : the wasg .
but they ’ ve yet to make an impact . wasg stands for wahlalternative arbeit und soziale gerechtigkeit , a loose translation of which would be the alternative party for work and social equality .
but many people in north-rhine westphalia have no idea what the wasg is .
according to opinion polls , the wasg is unlikely to get more than 2 percent of the vote .
but wasg party members are optimistic , says top candidate jürgen klute : " we ’ ve found candidates for all of the 128 constituencies .
and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .
" we ’ re aiming to be a left-wing alternative for these people - before they go and vote for a right-wing party .
and we also hope that we will be able motivate some of them to vote at all .

there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .
schalke grab last gasp goal to qualify schalke 04 ended their rollercoaster season on a high with a 3-2 victory at sc freiburg on saturday to clinch second place and an automatic spot in next season 's champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after investing heavily in players schalke management demanded a spot in the money-spinning champions league and ralf rangnick 's side delivered with a tense win over freiburg .
ebbe sand scored in the sixth minute to put schalke on the right track but alexander iaschvili equalized five minutes later after a kind deflection off the post .
brazilian marcelo bordon then put schalke back in front on 55 minutes and netted again in the 89th minute after relegated freiburg had equalized for the second time .
schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .
" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .
hertha rue misses , join leverkusen in uefa cup hertha could have secured third place with a home win over hanover but were left ruing a string of missed chances in a 0-0 draw .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .

the number of non-voters in the state has become so significant that it could have an impact on the final election result in north rhine-westphalia .
opinion polls have shown the cdu to be ahead of the spd for weeks .
but the spd is slowly catching up again .
so , it could be a neck-to-neck race - in which case , every vote will count .
and the parties are fighting for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election campaign has given rise to the first political tv-duel in the history of state elections in germany .
state premier peer steinbrück , of the spd , and his cdu rival jürgen rüttgers , have been invited to go head-to-head live on tv - more than once . at times , the debate has been lively , and sometimes heated .
but the main topics remain : the state budget , unemployment figures , education , and , of course , energy issues and the future of coal mining . media circus causes mixed feelings in electorate for the people of north rhine-westphalia , such media events are a mixed affair .
" it is interesting to see both candidates confronting each other and answering the questions .
i think that ’ s a good thing , " says one lady .
" and i think that people who are not so familiar with politics can get to know the candidates better , and can then come to a decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i believe that if people are really interested in politics , they don ’ t need tv debates .
but since – unfortunately - this is a modern election campaign , it ’ s a typical thing to do , " a male viewer comments .
" but i ’ m sceptical .
if you want to get good information , you have to read the party manifestos .
that ’ s much better . " but not many voters read party manifestos .
and according to political analysts , tv-duels , and similar media events , could have an impact on the outcome of the election .
this explains why the cdu has been accused of using another recent media event , at national level to target votes .
it was a parliamentary inquiry into germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer , and his ministry , which was broadcast live on tv . cdu accused of employing opportunistic tactics the inquiry which was headed by the cdu claimed that the federal government ’ s visa policy was too liberal and had caused an influx of criminals into germany .
but just how influential the inquiry will be is unclear .
richard hilmer , managing director of the think tank infratest-dimap has dismissed concerns : " the topic won ’ t harm the reputation of the red-green government .
in fact , i don ’ t think the spd or the greens will face a setback . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering regardless of that , the spd ’ s party chief , franz müntefering , has launched a counter attack .
he ’ s criticised international businesses and their bosses , describing their practises as asocial and unfair .
he even compared foreign investors to a swarm of locusts .
and it ’ s sparked a massive public reaction – dubbed ‘ the capitalism debate ’ . ' locust ' outburst respected but suspicions remain " it ’ s true , in fact , that a large majority of the population supports his criticism , " hilmer adds , " even traditional cdu / csu and fdp supporters .
but people are suspicious of his timing : five weeks before the election , at a time , when the spd isn ’ t doing too well .
a large majority sees the debate as political tactics before the election . " but the state election in north rhine-westphalia continues to draw unprecedented attention from federal politicians because this is the last state governed by the spd-green party coalition .
if it loses its majority here , it will send aftershocks to berlin and seriously damage the national red-green coalition of chancellor gerhard schröder .
a feeling shared on the streets : " i think the election in north rhine-westphalia will have a great impact on the federal parliamentary elections in 2006 , " says one woman .
" if there ’ s a change of power here , i think that would give a new momentum to the federal elections . " a mood for change may be misread so , people across germany will be watching closely .
but as richard hilmer reminds , the election is not over until the last vote is cast : " there is definitely a mood for change .
but i would be careful to say that the election is already over .
because in the polls ahead of the elections in the state of schleswig-holstein , in february , we saw that the ruling party was way ahead until one week before the election .
but in the end it was defeated . " in that election , the spd ’ s heidi simonis , lost her seat - and then her job .
that is a series of events that spd politicians in north-rhine westphalia will be eager to avoid . svenja üing -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hits trail to save key election german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was to make a last-ditch effort to help his social democratic party hold onto power in the key state of north rhine-westphalia in elections sunday .

" and i think that people who are not so familiar with politics can get to know the candidates better , and can then come to a decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i believe that if people are really interested in politics , they don ’ t need tv debates .
but since – unfortunately - this is a modern election campaign , it ’ s a typical thing to do , " a male viewer comments .
" but i ’ m sceptical .
if you want to get good information , you have to read the party manifestos .
that ’ s much better . " but not many voters read party manifestos .
and according to political analysts , tv-duels , and similar media events , could have an impact on the outcome of the election .
this explains why the cdu has been accused of using another recent media event , at national level to target votes .
it was a parliamentary inquiry into germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer , and his ministry , which was broadcast live on tv . cdu accused of employing opportunistic tactics the inquiry which was headed by the cdu claimed that the federal government ’ s visa policy was too liberal and had caused an influx of criminals into germany .
but just how influential the inquiry will be is unclear .
richard hilmer , managing director of the think tank infratest-dimap has dismissed concerns : " the topic won ’ t harm the reputation of the red-green government .
in fact , i don ’ t think the spd or the greens will face a setback . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering regardless of that , the spd ’ s party chief , franz müntefering , has launched a counter attack .
he ’ s criticised international businesses and their bosses , describing their practises as asocial and unfair .
he even compared foreign investors to a swarm of locusts .
and it ’ s sparked a massive public reaction – dubbed ‘ the capitalism debate ’ . ' locust ' outburst respected but suspicions remain " it ’ s true , in fact , that a large majority of the population supports his criticism , " hilmer adds , " even traditional cdu / csu and fdp supporters .
but people are suspicious of his timing : five weeks before the election , at a time , when the spd isn ’ t doing too well .
a large majority sees the debate as political tactics before the election . " but the state election in north rhine-westphalia continues to draw unprecedented attention from federal politicians because this is the last state governed by the spd-green party coalition .
if it loses its majority here , it will send aftershocks to berlin and seriously damage the national red-green coalition of chancellor gerhard schröder .
a feeling shared on the streets : " i think the election in north rhine-westphalia will have a great impact on the federal parliamentary elections in 2006 , " says one woman .
" if there ’ s a change of power here , i think that would give a new momentum to the federal elections . " a mood for change may be misread so , people across germany will be watching closely .
but as richard hilmer reminds , the election is not over until the last vote is cast : " there is definitely a mood for change .
but i would be careful to say that the election is already over .
because in the polls ahead of the elections in the state of schleswig-holstein , in february , we saw that the ruling party was way ahead until one week before the election .
but in the end it was defeated . " in that election , the spd ’ s heidi simonis , lost her seat - and then her job .
that is a series of events that spd politicians in north-rhine westphalia will be eager to avoid . svenja üing -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hits trail to save key election german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was to make a last-ditch effort to help his social democratic party hold onto power in the key state of north rhine-westphalia in elections sunday .

back to first page back 2/2 got the power la repubblica is one of the few dailies that has dared to speak out against berlusconi .
one of the reasons it 's so outspoken is its owner , carlo dibenedetti , who once tried to buy italy 's second-largest publishing house , mondadore .
instead , berlusconi took control of it by bribing judges , david lane said .
but newspapers do n't have a great deal of influence on the italian public .
la repubblica and l 'unita , the two main papers openly critical of italy 's leader , have a combined circulation of less than 800,000 .
the real power lies in television .
berlusconi 's three privately owned channels are renowned for combining fluffy entertainment with fawning political talk shows .
this lightweight , fun and games combo has been key to swaying a lot of voters , said giovanni valentini .
" and we know that about 6 percent of the voters vote under the influence of television .
this 6 percent is about 3 million people , " valentini said .
" in the last political elections , we had about 600,000 votes between center-left and center-right .
this is the problem . "
voters not convinced but it may not be as big as critics have feared .
in april regional elections across the country voters voiced their widespread dissatisfaction with berlusconi and his government .
candidates from opposition parties swept into power in 11 out of 13 regions .
with national elections a year away , voters have shown they 're no longer so amenable to berlusconi 's self-serving laws and poor handling of the economy .
nor do they buy his recent explanation for the bad economic outlook - that italians do n't work hard enough and vacation to much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do italians spend to much time on holiday ?
even tv appearances are n't helping this time , according to tommaso dibenedetti .
" berlusconi is now over-exposed .
and his credibility is really , really weak . "
but it 's not just a question of overexposure .
as giovanni valentini said , promotion only works if the product is good .
" but when the product is old , is not good , is bad , television is not enough . "

and it seems this time , tv is n't keeping him afloat . silvio berlusconi may nave immense political and media power , but it has n't been enough for italy 's billionaire prime minister .
when journalists bring to light unpleasant facts such as his association with the mafia , charges against him for bribing judges , and his tailor-made laws to get him and friends off the legal hook , he has n't liked it . in its april 28 , 2003 issue , the economist 's cover page read " why berlusconi is unfit to lead italy . "
journalist david lane wrote the article that chronicled many of berlusconi 's shady dealings .
the italian prime minister sued .
four years later , lane 's still involved in the lawsuit against the magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist struck again with their aug .
1 , 2003 title : " dear mr. berlusconi : a challenge to italy 's prime minister " lane , the author numerous damning articles on berlusconi , said italy 's leader does n't only lack understanding of the role of a critical press in a healthy democracy .
he also has been a disaster on the economic front .
even worse , lane said , berlusconi has wasted precious energy as a leader claiming he 's the victim of a political witch hunt . " he 's always maintained that the foreign press is in league with the centre-left opposition , " lane said .
" and despite the fact that the economist is a notoriously right-wing magazine , he seems to believe that we , in common with other newspapers and magazines from outside italy , are out to get him . "
" never , never , never … " in his first appearance as prime minister on public network , rai , which he now controls , he said the plot against him does n't stop with left wingers and the foreign press .
it includes , well , almost everyone .
" i 've always contended that there 's the official state and then a parallel state made up of powerful segments of society that are in the hands of the left , " berlusconi said .
" they include high schools , universities , newspapers , radios , television , judges , the constitutional court , and i 'll stop here simply to be charitable to my homeland .
some italians understand this , but the rest need to see this , too . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai logo berlusconi went even further , saying that with the exception of one newscaster , emilio fede , a notorious berlusconi cheerleader , his tv channels are unpartisan , and " there have never been attacks on my political rivals . " " it 's an amazing lie because berlusconi last year had important italian journalists , such as michele santoro , enzo biagi , fired from public television , " explained tommaso dibenedetti .
the columnist said berlusconi 's favorite method of silencing critics is by firing them .
but he 's also turned to the courts to put a chill on political debate . giovanni valentini , a journalist at rome 's la repubblica daily , is one of the many berlusconi is suing .
in the article in question , valentini identified the prime minister 's conflict of interest in pocketing $ 3 million -lrb- 3.8 million euros -rrb- from tv ads a year .
" do n't forget that he 's the strongest political man in europe , one thousand times richer than the american president , " valentini stressed .

dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .

" if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers to the strains of europe 's 80 's rock standard ' the final countdown ' , the cdu ’ s jürgen rüttgers enters and people rise from their chairs , applauding , while the sound system pumps the soft rock anthem throughout the hall .
it ’ s a bit like the emotionally charged party meetings in the united states .
and just like other political parties would , at such an event , the cdu is self-congratulatory . rüttgers ’ speech is what you ’ d expect of the candidate : strong criticism of the spd ’ s performance in the state of north rhine-westphalia , in the four decades since the cdu was last into power . significant numbers are unhappy with the spd a significant number of the 18 million people in north rhine-westphalia are unhappy .
unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .
but the state is also burdened with a large budget deficit .
schools and universities have no money .
and many shops , hospitals and factories have had to close down .
the people on the streets are frustrated . " i ’ ve got the feeling that there ’ s no progress at all in north rhine-westphalia , and that everything is getting worse , " says one disgruntled resident . things used to be different .
the geographical heart of north rhine-westphalia , the densely-populated ruhrgebiet , was once the industrial centre of germany .
the coal and steel industry characterised the region and its economy and landscape for decades , and it shaped the people living here . most of them were strong supporters of the spd .
it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .
but over the years , the majority of jobs in the coal and steel industry here have been cut .
now , only 40,000 miners are left - of what used to be more than 500,000 .
it ’ s a process of social transition that could make itself felt at the north rhine-westphalia elections . splinter groups formed by disillusioned socialists bildunterschrift : there are currently four parties in north rhine westphalia ’ s state parliament : the spd and the greens form the ruling coalition .
and in the opposition there ’ s the cdu and fdp – the free democratic party .
but many spd members are dissatisfied with their own party .
and recently , a splinter group - together with lobbyists and members of non-governmental organisations - formed a new party : the wasg .
but they ’ ve yet to make an impact . wasg stands for wahlalternative arbeit und soziale gerechtigkeit , a loose translation of which would be the alternative party for work and social equality .
but many people in north-rhine westphalia have no idea what the wasg is .
according to opinion polls , the wasg is unlikely to get more than 2 percent of the vote .
but wasg party members are optimistic , says top candidate jürgen klute : " we ’ ve found candidates for all of the 128 constituencies .
and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .
" we ’ re aiming to be a left-wing alternative for these people - before they go and vote for a right-wing party .
and we also hope that we will be able motivate some of them to vote at all .

and it seems this time , tv is n't keeping him afloat . silvio berlusconi may nave immense political and media power , but it has n't been enough for italy 's billionaire prime minister .
when journalists bring to light unpleasant facts such as his association with the mafia , charges against him for bribing judges , and his tailor-made laws to get him and friends off the legal hook , he has n't liked it . in its april 28 , 2003 issue , the economist 's cover page read " why berlusconi is unfit to lead italy . "
journalist david lane wrote the article that chronicled many of berlusconi 's shady dealings .
the italian prime minister sued .
four years later , lane 's still involved in the lawsuit against the magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist struck again with their aug .
1 , 2003 title : " dear mr. berlusconi : a challenge to italy 's prime minister " lane , the author numerous damning articles on berlusconi , said italy 's leader does n't only lack understanding of the role of a critical press in a healthy democracy .
he also has been a disaster on the economic front .
even worse , lane said , berlusconi has wasted precious energy as a leader claiming he 's the victim of a political witch hunt . " he 's always maintained that the foreign press is in league with the centre-left opposition , " lane said .
" and despite the fact that the economist is a notoriously right-wing magazine , he seems to believe that we , in common with other newspapers and magazines from outside italy , are out to get him . "
" never , never , never … " in his first appearance as prime minister on public network , rai , which he now controls , he said the plot against him does n't stop with left wingers and the foreign press .
it includes , well , almost everyone .
" i 've always contended that there 's the official state and then a parallel state made up of powerful segments of society that are in the hands of the left , " berlusconi said .
" they include high schools , universities , newspapers , radios , television , judges , the constitutional court , and i 'll stop here simply to be charitable to my homeland .
some italians understand this , but the rest need to see this , too . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai logo berlusconi went even further , saying that with the exception of one newscaster , emilio fede , a notorious berlusconi cheerleader , his tv channels are unpartisan , and " there have never been attacks on my political rivals . " " it 's an amazing lie because berlusconi last year had important italian journalists , such as michele santoro , enzo biagi , fired from public television , " explained tommaso dibenedetti .
the columnist said berlusconi 's favorite method of silencing critics is by firing them .
but he 's also turned to the courts to put a chill on political debate . giovanni valentini , a journalist at rome 's la repubblica daily , is one of the many berlusconi is suing .
in the article in question , valentini identified the prime minister 's conflict of interest in pocketing $ 3 million -lrb- 3.8 million euros -rrb- from tv ads a year .
" do n't forget that he 's the strongest political man in europe , one thousand times richer than the american president , " valentini stressed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.05.2005 bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 players celebrate qualifying for the champions league there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .
there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .
schalke grab last gasp goal to qualify schalke 04 ended their rollercoaster season on a high with a 3-2 victory at sc freiburg on saturday to clinch second place and an automatic spot in next season 's champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after investing heavily in players schalke management demanded a spot in the money-spinning champions league and ralf rangnick 's side delivered with a tense win over freiburg .
ebbe sand scored in the sixth minute to put schalke on the right track but alexander iaschvili equalized five minutes later after a kind deflection off the post .
brazilian marcelo bordon then put schalke back in front on 55 minutes and netted again in the 89th minute after relegated freiburg had equalized for the second time .
schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .
" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .
hertha rue misses , join leverkusen in uefa cup hertha could have secured third place with a home win over hanover but were left ruing a string of missed chances in a 0-0 draw .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .

and it seems this time , tv is n't keeping him afloat . silvio berlusconi may nave immense political and media power , but it has n't been enough for italy 's billionaire prime minister .
when journalists bring to light unpleasant facts such as his association with the mafia , charges against him for bribing judges , and his tailor-made laws to get him and friends off the legal hook , he has n't liked it . in its april 28 , 2003 issue , the economist 's cover page read " why berlusconi is unfit to lead italy . "
journalist david lane wrote the article that chronicled many of berlusconi 's shady dealings .
the italian prime minister sued .
four years later , lane 's still involved in the lawsuit against the magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economist struck again with their aug .
1 , 2003 title : " dear mr. berlusconi : a challenge to italy 's prime minister " lane , the author numerous damning articles on berlusconi , said italy 's leader does n't only lack understanding of the role of a critical press in a healthy democracy .
he also has been a disaster on the economic front .
even worse , lane said , berlusconi has wasted precious energy as a leader claiming he 's the victim of a political witch hunt . " he 's always maintained that the foreign press is in league with the centre-left opposition , " lane said .
" and despite the fact that the economist is a notoriously right-wing magazine , he seems to believe that we , in common with other newspapers and magazines from outside italy , are out to get him . "
" never , never , never … " in his first appearance as prime minister on public network , rai , which he now controls , he said the plot against him does n't stop with left wingers and the foreign press .
it includes , well , almost everyone .
" i 've always contended that there 's the official state and then a parallel state made up of powerful segments of society that are in the hands of the left , " berlusconi said .
" they include high schools , universities , newspapers , radios , television , judges , the constitutional court , and i 'll stop here simply to be charitable to my homeland .
some italians understand this , but the rest need to see this , too . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai logo berlusconi went even further , saying that with the exception of one newscaster , emilio fede , a notorious berlusconi cheerleader , his tv channels are unpartisan , and " there have never been attacks on my political rivals . " " it 's an amazing lie because berlusconi last year had important italian journalists , such as michele santoro , enzo biagi , fired from public television , " explained tommaso dibenedetti .
the columnist said berlusconi 's favorite method of silencing critics is by firing them .
but he 's also turned to the courts to put a chill on political debate . giovanni valentini , a journalist at rome 's la repubblica daily , is one of the many berlusconi is suing .
in the article in question , valentini identified the prime minister 's conflict of interest in pocketing $ 3 million -lrb- 3.8 million euros -rrb- from tv ads a year .
" do n't forget that he 's the strongest political man in europe , one thousand times richer than the american president , " valentini stressed .

1 , 2003 title : " dear mr. berlusconi : a challenge to italy 's prime minister " lane , the author numerous damning articles on berlusconi , said italy 's leader does n't only lack understanding of the role of a critical press in a healthy democracy .
he also has been a disaster on the economic front .
even worse , lane said , berlusconi has wasted precious energy as a leader claiming he 's the victim of a political witch hunt . " he 's always maintained that the foreign press is in league with the centre-left opposition , " lane said .
" and despite the fact that the economist is a notoriously right-wing magazine , he seems to believe that we , in common with other newspapers and magazines from outside italy , are out to get him . "

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers to the strains of europe 's 80 's rock standard ' the final countdown ' , the cdu ’ s jürgen rüttgers enters and people rise from their chairs , applauding , while the sound system pumps the soft rock anthem throughout the hall .
it ’ s a bit like the emotionally charged party meetings in the united states .
and just like other political parties would , at such an event , the cdu is self-congratulatory . rüttgers ’ speech is what you ’ d expect of the candidate : strong criticism of the spd ’ s performance in the state of north rhine-westphalia , in the four decades since the cdu was last into power . significant numbers are unhappy with the spd a significant number of the 18 million people in north rhine-westphalia are unhappy .
unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .
but the state is also burdened with a large budget deficit .
schools and universities have no money .
and many shops , hospitals and factories have had to close down .
the people on the streets are frustrated . " i ’ ve got the feeling that there ’ s no progress at all in north rhine-westphalia , and that everything is getting worse , " says one disgruntled resident . things used to be different .
the geographical heart of north rhine-westphalia , the densely-populated ruhrgebiet , was once the industrial centre of germany .
the coal and steel industry characterised the region and its economy and landscape for decades , and it shaped the people living here . most of them were strong supporters of the spd .
it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .

he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers to the strains of europe 's 80 's rock standard ' the final countdown ' , the cdu ’ s jürgen rüttgers enters and people rise from their chairs , applauding , while the sound system pumps the soft rock anthem throughout the hall .
it ’ s a bit like the emotionally charged party meetings in the united states .
and just like other political parties would , at such an event , the cdu is self-congratulatory . rüttgers ’ speech is what you ’ d expect of the candidate : strong criticism of the spd ’ s performance in the state of north rhine-westphalia , in the four decades since the cdu was last into power . significant numbers are unhappy with the spd a significant number of the 18 million people in north rhine-westphalia are unhappy .
unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .
but the state is also burdened with a large budget deficit .
schools and universities have no money .
and many shops , hospitals and factories have had to close down .
the people on the streets are frustrated . " i ’ ve got the feeling that there ’ s no progress at all in north rhine-westphalia , and that everything is getting worse , " says one disgruntled resident . things used to be different .
the geographical heart of north rhine-westphalia , the densely-populated ruhrgebiet , was once the industrial centre of germany .
the coal and steel industry characterised the region and its economy and landscape for decades , and it shaped the people living here . most of them were strong supporters of the spd .
it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .
but over the years , the majority of jobs in the coal and steel industry here have been cut .
now , only 40,000 miners are left - of what used to be more than 500,000 .
it ’ s a process of social transition that could make itself felt at the north rhine-westphalia elections . splinter groups formed by disillusioned socialists bildunterschrift : there are currently four parties in north rhine westphalia ’ s state parliament : the spd and the greens form the ruling coalition .

for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance . supporters of english soccer traveling abroad have long been accustomed to escorts by plainclothes british officers .
soon , they could have the feeling of being a little more at home when they travel to germany for next year 's world cup .
after talks with their german counterparts this week at the british embassy in berlin , british police officials are leaning towards sending uniformed police officers abroad for the first time .
david swift , the deputy chief constable of staffordshire believes recognizable policemen and women will help to defuse potential trouble .
" they would not have powers of arrest but they would be there in a sort of bobby-on-the-beat role , " swift , also the association of chief police officers ' official responsible for soccer disorder told the guardian .
" they would offer a familiar presence and help increase communication with supporters . "
an ounce of prevention police and security officials will take every precaution necessary in preventing violence between british and german fans .
about 3,000 blacklisted english supporters must surrender their passports ahead of world cup games according to information given the times .
overall , up to 80,000 england fans are expected to come to germany for the tournament .

in addition , the british foreign office will spend an additional 500,000 british pounds -lrb- 725,000 euros -rrb- to beef up its consular operation in germany .
with strong security measures in and around the stadiums , many are more concerned about what could happen at public venues , where hundreds of fans can gather to watch the game .
one official told the the times that german hooligans , most of whom wo n't get tickets , could pick fights while drinking in public in front of any one of the thousands of big screen televisions that will be set up in bars across the country .
large scenes of hooligans rioting in berlin would blemish the cup 's image immensely , something german police officials are all too aware of .
" billions of people will be watching the cup .
we have to do everything to make it work , " said gottrick wewer , of the german interior ministry .
foundation betters ties communication between the sides at all levels and at all points of contact could help .
german police and taxi drivers are supposed to learn english .
wewer told the guardian that the success of dealing with potentially violent fans at the euro 2004 in portugal should be a lesson to germany as well .
a low-key , but strong , police presence should lower the possibility of violence between england and germany supporters .

" we want to offer events in a world cup project that bring people together , " said matthias paskowsky , chairman of the foundation .
" our focus is on english fans and we want to make them feel particularly welcome . "
german interior minister otto schily does not want to leave any stone unturned though .
the fun for fans should n't be reduced by excessive security measures he said recently but hooligans can expect a zero tolerance strategy .
on may 25 , schily and the interior ministers of the 16 federal states will meet in stuttgart to hammer out a final plan so that in all 12 world cup cities , hooliganism will not be able to set root . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's english problem as berlin hopes to further boost foreign tourism ahead of the 2006 world cup , an undercover report by dw-world 's sonia phalnikar suggests that lacking language skills in the service sector might be the biggest problem .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .

most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .

she strongly supports her party .

unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .

schools and universities have no money .

it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .
but over the years , the majority of jobs in the coal and steel industry here have been cut .

and in the opposition there ’ s the cdu and fdp – the free democratic party .
but many spd members are dissatisfied with their own party .
and recently , a splinter group - together with lobbyists and members of non-governmental organisations - formed a new party : the wasg .
but they ’ ve yet to make an impact . wasg stands for wahlalternative arbeit und soziale gerechtigkeit , a loose translation of which would be the alternative party for work and social equality .
but many people in north-rhine westphalia have no idea what the wasg is .
according to opinion polls , the wasg is unlikely to get more than 2 percent of the vote .
but wasg party members are optimistic , says top candidate jürgen klute : " we ’ ve found candidates for all of the 128 constituencies .
and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.05.2005 fear and confusion on the campaign trail back to first page back 2/2 at the last state elections in 2000 , more than 40 percent of the electorate didn ’ t vote , which was an increase of 26 percent on 30 years ago .
the number of non-voters in the state has become so significant that it could have an impact on the final election result in north rhine-westphalia .
opinion polls have shown the cdu to be ahead of the spd for weeks .
but the spd is slowly catching up again .
so , it could be a neck-to-neck race - in which case , every vote will count .
and the parties are fighting for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election campaign has given rise to the first political tv-duel in the history of state elections in germany .
state premier peer steinbrück , of the spd , and his cdu rival jürgen rüttgers , have been invited to go head-to-head live on tv - more than once . at times , the debate has been lively , and sometimes heated .
but the main topics remain : the state budget , unemployment figures , education , and , of course , energy issues and the future of coal mining . media circus causes mixed feelings in electorate for the people of north rhine-westphalia , such media events are a mixed affair .
" it is interesting to see both candidates confronting each other and answering the questions .
i think that ’ s a good thing , " says one lady .
" and i think that people who are not so familiar with politics can get to know the candidates better , and can then come to a decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i believe that if people are really interested in politics , they don ’ t need tv debates .
but since – unfortunately - this is a modern election campaign , it ’ s a typical thing to do , " a male viewer comments .
" but i ’ m sceptical .
if you want to get good information , you have to read the party manifestos .
that ’ s much better . " but not many voters read party manifestos .
and according to political analysts , tv-duels , and similar media events , could have an impact on the outcome of the election .
this explains why the cdu has been accused of using another recent media event , at national level to target votes .
it was a parliamentary inquiry into germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer , and his ministry , which was broadcast live on tv . cdu accused of employing opportunistic tactics the inquiry which was headed by the cdu claimed that the federal government ’ s visa policy was too liberal and had caused an influx of criminals into germany .
but just how influential the inquiry will be is unclear .
richard hilmer , managing director of the think tank infratest-dimap has dismissed concerns : " the topic won ’ t harm the reputation of the red-green government .
in fact , i don ’ t think the spd or the greens will face a setback . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering regardless of that , the spd ’ s party chief , franz müntefering , has launched a counter attack .
he ’ s criticised international businesses and their bosses , describing their practises as asocial and unfair .
he even compared foreign investors to a swarm of locusts .
and it ’ s sparked a massive public reaction – dubbed ‘ the capitalism debate ’ . ' locust ' outburst respected but suspicions remain " it ’ s true , in fact , that a large majority of the population supports his criticism , " hilmer adds , " even traditional cdu / csu and fdp supporters .
but people are suspicious of his timing : five weeks before the election , at a time , when the spd isn ’ t doing too well .
a large majority sees the debate as political tactics before the election . " but the state election in north rhine-westphalia continues to draw unprecedented attention from federal politicians because this is the last state governed by the spd-green party coalition .
if it loses its majority here , it will send aftershocks to berlin and seriously damage the national red-green coalition of chancellor gerhard schröder .
a feeling shared on the streets : " i think the election in north rhine-westphalia will have a great impact on the federal parliamentary elections in 2006 , " says one woman .
" if there ’ s a change of power here , i think that would give a new momentum to the federal elections . " a mood for change may be misread so , people across germany will be watching closely .
but as richard hilmer reminds , the election is not over until the last vote is cast : " there is definitely a mood for change .
but i would be careful to say that the election is already over .
because in the polls ahead of the elections in the state of schleswig-holstein , in february , we saw that the ruling party was way ahead until one week before the election .
but in the end it was defeated . " in that election , the spd ’ s heidi simonis , lost her seat - and then her job .
that is a series of events that spd politicians in north-rhine westphalia will be eager to avoid . svenja üing -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hits trail to save key election german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was to make a last-ditch effort to help his social democratic party hold onto power in the key state of north rhine-westphalia in elections sunday .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers to the strains of europe 's 80 's rock standard ' the final countdown ' , the cdu ’ s jürgen rüttgers enters and people rise from their chairs , applauding , while the sound system pumps the soft rock anthem throughout the hall .
it ’ s a bit like the emotionally charged party meetings in the united states .
and just like other political parties would , at such an event , the cdu is self-congratulatory . rüttgers ’ speech is what you ’ d expect of the candidate : strong criticism of the spd ’ s performance in the state of north rhine-westphalia , in the four decades since the cdu was last into power . significant numbers are unhappy with the spd a significant number of the 18 million people in north rhine-westphalia are unhappy .
unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .
but the state is also burdened with a large budget deficit .
schools and universities have no money .
and many shops , hospitals and factories have had to close down .
the people on the streets are frustrated . " i ’ ve got the feeling that there ’ s no progress at all in north rhine-westphalia , and that everything is getting worse , " says one disgruntled resident . things used to be different .
the geographical heart of north rhine-westphalia , the densely-populated ruhrgebiet , was once the industrial centre of germany .
the coal and steel industry characterised the region and its economy and landscape for decades , and it shaped the people living here . most of them were strong supporters of the spd .
it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .
but over the years , the majority of jobs in the coal and steel industry here have been cut .
now , only 40,000 miners are left - of what used to be more than 500,000 .
it ’ s a process of social transition that could make itself felt at the north rhine-westphalia elections . splinter groups formed by disillusioned socialists bildunterschrift : there are currently four parties in north rhine westphalia ’ s state parliament : the spd and the greens form the ruling coalition .
and in the opposition there ’ s the cdu and fdp – the free democratic party .
but many spd members are dissatisfied with their own party .
and recently , a splinter group - together with lobbyists and members of non-governmental organisations - formed a new party : the wasg .
but they ’ ve yet to make an impact . wasg stands for wahlalternative arbeit und soziale gerechtigkeit , a loose translation of which would be the alternative party for work and social equality .
but many people in north-rhine westphalia have no idea what the wasg is .
according to opinion polls , the wasg is unlikely to get more than 2 percent of the vote .
but wasg party members are optimistic , says top candidate jürgen klute : " we ’ ve found candidates for all of the 128 constituencies .
and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .
" we ’ re aiming to be a left-wing alternative for these people - before they go and vote for a right-wing party .
and we also hope that we will be able motivate some of them to vote at all .

if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .

and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .
" we ’ re aiming to be a left-wing alternative for these people - before they go and vote for a right-wing party .

and in the opposition there ’ s the cdu and fdp – the free democratic party .
but many spd members are dissatisfied with their own party .
and recently , a splinter group - together with lobbyists and members of non-governmental organisations - formed a new party : the wasg .
but they ’ ve yet to make an impact . wasg stands for wahlalternative arbeit und soziale gerechtigkeit , a loose translation of which would be the alternative party for work and social equality .
but many people in north-rhine westphalia have no idea what the wasg is .
according to opinion polls , the wasg is unlikely to get more than 2 percent of the vote .
but wasg party members are optimistic , says top candidate jürgen klute : " we ’ ve found candidates for all of the 128 constituencies .
and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .
" we ’ re aiming to be a left-wing alternative for these people - before they go and vote for a right-wing party .
and we also hope that we will be able motivate some of them to vote at all .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers to the strains of europe 's 80 's rock standard ' the final countdown ' , the cdu ’ s jürgen rüttgers enters and people rise from their chairs , applauding , while the sound system pumps the soft rock anthem throughout the hall .
it ’ s a bit like the emotionally charged party meetings in the united states .
and just like other political parties would , at such an event , the cdu is self-congratulatory . rüttgers ’ speech is what you ’ d expect of the candidate : strong criticism of the spd ’ s performance in the state of north rhine-westphalia , in the four decades since the cdu was last into power . significant numbers are unhappy with the spd a significant number of the 18 million people in north rhine-westphalia are unhappy .
unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .
but the state is also burdened with a large budget deficit .
schools and universities have no money .
and many shops , hospitals and factories have had to close down .
the people on the streets are frustrated . " i ’ ve got the feeling that there ’ s no progress at all in north rhine-westphalia , and that everything is getting worse , " says one disgruntled resident . things used to be different .
the geographical heart of north rhine-westphalia , the densely-populated ruhrgebiet , was once the industrial centre of germany .
the coal and steel industry characterised the region and its economy and landscape for decades , and it shaped the people living here . most of them were strong supporters of the spd .
it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .
but over the years , the majority of jobs in the coal and steel industry here have been cut .
now , only 40,000 miners are left - of what used to be more than 500,000 .
it ’ s a process of social transition that could make itself felt at the north rhine-westphalia elections . splinter groups formed by disillusioned socialists bildunterschrift : there are currently four parties in north rhine westphalia ’ s state parliament : the spd and the greens form the ruling coalition .
and in the opposition there ’ s the cdu and fdp – the free democratic party .
but many spd members are dissatisfied with their own party .
and recently , a splinter group - together with lobbyists and members of non-governmental organisations - formed a new party : the wasg .
but they ’ ve yet to make an impact . wasg stands for wahlalternative arbeit und soziale gerechtigkeit , a loose translation of which would be the alternative party for work and social equality .
but many people in north-rhine westphalia have no idea what the wasg is .
according to opinion polls , the wasg is unlikely to get more than 2 percent of the vote .
but wasg party members are optimistic , says top candidate jürgen klute : " we ’ ve found candidates for all of the 128 constituencies .
and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .
" we ’ re aiming to be a left-wing alternative for these people - before they go and vote for a right-wing party .
and we also hope that we will be able motivate some of them to vote at all .

stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .

there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .
schalke grab last gasp goal to qualify schalke 04 ended their rollercoaster season on a high with a 3-2 victory at sc freiburg on saturday to clinch second place and an automatic spot in next season 's champions league .

ebbe sand scored in the sixth minute to put schalke on the right track but alexander iaschvili equalized five minutes later after a kind deflection off the post .
brazilian marcelo bordon then put schalke back in front on 55 minutes and netted again in the 89th minute after relegated freiburg had equalized for the second time .
schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .
" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .

for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance . supporters of english soccer traveling abroad have long been accustomed to escorts by plainclothes british officers .
soon , they could have the feeling of being a little more at home when they travel to germany for next year 's world cup .
after talks with their german counterparts this week at the british embassy in berlin , british police officials are leaning towards sending uniformed police officers abroad for the first time .
david swift , the deputy chief constable of staffordshire believes recognizable policemen and women will help to defuse potential trouble .
" they would not have powers of arrest but they would be there in a sort of bobby-on-the-beat role , " swift , also the association of chief police officers ' official responsible for soccer disorder told the guardian .
" they would offer a familiar presence and help increase communication with supporters . "
an ounce of prevention police and security officials will take every precaution necessary in preventing violence between british and german fans .
about 3,000 blacklisted english supporters must surrender their passports ahead of world cup games according to information given the times .

with strong security measures in and around the stadiums , many are more concerned about what could happen at public venues , where hundreds of fans can gather to watch the game .
one official told the the times that german hooligans , most of whom wo n't get tickets , could pick fights while drinking in public in front of any one of the thousands of big screen televisions that will be set up in bars across the country .
large scenes of hooligans rioting in berlin would blemish the cup 's image immensely , something german police officials are all too aware of .
" billions of people will be watching the cup .
we have to do everything to make it work , " said gottrick wewer , of the german interior ministry .
foundation betters ties communication between the sides at all levels and at all points of contact could help .
german police and taxi drivers are supposed to learn english .
wewer told the guardian that the success of dealing with potentially violent fans at the euro 2004 in portugal should be a lesson to germany as well .
a low-key , but strong , police presence should lower the possibility of violence between england and germany supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legendary manchester city goalie , bernd " bert " trautmann , epitomizes peaceful relations between english and german soccer the bernd trautmann foundation , named after the legendary german goalkeeper at manchester city in the 1950 's , when the effects of world war ii were still omnipresent , looks to smooth out tensions between germans and english .
" we want to offer events in a world cup project that bring people together , " said matthias paskowsky , chairman of the foundation .
" our focus is on english fans and we want to make them feel particularly welcome . "
german interior minister otto schily does not want to leave any stone unturned though .
the fun for fans should n't be reduced by excessive security measures he said recently but hooligans can expect a zero tolerance strategy .
on may 25 , schily and the interior ministers of the 16 federal states will meet in stuttgart to hammer out a final plan so that in all 12 world cup cities , hooliganism will not be able to set root . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's english problem as berlin hopes to further boost foreign tourism ahead of the 2006 world cup , an undercover report by dw-world 's sonia phalnikar suggests that lacking language skills in the service sector might be the biggest problem .

bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .

ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .

bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad .

bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .

for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance . supporters of english soccer traveling abroad have long been accustomed to escorts by plainclothes british officers .
soon , they could have the feeling of being a little more at home when they travel to germany for next year 's world cup .
after talks with their german counterparts this week at the british embassy in berlin , british police officials are leaning towards sending uniformed police officers abroad for the first time .
david swift , the deputy chief constable of staffordshire believes recognizable policemen and women will help to defuse potential trouble .
" they would not have powers of arrest but they would be there in a sort of bobby-on-the-beat role , " swift , also the association of chief police officers ' official responsible for soccer disorder told the guardian .
" they would offer a familiar presence and help increase communication with supporters . "
an ounce of prevention police and security officials will take every precaution necessary in preventing violence between british and german fans .
about 3,000 blacklisted english supporters must surrender their passports ahead of world cup games according to information given the times .
overall , up to 80,000 england fans are expected to come to germany for the tournament .

in addition , the british foreign office will spend an additional 500,000 british pounds -lrb- 725,000 euros -rrb- to beef up its consular operation in germany .
with strong security measures in and around the stadiums , many are more concerned about what could happen at public venues , where hundreds of fans can gather to watch the game .
one official told the the times that german hooligans , most of whom wo n't get tickets , could pick fights while drinking in public in front of any one of the thousands of big screen televisions that will be set up in bars across the country .
large scenes of hooligans rioting in berlin would blemish the cup 's image immensely , something german police officials are all too aware of .
" billions of people will be watching the cup .
we have to do everything to make it work , " said gottrick wewer , of the german interior ministry .
foundation betters ties communication between the sides at all levels and at all points of contact could help .
german police and taxi drivers are supposed to learn english .
wewer told the guardian that the success of dealing with potentially violent fans at the euro 2004 in portugal should be a lesson to germany as well .
a low-key , but strong , police presence should lower the possibility of violence between england and germany supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legendary manchester city goalie , bernd " bert " trautmann , epitomizes peaceful relations between english and german soccer the bernd trautmann foundation , named after the legendary german goalkeeper at manchester city in the 1950 's , when the effects of world war ii were still omnipresent , looks to smooth out tensions between germans and english .
" we want to offer events in a world cup project that bring people together , " said matthias paskowsky , chairman of the foundation .
" our focus is on english fans and we want to make them feel particularly welcome . "

back to first page back 2/2 got the power la repubblica is one of the few dailies that has dared to speak out against berlusconi .
one of the reasons it 's so outspoken is its owner , carlo dibenedetti , who once tried to buy italy 's second-largest publishing house , mondadore .
instead , berlusconi took control of it by bribing judges , david lane said .
but newspapers do n't have a great deal of influence on the italian public .
la repubblica and l 'unita , the two main papers openly critical of italy 's leader , have a combined circulation of less than 800,000 .
the real power lies in television .
berlusconi 's three privately owned channels are renowned for combining fluffy entertainment with fawning political talk shows .
this lightweight , fun and games combo has been key to swaying a lot of voters , said giovanni valentini .
" and we know that about 6 percent of the voters vote under the influence of television .
this 6 percent is about 3 million people , " valentini said .
" in the last political elections , we had about 600,000 votes between center-left and center-right .
this is the problem . "
voters not convinced but it may not be as big as critics have feared .
in april regional elections across the country voters voiced their widespread dissatisfaction with berlusconi and his government .
candidates from opposition parties swept into power in 11 out of 13 regions .
with national elections a year away , voters have shown they 're no longer so amenable to berlusconi 's self-serving laws and poor handling of the economy .
nor do they buy his recent explanation for the bad economic outlook - that italians do n't work hard enough and vacation to much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do italians spend to much time on holiday ?
even tv appearances are n't helping this time , according to tommaso dibenedetti .
" berlusconi is now over-exposed .
and his credibility is really , really weak . "
but it 's not just a question of overexposure .
as giovanni valentini said , promotion only works if the product is good .
" but when the product is old , is not good , is bad , television is not enough . "
and now that italians are feeling the pinch in their pocketbooks , it seems they may be ready to change the channel . megan williams , rome -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi forms new government italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced a new government saturday , leaving key ministries untouched while bringing in his longtime ally and former economy minister giulio tremonti as deputy premier .

" they would offer a familiar presence and help increase communication with supporters . "
an ounce of prevention police and security officials will take every precaution necessary in preventing violence between british and german fans .

even worse , lane said , berlusconi has wasted precious energy as a leader claiming he 's the victim of a political witch hunt . " he 's always maintained that the foreign press is in league with the centre-left opposition , " lane said .
" and despite the fact that the economist is a notoriously right-wing magazine , he seems to believe that we , in common with other newspapers and magazines from outside italy , are out to get him . "
" never , never , never … " in his first appearance as prime minister on public network , rai , which he now controls , he said the plot against him does n't stop with left wingers and the foreign press .
it includes , well , almost everyone .
" i 've always contended that there 's the official state and then a parallel state made up of powerful segments of society that are in the hands of the left , " berlusconi said .
" they include high schools , universities , newspapers , radios , television , judges , the constitutional court , and i 'll stop here simply to be charitable to my homeland .
some italians understand this , but the rest need to see this , too . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai logo berlusconi went even further , saying that with the exception of one newscaster , emilio fede , a notorious berlusconi cheerleader , his tv channels are unpartisan , and " there have never been attacks on my political rivals . " " it 's an amazing lie because berlusconi last year had important italian journalists , such as michele santoro , enzo biagi , fired from public television , " explained tommaso dibenedetti .
the columnist said berlusconi 's favorite method of silencing critics is by firing them .
but he 's also turned to the courts to put a chill on political debate . giovanni valentini , a journalist at rome 's la repubblica daily , is one of the many berlusconi is suing .
in the article in question , valentini identified the prime minister 's conflict of interest in pocketing $ 3 million -lrb- 3.8 million euros -rrb- from tv ads a year .
" do n't forget that he 's the strongest political man in europe , one thousand times richer than the american president , " valentini stressed .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .
but i withdrew my membership a few years ago and i ’ m now looking for a new political direction . " most of the guests , however , are already members of the cdu , or , at least , strong supporters .
they are here to demonstrate their political determination and unity .
because as far as they are concerned , it ’ s high time that the cdu won against the spd which has been in power in the state for 39 years . " i think that the spd looks tired after 39 years in power , " one man says .
" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .
it is necessary to have a completely different political landscape , something totally new .
i think the social democrats are exhausted , they need a break , and i believe that the christian democrats would be able to change things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers to the strains of europe 's 80 's rock standard ' the final countdown ' , the cdu ’ s jürgen rüttgers enters and people rise from their chairs , applauding , while the sound system pumps the soft rock anthem throughout the hall .
it ’ s a bit like the emotionally charged party meetings in the united states .
and just like other political parties would , at such an event , the cdu is self-congratulatory . rüttgers ’ speech is what you ’ d expect of the candidate : strong criticism of the spd ’ s performance in the state of north rhine-westphalia , in the four decades since the cdu was last into power . significant numbers are unhappy with the spd a significant number of the 18 million people in north rhine-westphalia are unhappy .
unemployment is so high that there are some cities in the state where one in four people are out of work .
but the state is also burdened with a large budget deficit .
schools and universities have no money .
and many shops , hospitals and factories have had to close down .
the people on the streets are frustrated . " i ’ ve got the feeling that there ’ s no progress at all in north rhine-westphalia , and that everything is getting worse , " says one disgruntled resident . things used to be different .
the geographical heart of north rhine-westphalia , the densely-populated ruhrgebiet , was once the industrial centre of germany .
the coal and steel industry characterised the region and its economy and landscape for decades , and it shaped the people living here . most of them were strong supporters of the spd .
it was once said that north-rhine westphalia was the workers ’ state .
but over the years , the majority of jobs in the coal and steel industry here have been cut .
now , only 40,000 miners are left - of what used to be more than 500,000 .
it ’ s a process of social transition that could make itself felt at the north rhine-westphalia elections . splinter groups formed by disillusioned socialists bildunterschrift : there are currently four parties in north rhine westphalia ’ s state parliament : the spd and the greens form the ruling coalition .
and in the opposition there ’ s the cdu and fdp – the free democratic party .
but many spd members are dissatisfied with their own party .
and recently , a splinter group - together with lobbyists and members of non-governmental organisations - formed a new party : the wasg .
but they ’ ve yet to make an impact . wasg stands for wahlalternative arbeit und soziale gerechtigkeit , a loose translation of which would be the alternative party for work and social equality .
but many people in north-rhine westphalia have no idea what the wasg is .
according to opinion polls , the wasg is unlikely to get more than 2 percent of the vote .
but wasg party members are optimistic , says top candidate jürgen klute : " we ’ ve found candidates for all of the 128 constituencies .
and we ’ re building our hopes on that . " wasg attempting to provide an alternative klute is a priest who deals with social and work issues in the city of herne , which is at the heart of the ruhrgebiet .
he worked as a miner himself in the 1980s and knows the people of north rhine-westphalia and their needs well .
according to klute , the wasg wants to bridge the gap between rich and poor .
they want more social security and a reduction of weekly working hours to get more people working again . " we ’ re aiming those who don ’ t usually vote .
often , in the ruhrgebiet , people who disagree with the current state of politics don ’ t then vote for the cdu or even right-wing parties – that is , until now .
but , instead , they tend to stay at home , " klute says .
" we ’ re aiming to be a left-wing alternative for these people - before they go and vote for a right-wing party .

but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike . it ’ s early evening on a monday .
some 300 people have come to a small community hall in the city of meckenheim , south of the former german capital of bonn .
there ’ s a live saxophonist and beer and pretzels are available to those in attendance . but this is just a musical prelude .
the people here , in meckenheim , are waiting for jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- candidate for the state premiership .
most of those waiting are men in their 50s and 60s .
there are only a few women and very few young people : " i support the ideas of the cdu , " says one female supporter .
" i think , if you look at north rhine-westphalia and also at the federal government , there are things that need to be changed .
if you take the unemployment rate , for instance , or the education policy here , then i think that the cdu is a better choice . " this young woman is a member of the ' junge union ' – the ' youth union ' representing young members of the cdu .
she strongly supports her party .
but there are other people here tonight who are still unsure about who to vote for on the may 22nd . " i haven ’ t decided yet , " another lady told dw-radio .
" i ’ d like to listen to rüttgers tonight .
i used to be a member of the spd .

" it ’ s about high time that north rhine-westphalia got a new government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.05.2005 fear and confusion on the campaign trail back to first page back 2/2 at the last state elections in 2000 , more than 40 percent of the electorate didn ’ t vote , which was an increase of 26 percent on 30 years ago .
the number of non-voters in the state has become so significant that it could have an impact on the final election result in north rhine-westphalia .
opinion polls have shown the cdu to be ahead of the spd for weeks .
but the spd is slowly catching up again .
so , it could be a neck-to-neck race - in which case , every vote will count .
and the parties are fighting for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election campaign has given rise to the first political tv-duel in the history of state elections in germany .
state premier peer steinbrück , of the spd , and his cdu rival jürgen rüttgers , have been invited to go head-to-head live on tv - more than once . at times , the debate has been lively , and sometimes heated .
but the main topics remain : the state budget , unemployment figures , education , and , of course , energy issues and the future of coal mining . media circus causes mixed feelings in electorate for the people of north rhine-westphalia , such media events are a mixed affair .
" it is interesting to see both candidates confronting each other and answering the questions .
i think that ’ s a good thing , " says one lady .
" and i think that people who are not so familiar with politics can get to know the candidates better , and can then come to a decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i believe that if people are really interested in politics , they don ’ t need tv debates .
but since – unfortunately - this is a modern election campaign , it ’ s a typical thing to do , " a male viewer comments .
" but i ’ m sceptical .
if you want to get good information , you have to read the party manifestos .
that ’ s much better . " but not many voters read party manifestos .
and according to political analysts , tv-duels , and similar media events , could have an impact on the outcome of the election .
this explains why the cdu has been accused of using another recent media event , at national level to target votes .
it was a parliamentary inquiry into germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer , and his ministry , which was broadcast live on tv . cdu accused of employing opportunistic tactics the inquiry which was headed by the cdu claimed that the federal government ’ s visa policy was too liberal and had caused an influx of criminals into germany .
but just how influential the inquiry will be is unclear .
richard hilmer , managing director of the think tank infratest-dimap has dismissed concerns : " the topic won ’ t harm the reputation of the red-green government .
in fact , i don ’ t think the spd or the greens will face a setback . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering regardless of that , the spd ’ s party chief , franz müntefering , has launched a counter attack .
he ’ s criticised international businesses and their bosses , describing their practises as asocial and unfair .
he even compared foreign investors to a swarm of locusts .
and it ’ s sparked a massive public reaction – dubbed ‘ the capitalism debate ’ . ' locust ' outburst respected but suspicions remain " it ’ s true , in fact , that a large majority of the population supports his criticism , " hilmer adds , " even traditional cdu / csu and fdp supporters .
but people are suspicious of his timing : five weeks before the election , at a time , when the spd isn ’ t doing too well .
a large majority sees the debate as political tactics before the election . " but the state election in north rhine-westphalia continues to draw unprecedented attention from federal politicians because this is the last state governed by the spd-green party coalition .
if it loses its majority here , it will send aftershocks to berlin and seriously damage the national red-green coalition of chancellor gerhard schröder .
a feeling shared on the streets : " i think the election in north rhine-westphalia will have a great impact on the federal parliamentary elections in 2006 , " says one woman .
" if there ’ s a change of power here , i think that would give a new momentum to the federal elections . " a mood for change may be misread so , people across germany will be watching closely .

the number of non-voters in the state has become so significant that it could have an impact on the final election result in north rhine-westphalia .
opinion polls have shown the cdu to be ahead of the spd for weeks .
but the spd is slowly catching up again .
so , it could be a neck-to-neck race - in which case , every vote will count .
and the parties are fighting for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election campaign has given rise to the first political tv-duel in the history of state elections in germany .
state premier peer steinbrück , of the spd , and his cdu rival jürgen rüttgers , have been invited to go head-to-head live on tv - more than once . at times , the debate has been lively , and sometimes heated .
but the main topics remain : the state budget , unemployment figures , education , and , of course , energy issues and the future of coal mining . media circus causes mixed feelings in electorate for the people of north rhine-westphalia , such media events are a mixed affair .
" it is interesting to see both candidates confronting each other and answering the questions .
i think that ’ s a good thing , " says one lady .
" and i think that people who are not so familiar with politics can get to know the candidates better , and can then come to a decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i believe that if people are really interested in politics , they don ’ t need tv debates .
but since – unfortunately - this is a modern election campaign , it ’ s a typical thing to do , " a male viewer comments .
" but i ’ m sceptical .
if you want to get good information , you have to read the party manifestos .
that ’ s much better . " but not many voters read party manifestos .
and according to political analysts , tv-duels , and similar media events , could have an impact on the outcome of the election .
this explains why the cdu has been accused of using another recent media event , at national level to target votes .
it was a parliamentary inquiry into germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer , and his ministry , which was broadcast live on tv . cdu accused of employing opportunistic tactics the inquiry which was headed by the cdu claimed that the federal government ’ s visa policy was too liberal and had caused an influx of criminals into germany .
but just how influential the inquiry will be is unclear .
richard hilmer , managing director of the think tank infratest-dimap has dismissed concerns : " the topic won ’ t harm the reputation of the red-green government .
in fact , i don ’ t think the spd or the greens will face a setback . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering regardless of that , the spd ’ s party chief , franz müntefering , has launched a counter attack .
he ’ s criticised international businesses and their bosses , describing their practises as asocial and unfair .
he even compared foreign investors to a swarm of locusts .
and it ’ s sparked a massive public reaction – dubbed ‘ the capitalism debate ’ . ' locust ' outburst respected but suspicions remain " it ’ s true , in fact , that a large majority of the population supports his criticism , " hilmer adds , " even traditional cdu / csu and fdp supporters .
but people are suspicious of his timing : five weeks before the election , at a time , when the spd isn ’ t doing too well .
a large majority sees the debate as political tactics before the election . " but the state election in north rhine-westphalia continues to draw unprecedented attention from federal politicians because this is the last state governed by the spd-green party coalition .
if it loses its majority here , it will send aftershocks to berlin and seriously damage the national red-green coalition of chancellor gerhard schröder .
a feeling shared on the streets : " i think the election in north rhine-westphalia will have a great impact on the federal parliamentary elections in 2006 , " says one woman .
" if there ’ s a change of power here , i think that would give a new momentum to the federal elections . " a mood for change may be misread so , people across germany will be watching closely .
but as richard hilmer reminds , the election is not over until the last vote is cast : " there is definitely a mood for change .
but i would be careful to say that the election is already over .
because in the polls ahead of the elections in the state of schleswig-holstein , in february , we saw that the ruling party was way ahead until one week before the election .
but in the end it was defeated . " in that election , the spd ’ s heidi simonis , lost her seat - and then her job .
that is a series of events that spd politicians in north-rhine westphalia will be eager to avoid . svenja üing -lrb- nda -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hits trail to save key election german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was to make a last-ditch effort to help his social democratic party hold onto power in the key state of north rhine-westphalia in elections sunday .

there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes . there was heart break at the gottlieb daimler stadium in stuttgart on saturday as matthias sammer 's team watched their dreams of champions league soccer crumble as they were turned over in a romping 3-1 defeat at the hands of bundesliga winners bayern munich .
stuttgart had been in the top three for most of the season but the 3-1 home reverse against bayern saw them drop to fifth and into the uefa cup .
bayern had nothing to play for against stuttgart but showed a professional attitude in their win .
bayern coach felix magath was once a hero after delivering champions league football to stuttgart but his popularity plummeted further as he denied his former club a spot in europe 's premier competition .
" now we will have apple juice instead of champagne , " said stuttgart coach matthias sammer in the aftermath of defeat .
" after the season we have had finishing up in the uefa cup is not a good return . " former german international defender markus babbel did not mince his words after a poor defensive display at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
" we were shit , " fumed babbel .
" when we went 2-0 down our legs were like lead . " after missing out on the champions league for a second successive season stuttgart face the prospect of losing their star performers such as belarus winger alexander hlleb and german international kevin kuranyi .
" i do not want to answer rubbish questions about players ' futures , " raged sammer .
ballack masterminds stuttgart 's collapse the game looked beyond stuttgart as soon as bayern went ahead .
german international captain michael ballack scored in the 27th minute to put bayern in the lead and bosnian international hasan salihamidzic doubled the lead on the half hour mark .
dutch international roy makaay made it 3-0 after 72 minutes and stuttgart could draw little consolation from imre szabics 's reply with two minutes remaining as they fell to their lowest league position of the season on the last day .
makaay 's effort meant he scored nine goals in the last four games of the season but his tally of 22 was not enough to net the golden boot .
bildunterschrift : slovakian international marek mintal topped the scoring charts with the fc nuremberg midfielder scoring his 24th goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat by mainz 05 .
without mintal 's goalscoring feats promoted nuremberg would probably have been relegated but the trio of sc freiburg , hansa rostock and vfl bochum leave the 18-strong bundesliga .
schalke grab last gasp goal to qualify schalke 04 ended their rollercoaster season on a high with a 3-2 victory at sc freiburg on saturday to clinch second place and an automatic spot in next season 's champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after investing heavily in players schalke management demanded a spot in the money-spinning champions league and ralf rangnick 's side delivered with a tense win over freiburg .
ebbe sand scored in the sixth minute to put schalke on the right track but alexander iaschvili equalized five minutes later after a kind deflection off the post .
brazilian marcelo bordon then put schalke back in front on 55 minutes and netted again in the 89th minute after relegated freiburg had equalized for the second time .
schalke looked like going down the same path as stuttgart with their form dipping worryingly at the end of the season but the 3-2 win was enough to secure the second spot at the death .
" we have quality in the squad and a will to win but next season we need to improve , " explained coach ralf rangnick . schalke have invested heavily in player salaries over the past few seasons and the revenue from the champions league is much-needed . schalke can point to the fact that they beat bayern twice this season in the league but they have hardly impressed in europe . shakhtar donetsk knocked schalke out of this season 's uefa cup at the third round and there are much stronger teams in the champions league than the ukraine outfit . bremen leapfrog stuttgart and berlin into last slot deposed champions werder bremen join schalke in europe 's premier competition - although they must play in the qualifying round - snatching third place with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern before the start of play bremen were fifth but a dramatic finale saw them leapfrog vfb stuttgart and hertha berlin to net the third and final champions league berth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen qualified for the champions league as german champions last season but scraped into the competition through the back door this season with victory over kaiserslautern .
tim borowski and paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez shot bremen in to third after stuttgart 's defeat at bayern and hertha 's draw with hanover .
bremen 's 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern on saturday handed them a third place finish and late entry to the champions league . bremen 's late salvage job on what was a shaky 2005 season , following their league and cup double last year , prompted a quick response to any who were bold enough to suggest they have crept in through the back door . " if you finish third at the end you deserve it , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we had a good season and i think we deserve to be in the champions league . " after being hammered 10-2 on aggregate by french champions lyon - the heaviest aggregate defeat in champions league history - in the last sixteen of this season 's competition bremen clearly need to strengthen their squad . " the qualification will not affect our transfer policy , " said sporting director klaus allofs .
" we do not plan to use any champions league income to fund new players . " that is bad news for bremen who lost 11 matches to finish 18 points behind champions bayern this season , but fortunately for them stuttgart pressed the self-destruct button .
hertha rue misses , join leverkusen in uefa cup hertha could have secured third place with a home win over hanover but were left ruing a string of missed chances in a 0-0 draw .

the election is being seen as a test for a un-brokered peace deal , 16 years after rebels began a bloody campaign to secede from papua new guinea .
thousands of people are thought to have been killed in the rebellion .
bougainville 's fledgling administration will run the island , with papua new guinea 's federal government retaining control over defence and the economy .
the bougainville rebellion was the longest-running conflict in the south pacific .
it began as a dispute over land and alleged environmental damage between islanders and multi-national copper mining companies .
it became a brutal war of independence involving government forces , well-armed militias and foreign mercenaries .
boycott some estimates put the number of dead as high as 15,000 .
human rights organisations reported widespread abuses on both sides , including rape , torture and executions .
a peace agreement signed in august 2001 included provisions for greater self-government and eventually a referendum on independence .
this landmark election is a major test for that peace accord .
voting will last for a fortnight because of the island 's rugged terrain .
more than a 120,000 bougainvilleans have registered to vote .
some will have to walk for days or travel by canoe to reach polling stations .
around 250 candidates are contesting the 40 seats in the new autonomous assembly .
a president will also be elected .
the election is being seen as an important step towards independence .
the australian foreign minister alexander downer said it was a " momentous event " .
some former rebel fighters still do not recognise the peace process and have called on islanders to boycott the vote .

mr karzai said he was shocked and would raise the issue with president george w bush when he meets him next week .
the soldiers involved in the deaths of two inmates and alleged abuse of others should be punished , mr karzai said .
the allegations are detailed by the new york times citing a 2,000-page document leaked from a us army investigation .
" the us government must take strong and clear-cut action , " the afghan president told a news conference shortly before leaving for the united states .
quick guide afghanistan he said the alleged abuse was against humanity .
asked if he would be as forthright when he meets mr bush , he answered " absolutely " .
mr karzai , a us ally who came to power following the collapse of the taleban regime in late 2001 , has recently spoken of " us military mistakes " .
his four-day trip follows recent violent anti-us protests in afghanistan following allegations in newsweek magazine - now retracted - that us guards at guantanamo bay , cuba , had desecrated the koran .
public opinion the bbc 's andrew north in kabul says the afghan leader is taking a much more forceful stand than he has in the past towards the us , a country he still regards as indispensable to afghanistan .
it has shocked me totally ...
we want the us government to take very , very strong action afghan president hamid karzai our correspondent says his comments are a reflection of concern in kabul at the impact on afghan public opinion of the many different allegations of us abuses .
the new york-based organisation human rights watch says the afghan abuse allegations will not be adequately investigated or prosecuted until an independent commission deals with the issue .
officials in washington said the alleged abuses detailed in the new york times were being investigated and those responsible would be held to account .
seven us servicemen have already been charged in relation to the two deaths at bagram military base , north of kabul , in 2002 .
the new allegations relate to the level of abuse the two prisoners - known only as dilawar and habibullah - are said to have been subjected to .
' innocent man ' dilawar , 22 , was said to have been chained to a ceiling by his wrists for four days , and then beaten on his legs more than 100 times during a 24-hour period .
he was being questioned about an attack on a us air base , but the report says most interrogators believed him to be an innocent taxi driver who simply drove past at the time of the attack .
other reported abuses included : a prisoner being forced to kiss the boots of interrogators another prisoner being forced to pick plastic bottle tops out of a drum filled with excrement and water a female interrogator stepping on a man 's neck and kicking another in the genitals .
a pentagon spokesman said the new york times was trying to make a new story out of old material , adding that the investigation was " very serious and very detailed " .
" the standard has always been humane treatment for all detainees .
when that standard is not met we will take action , " the spokesman said .
the new york times said it received the report from a person involved in the us investigation who was critical of the interrogation methods used , and of a subsequent inquiry .
the us military initially said there was no indication of abuse in the two men 's deaths and that interrogation techniques were methods that were " generally accepted " .
after a later inquiry , last october , it emerged that 27 soldiers faced probable criminal charges .
among them are the seven who have since been charged .

seven us servicemen have already been charged in relation to the two deaths at bagram military base , north of kabul , in 2002 .
the new allegations relate to the level of abuse the two prisoners - known only as dilawar and habibullah - are said to have been subjected to .
' innocent man ' dilawar , 22 , was said to have been chained to a ceiling by his wrists for four days , and then beaten on his legs more than 100 times during a 24-hour period .
he was being questioned about an attack on a us air base , but the report says most interrogators believed him to be an innocent taxi driver who simply drove past at the time of the attack .
other reported abuses included : a prisoner being forced to kiss the boots of interrogators another prisoner being forced to pick plastic bottle tops out of a drum filled with excrement and water a female interrogator stepping on a man 's neck and kicking another in the genitals .
a pentagon spokesman said the new york times was trying to make a new story out of old material , adding that the investigation was " very serious and very detailed " .
" the standard has always been humane treatment for all detainees .
when that standard is not met we will take action , " the spokesman said .
the new york times said it received the report from a person involved in the us investigation who was critical of the interrogation methods used , and of a subsequent inquiry .
the us military initially said there was no indication of abuse in the two men 's deaths and that interrogation techniques were methods that were " generally accepted " .
after a later inquiry , last october , it emerged that 27 soldiers faced probable criminal charges .
among them are the seven who have since been charged .

as a result of recent increases in world metal prices , owners anglesey mining plc are starting exploratory drilling work .
finance director ian cuthbertson said they were confident of " significant reserves " at the site , which has been mined since the bronze age .
it could lead to more than 100 jobs at the site , near amlwch .
" there have been quite a number of attempts to revive -lsb- mining at the site -rsb- , but the world situation now is different and we are upbeat about the prospects , " said mr cuthbertson .
he said that demand for metals from china was pushing up prices across the world . "
we will do our drilling and rework our calculations for the viability of the project " ian cuthbertson " at present metal prices , parys mountain will certainly be viable , the question is whether current metal prices will continue , " he said " we are confident there are significant reserves of zinc and copper .
our initial estimates of six million tonnes at 10 % metal could easily be on the low side .
" more than 100 people would be required as a minimum to operate the mine plus ancillary jobs off site . "
he said that , although the metal was expensive to retrieve , he was confident of securing finances " providing the numbers stack up " .
" this initial phase of drilling has been funded by funds from the stock exchange and a good proportion of any further monies is likely to come from the same source , " he said .
tv appearances " we will do our drilling and rework our calculations for the viability of the project , and we hope then to be in a position to go to the exchange and to banks and to finance the project and put it into operation . "
he said the future depended not necessarily on the drilling results , but the results of the feasibility studies and on the outlook for metal prices .
two years ago , millions of gallons of polluted water were drained from mine workings at the site .
copper mining had taken place at parys mountain for centuries , until it was brought to a halt in 1915 .
it has since been used as a location for tv programmes and science fiction films , and also featured on bbc 's restoration programme but lost out to llanelly house in llanelli in a viewer 's vote .

the pared down phones represents a backlash against the drive to create more and more advanced services .

a pre-paid handset will cost £ 80 while people opting for a monthly price plan will get the handset free .

older users the need for a simplified handset , especially for older people , is borne out by a survey conducted by consultancy firm cap gemini last year .

" simplicity was a big factor on consumers ' agendas but only a quarter of operators considered it important , " said jawad shaikh , head of the telecom and media lab at cap gemini .
the desire for an uncomplicated phone was greater as the age of users increased , its survey found .
eighty percent of the over-55s craved a simpler handset whereas youngsters wanted all the bells and whistles on their phones .
even on a more " dumbed-down " phone , there could still be a place for specifically targeted services to be added at a later date , said mr shaikh .
" for instance older people showed interest in health monitoring services .

if the whole mass of ice disappeared , the world 's sea level would rise by about six metres -lrb- 20ft -rrb- .
david shukman meets the nasa team who study the effects of climate change on the ground .
picture the scene of a tent half buried in snow , the arctic wind moaning and whistling , a small window letting in the pale light of midnight .
we are in the far north .
there are eight of us bunched around a table - five american scientists and our team of three .
we are warm in here , a gas heater fights the vicious cold outside .
this night the temperature falls to -17c -lrb- 1f -rrb- ; -30c -lrb- -22f -rrb- if you add the effect of the wind .
there is steam rising from our plates .
one of the senior scientists has just served up a meal of fried halibut .
it is delicious and we praise his skill handling the camping stove .
a bottle of wine is passed round and we swap stories .
it is a civilised , convivial scene and for a while i forget where i am . "
beyond the canvas there 's a wilderness of white - no lights , no roads , no life , just us " soon it is time for coffee and then i am brought back to reality .
to make the coffee , one of our hosts reaches for a dustbin and from it he scoops a load of snow which he tips into a pot .
this is our water supply .
this is no ordinary dinner party .
i have to pinch myself but we are actually camped on one of the largest masses of ice in the world .
beneath my chair there is a monumental glacial block , almost a mile thick .
and around us - and this is the unnerving bit - out beyond the canvas , past the array of scientific instruments enduring the storm , there 's a wilderness of white - 1,000 miles of ice-sheet .
no lights , no roads , no life , just us .
i turn down the offer of coffee and reach for the malt whisky instead .
beside me is the man who founded this research base 15 years ago .
a tall , genial professor , konrad steffen has the clear blue eyes , lined face and beard of a man who has spent long years in the arctic .
his colleagues say he is so tough he never feels the cold .
known by everyone as " koni " , his goal is simple - to make the most accurate measurements possible of what is really happening to the ice .
koni is not a man content to analyse other people 's data .
he once spent six months of the arctic winter recording the ice .
on another mission he repeatedly stayed awake for 24-hour periods to measure how much solar radiation was being reflected by the snow .
dinner over , we stumble through the snowdrifts to our tent and yearn for a little global warming .
vanishing horizon the next day the weather is still brutal . "
the ice sheet was always assumed to be so cold that to shift it you would need warmer conditions for hundreds or thousands of years " our camera jams , so does the back-up and even a third grinds to a halt .
an expedition by snowmobile leaves us shaking with cold .
the horizon vanishes in an unrelenting blast of white .
our plan was to stay just one night but the helicopter meant to pick us up can not make it .
we are stuck .
koni grins .
" it 's greenland , " he says .
the following days and nights roll into one .
we pass the time by working when we can , or burrowing into our sleeping bags or huddling by the gas fire .
one of our companions is another veteran ice scientist , jay zwally .
it was jay who had cooked so well the first night and now , thinking our morale needs lifting , he adds to our sense of the surreal by feeding us lobster .
' stuntman ' it is even better than the halibut .
our spirits lift and we coax more stories out of koni .
like the time a polar bear chased one of his huskies around his tent .
or when the ice he was camped on broke away and started drifting for the ocean .
koni 's only escape had been to rev up his snowmobile and , like a stuntman , jump the gap .
endeavours like this were what led these scientists to a major discovery .
the ice sheet was always assumed to be so cold that to shift it you would need warmer conditions for hundreds or thousands of years .
but research here has revealed a startling reality : that the ice sheet , which is always creeping downhill towards the coast , actually doubles in speed during the few weeks of summer .
the implications are huge .
getting to the truth the warmer the temperatures , the more rapidly enormous quantities of ice will reach the sea and so affect its level - worldwide .
eventually we spot a hint of horizon .
we pack up and wait for the helicopter .
we hear its drum beat approach but then retreat .
the pilot still can not land .
our faces drop .
" do n't worry , " announces jay , " i 'm doing sushi tonight . "
well , we never get to try it .
much later the helicopter does manage to lift us away .
jay and koni stand waving .
our stay lasted four days and i am desperate for a shower .
but , as the camp vanishes into the white below us , i realise i have learned something : all too often politicians and environmentalists make assumptions about climate change .
and out in the cold there is a small band of hardy scientists getting at the truth of it .

scientists at the camp use satellite signals to track how fast the ice sheet is melting and around us - and this is the unnerving bit - out beyond the canvas , past the array of scientific instruments enduring the storm , there 's a wilderness of white - 1,000 miles of ice-sheet .
no lights , no roads , no life , just us .
i turn down the offer of coffee and reach for the malt whisky instead .
beside me is the man who founded this research base 15 years ago .
a tall , genial professor , konrad steffen has the clear blue eyes , lined face and beard of a man who has spent long years in the arctic .
his colleagues say he is so tough he never feels the cold .
known by everyone as " koni " , his goal is simple - to make the most accurate measurements possible of what is really happening to the ice .
koni is not a man content to analyse other people 's data .
he once spent six months of the arctic winter recording the ice .
on another mission he repeatedly stayed awake for 24-hour periods to measure how much solar radiation was being reflected by the snow .
dinner over , we stumble through the snowdrifts to our tent and yearn for a little global warming .
vanishing horizon the next day the weather is still brutal .
the ice sheet was always assumed to be so cold that to shift it you would need warmer conditions for hundreds or thousands of years our camera jams , so does the back-up and even a third grinds to a halt .

our plan was to stay just one night but the helicopter meant to pick us up can not make it .
we are stuck .

we pass the time by working when we can , or burrowing into our sleeping bags or huddling by the gas fire .
one of our companions is another veteran ice scientist , jay zwally .
it was jay who had cooked so well the first night and now , thinking our morale needs lifting , he adds to our sense of the surreal by feeding us lobster .
' stuntman ' it is even better than the halibut .
our spirits lift and we coax more stories out of koni .
konrad steffen has spent long years in the arctic like the time a polar bear chased one of his huskies around his tent .
or when the ice he was camped on broke away and started drifting for the ocean .
koni 's only escape had been to rev up his snowmobile and , like a stuntman , jump the gap .
endeavours like this were what led these scientists to a major discovery .
the ice sheet was always assumed to be so cold that to shift it you would need warmer conditions for hundreds or thousands of years .
but research here has revealed a startling reality : that the ice sheet , which is always creeping downhill towards the coast , actually doubles in speed during the few weeks of summer .
the implications are huge .
getting to the truth the warmer the temperatures , the more rapidly enormous quantities of ice will reach the sea and so affect its level - worldwide .
eventually we spot a hint of horizon .
we pack up and wait for the helicopter .
we hear its drum beat approach but then retreat .
the pilot still can not land .
our faces drop .
" do n't worry , " announces jay , " i 'm doing sushi tonight . "
well , we never get to try it .
much later the helicopter does manage to lift us away .
jay and koni stand waving .
our stay lasted four days and i am desperate for a shower .
but , as the camp vanishes into the white below us , i realise i have learned something : all too often politicians and environmentalists make assumptions about climate change .
and out in the cold there is a small band of hardy scientists getting at the truth of it .

we are warm in here , a gas heater fights the vicious cold outside .
this night the temperature falls to -17c -lrb- 1f -rrb- ; -30c -lrb- -22f -rrb- if you add the effect of the wind .

if the whole mass of ice disappeared , the world 's sea level would rise by about six metres -lrb- 20ft -rrb- .
david shukman meets the nasa team who study the effects of climate change on the ground .
each iceberg contains millions of tonnes of water picture the scene of a tent half buried in snow , the arctic wind moaning and whistling , a small window letting in the pale light of midnight .
we are in the far north .
there are eight of us bunched around a table - five american scientists and our team of three .
we are warm in here , a gas heater fights the vicious cold outside .
this night the temperature falls to -17c -lrb- 1f -rrb- ; -30c -lrb- -22f -rrb- if you add the effect of the wind .
there is steam rising from our plates .
one of the senior scientists has just served up a meal of fried halibut .
it is delicious and we praise his skill handling the camping stove .
a bottle of wine is passed round and we swap stories .
it is a civilised , convivial scene and for a while i forget where i am .
beyond the canvas there 's a wilderness of white - no lights , no roads , no life , just us soon it is time for coffee and then i am brought back to reality .
to make the coffee , one of our hosts reaches for a dustbin and from it he scoops a load of snow which he tips into a pot .
this is our water supply .
this is no ordinary dinner party .
i have to pinch myself but we are actually camped on one of the largest masses of ice in the world .
beneath my chair there is a monumental glacial block , almost a mile thick .
scientists at the camp use satellite signals to track how fast the ice sheet is melting and around us - and this is the unnerving bit - out beyond the canvas , past the array of scientific instruments enduring the storm , there 's a wilderness of white - 1,000 miles of ice-sheet .
no lights , no roads , no life , just us .
i turn down the offer of coffee and reach for the malt whisky instead .
beside me is the man who founded this research base 15 years ago .
a tall , genial professor , konrad steffen has the clear blue eyes , lined face and beard of a man who has spent long years in the arctic .
his colleagues say he is so tough he never feels the cold .
known by everyone as " koni " , his goal is simple - to make the most accurate measurements possible of what is really happening to the ice .
koni is not a man content to analyse other people 's data .
he once spent six months of the arctic winter recording the ice .
on another mission he repeatedly stayed awake for 24-hour periods to measure how much solar radiation was being reflected by the snow .
dinner over , we stumble through the snowdrifts to our tent and yearn for a little global warming .
vanishing horizon the next day the weather is still brutal .
the ice sheet was always assumed to be so cold that to shift it you would need warmer conditions for hundreds or thousands of years our camera jams , so does the back-up and even a third grinds to a halt .
an expedition by snowmobile leaves us shaking with cold .
the horizon vanishes in an unrelenting blast of white .
our plan was to stay just one night but the helicopter meant to pick us up can not make it .
we are stuck .
koni grins .
" it 's greenland , " he says .
the following days and nights roll into one .
we pass the time by working when we can , or burrowing into our sleeping bags or huddling by the gas fire .
one of our companions is another veteran ice scientist , jay zwally .
it was jay who had cooked so well the first night and now , thinking our morale needs lifting , he adds to our sense of the surreal by feeding us lobster .
' stuntman ' it is even better than the halibut .
our spirits lift and we coax more stories out of koni .
konrad steffen has spent long years in the arctic like the time a polar bear chased one of his huskies around his tent .
or when the ice he was camped on broke away and started drifting for the ocean .
koni 's only escape had been to rev up his snowmobile and , like a stuntman , jump the gap .
endeavours like this were what led these scientists to a major discovery .
the ice sheet was always assumed to be so cold that to shift it you would need warmer conditions for hundreds or thousands of years .
but research here has revealed a startling reality : that the ice sheet , which is always creeping downhill towards the coast , actually doubles in speed during the few weeks of summer .
the implications are huge .
getting to the truth the warmer the temperatures , the more rapidly enormous quantities of ice will reach the sea and so affect its level - worldwide .
eventually we spot a hint of horizon .
we pack up and wait for the helicopter .
we hear its drum beat approach but then retreat .
the pilot still can not land .
our faces drop .
" do n't worry , " announces jay , " i 'm doing sushi tonight . "
well , we never get to try it .
much later the helicopter does manage to lift us away .
jay and koni stand waving .
our stay lasted four days and i am desperate for a shower .
but , as the camp vanishes into the white below us , i realise i have learned something : all too often politicians and environmentalists make assumptions about climate change .
and out in the cold there is a small band of hardy scientists getting at the truth of it .

saturday 's manchester united-arsenal final is due to be the last final to be staged at the millennium stadium while a new wembley is built .
marketing firm cardiff initiative said each final brought £ 15m to the city .
cardiff council and millennium stadium staff are now working to ensure the loss of the events is minimised .
the millennium stadium has annually hosted the fa cup final , the community shield , the carling cup final and three play-off finals as part of its deal with the fa , which is due to run out this year .
rumours that it may host the 2006 fa cup final because wembley will not be ready in time have been denied .
in april , cardiff also hosted the fa cup semi-finals , which cardiff initiative said brought in £ 7m over one weekend .
the firm also said that 10 % of people who attended an event in the city returned for a short break .
in addition to the economic gains , the events have also given cardiff and the millennium stadium a worldwide profile , with the fa cup final alone having an estimated global audience of 600 million .
manager paul sergeant said the stadium was on the global map cardiff initiative added that , in the last four years , there had been a 30 % increase in the number of hotels , 25 % rise in stores , 35 % in bars and 20 % in restaurants in cardiff .
if at least some of this expansion is due to the football , the question of how to sustain it is now being addressed .
cardiff councillor nigel howells , the executive member for sport , said the authority was working to ensure there was no gap left in the city 's marketing strategy .
" we always knew the fa cup was going to go to wembley once -lrb- the new stadium -rrb- was complete , " he said .
" we have got an exciting 18 months ahead - we have recently had the announcement that the heineken cup will be coming to cardiff and the millennium stadium next year and that is anticipated to bring around £ 30m into the local economy .
" on top of that , we have four internationals in the autumn and the three six nations rugby internationals in the springtime . "
millennium stadium manager paul sergeant said the loss of the football had been factored into their event planning .
" what it -lsb- the football -rsb- has done for us is put us on the global map , " he said .
