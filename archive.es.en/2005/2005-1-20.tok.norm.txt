wolfsburg led much of the first leg before faltering in the last few matches .
still they stand in fourth place .
dortmund , who won the league title in 2002 , are just four points away from the relegation zone .
another traditional powerhouse struggling this season is kaiserslautern .
their starting goalkeeper tim wiese is out and so they signed austrian jürgen macho to take his place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the kaiserslautern logo be in the first division next year ?
up front they also have problems .
" it is not an exaggeration to say our whole offense kaiserslautern might be out , " coach kurt jara told kicker magazine .
kaiserslautern travels to nuremberg .
berlin looks to continue string falko götz 's hertha berlin squad finished the first leg on a high note .
since the end of october they did not lose a single match .
now they find themselves even on points with fifth-place bremen .
to start the second half of the season , they must travel to bochum on sunday .
bochum has been wallowing in the relegation zone most of the first leg .
one thing that favors peter neururer 's side is bochum 's startling success against berlin - they have won 14 of 16 matches .
bochum has sought to improve their decimated goalkeeping situation by bringing in danish international keeper petr skov-jensen .
also on sunday , hanover hosts leverkusen .
a lot is riding on this match for both squads if they want to stay in the hunt for a spot in european club competition .
hanover had a surprisingly strong first leg and lie in seventh place .
eighth place leverkusen have played well in the champions league and would like to now carry that over to the bundesliga . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far read all the coverage of the first leg in the bundesliga 9800 dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

while some in germany will hit the streets , demonstrators really want their voices to be heard during the president ’ s february visit . candlelight vigils , street protests and a mardi gras-like parade are some of the events that will bring out hundreds of people in germany to express their unhappiness with the american president at anti-inauguration activities around the country .
want to do something positive “ we felt there would be a lot of negative feelings coming up now if we didn ’ t do something positive , ” said ronald schlundt , chairman of the german chapter of democrats abroad , who will be attending an anti-inauguration parade in the village of ramstein .
democrats abroad will be holding counter-inaugural events in 24 countries around the world , schlundt added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were needed to keep protesters in check during bush 's last visit to germany in 2002 berlin ’ s brandenburg gate is the hub of two other events .
on wednesday night , the berlin district of democrats abroad held a candlelight vigil and on thursday , the day of the inauguration , vote x , an anti-bush group formed before the election , and other groups critical of the bush administration will demonstrate near the landmark with the slogan “ you ’ ve got a voice . ”
important to show discontent while the inauguration tends to be big news in the us , it doesn ’ t generally pull in a large foreign crowd .
indeed , it ’ s the president ’ s visit on february 23 that has really grabbed germans ’ attention .
bush has vowed to try to reach out to europe in an effort to smooth over differences opened by the iraq war during next month 's journey through belgium , germany , england and slovakia .

wolfsburg led much of the first leg before faltering in the last few matches .
still they stand in fourth place .
dortmund , who won the league title in 2002 , are just four points away from the relegation zone .
another traditional powerhouse struggling this season is kaiserslautern .
their starting goalkeeper tim wiese is out and so they signed austrian jürgen macho to take his place .

kaiserslautern travels to nuremberg .
berlin looks to continue string falko götz 's hertha berlin squad finished the first leg on a high note .
since the end of october they did not lose a single match .
now they find themselves even on points with fifth-place bremen .
to start the second half of the season , they must travel to bochum on sunday .
bochum has been wallowing in the relegation zone most of the first leg .
one thing that favors peter neururer 's side is bochum 's startling success against berlin - they have won 14 of 16 matches .
bochum has sought to improve their decimated goalkeeping situation by bringing in danish international keeper petr skov-jensen .
also on sunday , hanover hosts leverkusen .
a lot is riding on this match for both squads if they want to stay in the hunt for a spot in european club competition .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .

the committee of european securities regulators are concerned that a possible takeover would make regulation in the sector more difficult .
" the more cross-border stock exchange mergers there are , the more difficult it will be for regulators to control them with current means , " cesr general secretary fabrice demarigny told the business daily handelsblatt in an interview .
cesr , set up in 2001 by the european commission , is a body whose members are stock market regulators from all eu countries .
demarigny said that should it come to a single european market , then it would require a single regulator .
deutsche börse is competing with archrival euronext to take over the lse .
the shareholders of deutsche börse have had mixed reactions to the plans so far . dw-world.de shareholders oppose deutsche börse 's lse plans deutsche börse , the company which runs the frankfurt stock exchange , is facing shareholder opposition in its proposed takeover of the london stock exchange .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .

currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .
conscripts keep costs down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the ruling social democratic party , praised the draft system as a way of keeping the army 's costs down .
a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .
but some parliamentary leaders have already made up their minds and want to enact a law that would do away with the conscription system by the end of this year .

a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .

the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .

while some in germany will hit the streets , demonstrators really want their voices to be heard during the president ’ s february visit . candlelight vigils , street protests and a mardi gras-like parade are some of the events that will bring out hundreds of people in germany to express their unhappiness with the american president at anti-inauguration activities around the country .
want to do something positive “ we felt there would be a lot of negative feelings coming up now if we didn ’ t do something positive , ” said ronald schlundt , chairman of the german chapter of democrats abroad , who will be attending an anti-inauguration parade in the village of ramstein .
democrats abroad will be holding counter-inaugural events in 24 countries around the world , schlundt added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were needed to keep protesters in check during bush 's last visit to germany in 2002 berlin ’ s brandenburg gate is the hub of two other events .
on wednesday night , the berlin district of democrats abroad held a candlelight vigil and on thursday , the day of the inauguration , vote x , an anti-bush group formed before the election , and other groups critical of the bush administration will demonstrate near the landmark with the slogan “ you ’ ve got a voice . ”
important to show discontent while the inauguration tends to be big news in the us , it doesn ’ t generally pull in a large foreign crowd .
indeed , it ’ s the president ’ s visit on february 23 that has really grabbed germans ’ attention .
bush has vowed to try to reach out to europe in an effort to smooth over differences opened by the iraq war during next month 's journey through belgium , germany , england and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during his february visit , bush , will meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder german protesters are hoping to make sure the president doesn ’ t have too easy of a time convincing europe ’ s politicians that the transatlantic rift has healed .
many of those critical of the united states feel they can not rely on the german government to express their indignation about bush ’ s policies .
“ it is important for people to show bush that the path he is on is wrong and very dangerous , we can not expect the government to do it for us , ” said peter strutynski of germany ’ s federal committee peace counsel .
“ they have been sending signals that they are willing to work with washington . ”
more reasons to fight on the way although they disagree with bush ’ s politics , attac , an anti-globalization group , is not planning any protests in connection with the inauguration , but it is one of many organizations planning to call for its members to take part in demonstrations when bush comes to germany , spokesperson malte kreutzfeldt said .
the groups are hoping for a large turnout at demonstrations next month as a way of showing the world that europe can act independently of american influence .
“ we can not give the impression that bush is right and that he will be able to get his partners behind him again , ” strutynski said .
“ we have to destroy the message that he will be able to win back his old nato allies . ”
keep bush out of berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration organizers will be hoping for a large turnout during bush 's visit to mainz demonstrators will have already notched up one success when bush comes to germany : ensuring that he is not received in the german capital . the president ’ s itinerary has him visiting the southern german city of mainz .
“ i think our demonstrations two years ago played a role in keeping bush out of berlin , ” strutynski said .
“ this time we want to show him that he is not welcome and that we do not want any part of his politics . ”
the groups agree that even though the democratic candidate john kerry lost last november ’ s election , they will continue to fight as the opposition party .
“ when i think about the election , i throw up my hands because we ’ re stuck with bush , ” democrats abroad member eva adams said .
“ but i ’ m not going to just roll over and take everything he wants to do . ” sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a new republican era ?

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .
to put it simply , like european professional athletes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges will have the last word on player quotas in the eu not just athletes from eastern european countries such russia , belarus or ukraine would benefit .
sportsmen and women from many african countries , the caribbean , and the pacific rim could play without restriction in any european sports league .
the foundation is the cotonou agreement from june 2000 .
the german sports association -lrb- dsv -rrb- is not thrilled about such prospects .
dsv vice-president christa thiel says that the quotas were implemented to give younger german athletes the opportunity to play .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .
to put it simply , like european professional athletes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges will have the last word on player quotas in the eu not just athletes from eastern european countries such russia , belarus or ukraine would benefit .
sportsmen and women from many african countries , the caribbean , and the pacific rim could play without restriction in any european sports league .
the foundation is the cotonou agreement from june 2000 .
the german sports association -lrb- dsv -rrb- is not thrilled about such prospects .
dsv vice-president christa thiel says that the quotas were implemented to give younger german athletes the opportunity to play .
others say that the influx of players from abroad , assuming they are top-notch , only help to strengthen german athletes . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .
to put it simply , like european professional athletes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges will have the last word on player quotas in the eu not just athletes from eastern european countries such russia , belarus or ukraine would benefit .
sportsmen and women from many african countries , the caribbean , and the pacific rim could play without restriction in any european sports league .

the german sports association -lrb- dsv -rrb- is not thrilled about such prospects .
dsv vice-president christa thiel says that the quotas were implemented to give younger german athletes the opportunity to play .

currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .
conscripts keep costs down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the ruling social democratic party , praised the draft system as a way of keeping the army 's costs down .
a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .
but some parliamentary leaders have already made up their minds and want to enact a law that would do away with the conscription system by the end of this year .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .
proponents say it will now be easier to enforce existing animal rights laws .
-lrb- ma 18 , 2002 -rrb- high court rules in favor of muslim ritual the german consitutional court overturns a previous ruling barring muslim butchers from slaughtering animals according to their religious rites .
-lrb- jan 15 , 2002 -rrb- europe 's integration challenge how well europe 's governments have performed in integrating its foreign populations is very much up for debate .
dw-world looks at the growing integration challenge in germany and the rest of europe feedback do you agree with german animal rights activists , that muslims should first stun animals before slaughter ?
what about freedom of religion ?

the committee of european securities regulators are concerned that a possible takeover would make regulation in the sector more difficult .

cesr , set up in 2001 by the european commission , is a body whose members are stock market regulators from all eu countries .
demarigny said that should it come to a single european market , then it would require a single regulator .
deutsche börse is competing with archrival euronext to take over the lse .
the shareholders of deutsche börse have had mixed reactions to the plans so far . dw-world.de shareholders oppose deutsche börse 's lse plans deutsche börse , the company which runs the frankfurt stock exchange , is facing shareholder opposition in its proposed takeover of the london stock exchange .

currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .
conscripts keep costs down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the ruling social democratic party , praised the draft system as a way of keeping the army 's costs down .
a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .
but some parliamentary leaders have already made up their minds and want to enact a law that would do away with the conscription system by the end of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.01.2005 muslims , activists lock horns on animal slaughter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a germany- based turkish butcher takes part in the celebration the festival of sacrifice is held by muslims around the world each year at the end of the haj .
but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .
proponents say it will now be easier to enforce existing animal rights laws .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.01.2005 muslims , activists lock horns on animal slaughter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a germany- based turkish butcher takes part in the celebration the festival of sacrifice is held by muslims around the world each year at the end of the haj .
but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .
proponents say it will now be easier to enforce existing animal rights laws .
-lrb- ma 18 , 2002 -rrb- high court rules in favor of muslim ritual the german consitutional court overturns a previous ruling barring muslim butchers from slaughtering animals according to their religious rites .
-lrb- jan 15 , 2002 -rrb- europe 's integration challenge how well europe 's governments have performed in integrating its foreign populations is very much up for debate .
dw-world looks at the growing integration challenge in germany and the rest of europe feedback do you agree with german animal rights activists , that muslims should first stun animals before slaughter ?
what about freedom of religion ?

bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .

third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .

currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .
conscripts keep costs down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the ruling social democratic party , praised the draft system as a way of keeping the army 's costs down .
a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .
but some parliamentary leaders have already made up their minds and want to enact a law that would do away with the conscription system by the end of this year .
" it is finally time to reach a decision instead of apprehensively waiting for the next verdict , " green member of european parliament angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung on thursday .
" we do not need policies that just hang on to old dogmas .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .

russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .
to put it simply , like european professional athletes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges will have the last word on player quotas in the eu not just athletes from eastern european countries such russia , belarus or ukraine would benefit .
sportsmen and women from many african countries , the caribbean , and the pacific rim could play without restriction in any european sports league .
the foundation is the cotonou agreement from june 2000 .
the german sports association -lrb- dsv -rrb- is not thrilled about such prospects .
dsv vice-president christa thiel says that the quotas were implemented to give younger german athletes the opportunity to play .
others say that the influx of players from abroad , assuming they are top-notch , only help to strengthen german athletes . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .
conscripts keep costs down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the ruling social democratic party , praised the draft system as a way of keeping the army 's costs down .
a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

dortmund , who won the league title in 2002 , are just four points away from the relegation zone .
another traditional powerhouse struggling this season is kaiserslautern .

wolfsburg led much of the first leg before faltering in the last few matches .
still they stand in fourth place .
dortmund , who won the league title in 2002 , are just four points away from the relegation zone .
another traditional powerhouse struggling this season is kaiserslautern .
their starting goalkeeper tim wiese is out and so they signed austrian jürgen macho to take his place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the kaiserslautern logo be in the first division next year ?
up front they also have problems .
" it is not an exaggeration to say our whole offense kaiserslautern might be out , " coach kurt jara told kicker magazine .
kaiserslautern travels to nuremberg .
berlin looks to continue string falko götz 's hertha berlin squad finished the first leg on a high note .
since the end of october they did not lose a single match .
now they find themselves even on points with fifth-place bremen .
to start the second half of the season , they must travel to bochum on sunday .
bochum has been wallowing in the relegation zone most of the first leg .
one thing that favors peter neururer 's side is bochum 's startling success against berlin - they have won 14 of 16 matches .
bochum has sought to improve their decimated goalkeeping situation by bringing in danish international keeper petr skov-jensen .
also on sunday , hanover hosts leverkusen .
a lot is riding on this match for both squads if they want to stay in the hunt for a spot in european club competition .
hanover had a surprisingly strong first leg and lie in seventh place .
eighth place leverkusen have played well in the champions league and would like to now carry that over to the bundesliga . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far read all the coverage of the first leg in the bundesliga 9799 dw-tv europe live kick off !

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .

a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .
conscripts keep costs down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the ruling social democratic party , praised the draft system as a way of keeping the army 's costs down .
a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .
but some parliamentary leaders have already made up their minds and want to enact a law that would do away with the conscription system by the end of this year .
" it is finally time to reach a decision instead of apprehensively waiting for the next verdict , " green member of european parliament angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung on thursday .

currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .
conscripts keep costs down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the ruling social democratic party , praised the draft system as a way of keeping the army 's costs down .
a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .
but some parliamentary leaders have already made up their minds and want to enact a law that would do away with the conscription system by the end of this year .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .
to put it simply , like european professional athletes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges will have the last word on player quotas in the eu not just athletes from eastern european countries such russia , belarus or ukraine would benefit .
sportsmen and women from many african countries , the caribbean , and the pacific rim could play without restriction in any european sports league .
the foundation is the cotonou agreement from june 2000 .
the german sports association -lrb- dsv -rrb- is not thrilled about such prospects .
dsv vice-president christa thiel says that the quotas were implemented to give younger german athletes the opportunity to play .
others say that the influx of players from abroad , assuming they are top-notch , only help to strengthen german athletes . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .

then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .

wolfsburg led much of the first leg before faltering in the last few matches .
still they stand in fourth place .
dortmund , who won the league title in 2002 , are just four points away from the relegation zone .
another traditional powerhouse struggling this season is kaiserslautern .
their starting goalkeeper tim wiese is out and so they signed austrian jürgen macho to take his place .

up front they also have problems .
" it is not an exaggeration to say our whole offense kaiserslautern might be out , " coach kurt jara told kicker magazine .
kaiserslautern travels to nuremberg .
berlin looks to continue string falko götz 's hertha berlin squad finished the first leg on a high note .
since the end of october they did not lose a single match .
now they find themselves even on points with fifth-place bremen .
to start the second half of the season , they must travel to bochum on sunday .
bochum has been wallowing in the relegation zone most of the first leg .
one thing that favors peter neururer 's side is bochum 's startling success against berlin - they have won 14 of 16 matches .
bochum has sought to improve their decimated goalkeeping situation by bringing in danish international keeper petr skov-jensen .
also on sunday , hanover hosts leverkusen .
a lot is riding on this match for both squads if they want to stay in the hunt for a spot in european club competition .
hanover had a surprisingly strong first leg and lie in seventh place .

currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .
conscripts keep costs down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the ruling social democratic party , praised the draft system as a way of keeping the army 's costs down .
a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .
but some parliamentary leaders have already made up their minds and want to enact a law that would do away with the conscription system by the end of this year .
" it is finally time to reach a decision instead of apprehensively waiting for the next verdict , " green member of european parliament angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung on thursday .
" we do not need policies that just hang on to old dogmas .

the committee of european securities regulators are concerned that a possible takeover would make regulation in the sector more difficult .
" the more cross-border stock exchange mergers there are , the more difficult it will be for regulators to control them with current means , " cesr general secretary fabrice demarigny told the business daily handelsblatt in an interview .
cesr , set up in 2001 by the european commission , is a body whose members are stock market regulators from all eu countries .
demarigny said that should it come to a single european market , then it would require a single regulator .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .
to put it simply , like european professional athletes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges will have the last word on player quotas in the eu not just athletes from eastern european countries such russia , belarus or ukraine would benefit .
sportsmen and women from many african countries , the caribbean , and the pacific rim could play without restriction in any european sports league .
the foundation is the cotonou agreement from june 2000 .
the german sports association -lrb- dsv -rrb- is not thrilled about such prospects .
dsv vice-president christa thiel says that the quotas were implemented to give younger german athletes the opportunity to play .
others say that the influx of players from abroad , assuming they are top-notch , only help to strengthen german athletes . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .

what did cause a small stir was how the game began .

the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .

he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

wolfsburg led much of the first leg before faltering in the last few matches .
still they stand in fourth place .
dortmund , who won the league title in 2002 , are just four points away from the relegation zone .
another traditional powerhouse struggling this season is kaiserslautern .
their starting goalkeeper tim wiese is out and so they signed austrian jürgen macho to take his place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the kaiserslautern logo be in the first division next year ?
up front they also have problems .
" it is not an exaggeration to say our whole offense kaiserslautern might be out , " coach kurt jara told kicker magazine .
kaiserslautern travels to nuremberg .
berlin looks to continue string falko götz 's hertha berlin squad finished the first leg on a high note .
since the end of october they did not lose a single match .
now they find themselves even on points with fifth-place bremen .
to start the second half of the season , they must travel to bochum on sunday .
bochum has been wallowing in the relegation zone most of the first leg .
one thing that favors peter neururer 's side is bochum 's startling success against berlin - they have won 14 of 16 matches .
bochum has sought to improve their decimated goalkeeping situation by bringing in danish international keeper petr skov-jensen .
also on sunday , hanover hosts leverkusen .
a lot is riding on this match for both squads if they want to stay in the hunt for a spot in european club competition .
hanover had a surprisingly strong first leg and lie in seventh place .
eighth place leverkusen have played well in the champions league and would like to now carry that over to the bundesliga . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far read all the coverage of the first leg in the bundesliga feedback who will be in the lead in the bundesliga after this weekend 's play - bayern or schalke ?

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .

schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .

the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .

third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .

while some in germany will hit the streets , demonstrators really want their voices to be heard during the president ’ s february visit . candlelight vigils , street protests and a mardi gras-like parade are some of the events that will bring out hundreds of people in germany to express their unhappiness with the american president at anti-inauguration activities around the country .
want to do something positive “ we felt there would be a lot of negative feelings coming up now if we didn ’ t do something positive , ” said ronald schlundt , chairman of the german chapter of democrats abroad , who will be attending an anti-inauguration parade in the village of ramstein .
democrats abroad will be holding counter-inaugural events in 24 countries around the world , schlundt added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were needed to keep protesters in check during bush 's last visit to germany in 2002 berlin ’ s brandenburg gate is the hub of two other events .
on wednesday night , the berlin district of democrats abroad held a candlelight vigil and on thursday , the day of the inauguration , vote x , an anti-bush group formed before the election , and other groups critical of the bush administration will demonstrate near the landmark with the slogan “ you ’ ve got a voice . ”
important to show discontent while the inauguration tends to be big news in the us , it doesn ’ t generally pull in a large foreign crowd .
indeed , it ’ s the president ’ s visit on february 23 that has really grabbed germans ’ attention .
bush has vowed to try to reach out to europe in an effort to smooth over differences opened by the iraq war during next month 's journey through belgium , germany , england and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during his february visit , bush , will meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder german protesters are hoping to make sure the president doesn ’ t have too easy of a time convincing europe ’ s politicians that the transatlantic rift has healed .
many of those critical of the united states feel they can not rely on the german government to express their indignation about bush ’ s policies .
“ it is important for people to show bush that the path he is on is wrong and very dangerous , we can not expect the government to do it for us , ” said peter strutynski of germany ’ s federal committee peace counsel .
“ they have been sending signals that they are willing to work with washington . ”
more reasons to fight on the way although they disagree with bush ’ s politics , attac , an anti-globalization group , is not planning any protests in connection with the inauguration , but it is one of many organizations planning to call for its members to take part in demonstrations when bush comes to germany , spokesperson malte kreutzfeldt said .
the groups are hoping for a large turnout at demonstrations next month as a way of showing the world that europe can act independently of american influence .
“ we can not give the impression that bush is right and that he will be able to get his partners behind him again , ” strutynski said .
“ we have to destroy the message that he will be able to win back his old nato allies . ”
keep bush out of berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration organizers will be hoping for a large turnout during bush 's visit to mainz demonstrators will have already notched up one success when bush comes to germany : ensuring that he is not received in the german capital . the president ’ s itinerary has him visiting the southern german city of mainz .
“ i think our demonstrations two years ago played a role in keeping bush out of berlin , ” strutynski said .
“ this time we want to show him that he is not welcome and that we do not want any part of his politics . ”
the groups agree that even though the democratic candidate john kerry lost last november ’ s election , they will continue to fight as the opposition party .
“ when i think about the election , i throw up my hands because we ’ re stuck with bush , ” democrats abroad member eva adams said .
“ but i ’ m not going to just roll over and take everything he wants to do . ” sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a new republican era ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.01.2005 court says draft system not unjust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscripts undergo basic training but do not serve abroad shifting defense priorities have resulted in only one third of german men having to serve nine months in the military , a process germany 's federal administrative court ruled is neither arbitrary nor prejudiced . the federal court in leipzig wednesday overturned a cologne regional court 's ruling that called the german army 's conscription system unjust .
currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .
conscripts keep costs down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the ruling social democratic party , praised the draft system as a way of keeping the army 's costs down .
a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .
but some parliamentary leaders have already made up their minds and want to enact a law that would do away with the conscription system by the end of this year .
" it is finally time to reach a decision instead of apprehensively waiting for the next verdict , " green member of european parliament angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung on thursday .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .
to put it simply , like european professional athletes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges will have the last word on player quotas in the eu not just athletes from eastern european countries such russia , belarus or ukraine would benefit .
sportsmen and women from many african countries , the caribbean , and the pacific rim could play without restriction in any european sports league .

the german sports association -lrb- dsv -rrb- is not thrilled about such prospects .

while some in germany will hit the streets , demonstrators really want their voices to be heard during the president ’ s february visit . candlelight vigils , street protests and a mardi gras-like parade are some of the events that will bring out hundreds of people in germany to express their unhappiness with the american president at anti-inauguration activities around the country .
want to do something positive “ we felt there would be a lot of negative feelings coming up now if we didn ’ t do something positive , ” said ronald schlundt , chairman of the german chapter of democrats abroad , who will be attending an anti-inauguration parade in the village of ramstein .
democrats abroad will be holding counter-inaugural events in 24 countries around the world , schlundt added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were needed to keep protesters in check during bush 's last visit to germany in 2002 berlin ’ s brandenburg gate is the hub of two other events .
on wednesday night , the berlin district of democrats abroad held a candlelight vigil and on thursday , the day of the inauguration , vote x , an anti-bush group formed before the election , and other groups critical of the bush administration will demonstrate near the landmark with the slogan “ you ’ ve got a voice . ”
important to show discontent while the inauguration tends to be big news in the us , it doesn ’ t generally pull in a large foreign crowd .
indeed , it ’ s the president ’ s visit on february 23 that has really grabbed germans ’ attention .
bush has vowed to try to reach out to europe in an effort to smooth over differences opened by the iraq war during next month 's journey through belgium , germany , england and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during his february visit , bush , will meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder german protesters are hoping to make sure the president doesn ’ t have too easy of a time convincing europe ’ s politicians that the transatlantic rift has healed .
many of those critical of the united states feel they can not rely on the german government to express their indignation about bush ’ s policies .
“ it is important for people to show bush that the path he is on is wrong and very dangerous , we can not expect the government to do it for us , ” said peter strutynski of germany ’ s federal committee peace counsel .
“ they have been sending signals that they are willing to work with washington . ”
more reasons to fight on the way although they disagree with bush ’ s politics , attac , an anti-globalization group , is not planning any protests in connection with the inauguration , but it is one of many organizations planning to call for its members to take part in demonstrations when bush comes to germany , spokesperson malte kreutzfeldt said .
the groups are hoping for a large turnout at demonstrations next month as a way of showing the world that europe can act independently of american influence .
“ we can not give the impression that bush is right and that he will be able to get his partners behind him again , ” strutynski said .
“ we have to destroy the message that he will be able to win back his old nato allies . ”
keep bush out of berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration organizers will be hoping for a large turnout during bush 's visit to mainz demonstrators will have already notched up one success when bush comes to germany : ensuring that he is not received in the german capital . the president ’ s itinerary has him visiting the southern german city of mainz .
“ i think our demonstrations two years ago played a role in keeping bush out of berlin , ” strutynski said .
“ this time we want to show him that he is not welcome and that we do not want any part of his politics . ”
the groups agree that even though the democratic candidate john kerry lost last november ’ s election , they will continue to fight as the opposition party .
“ when i think about the election , i throw up my hands because we ’ re stuck with bush , ” democrats abroad member eva adams said .

the committee of european securities regulators are concerned that a possible takeover would make regulation in the sector more difficult .
" the more cross-border stock exchange mergers there are , the more difficult it will be for regulators to control them with current means , " cesr general secretary fabrice demarigny told the business daily handelsblatt in an interview .
cesr , set up in 2001 by the european commission , is a body whose members are stock market regulators from all eu countries .
demarigny said that should it come to a single european market , then it would require a single regulator .
deutsche börse is competing with archrival euronext to take over the lse .
the shareholders of deutsche börse have had mixed reactions to the plans so far . dw-world.de shareholders oppose deutsche börse 's lse plans deutsche börse , the company which runs the frankfurt stock exchange , is facing shareholder opposition in its proposed takeover of the london stock exchange .

pfahls is said to be suffering from high blood pressure . despite being in the so-called " vip wing " of paris ' maison d 'arrêt de la santé prison , pfahls deplored the conditions there , saying there were cockroaches in his cell and saying the food was " just slightly better than in congo . " at least there are no cockroaches occasionally , the one-time wunderkind who had reached the highest echelons of german political society needed to share his cell with french criminals whose hygiene , he said , left something to be desired . the french authorities extradited the 61-year-old ex-minister on thursday -lrb- jan .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .
proponents say it will now be easier to enforce existing animal rights laws .
-lrb- ma 18 , 2002 -rrb- high court rules in favor of muslim ritual the german consitutional court overturns a previous ruling barring muslim butchers from slaughtering animals according to their religious rites .

currently , only about 58,000 of the 120,000 eligible draftees are called to serve .
conscripts do not take part in foreign military operations and usually perform administrative work .
the judges said the draft system allowed the state to adjust to real defense requirements and draft only those who are needed at any given time .
all women and certain groups of men are already exempt from conscription .
according to defense law , no one will be drafted if he ’ s over 24 years old , married or a father .
the court 's decision has revived the long-running debate about scrapping the conscription system and creating a professional army .

a professional army would cost between € 3.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- and € 7 billion more annually than keeping conscripts , according to reinhold robbe , the spd 's parliamentary defense committee speaker .
two opposition parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , joined the spd in supporting the conscript-based army .
" i 'm very much in favor of the draft , the draft links the soldiers to society it gives our army the ability to choose among good young people , " said cdu defense spokesman friedbert pflüger .
" i believe that being here in the center of europe we have to keep a strong standing force . "
however , the other half of german lawmakers , junior ruling coalition member , the greens , and the neo-liberal free democratic party , would like to see the conscript army done away with .
army 's role has changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of the bundeswehr has changed significantly since the end of the cold war opponents to the draft emphasize that a professional army is better suited to meet the requirements of an army whose tasks have dramatically changed in recent years .
following the collapse of communism and the disappearance of cold war enemies , the bundeswehr has been in a process of restructuring on a scale never seen before .
reductions in troop strength , sidelining national defense tasks and closure of military bases in germany are all part of the bundeswehr 's focus shifting to preparing specialist army units for future peace-enforcing or peace-keeping missions abroad .
" the defense of the country is no longer the main task of the defense forces in germany , " said jörg van essen , the fdp defense spokesman .
" we have crisis prevention abroad and you ca n't bring conscripts to foreign countries . "
parliamentary debate will continue defense minister struck has promised to have an independent panel of experts compare the benefits and drawbacks of draft-based and professional army systems .
but some parliamentary leaders have already made up their minds and want to enact a law that would do away with the conscription system by the end of this year .

while some in germany will hit the streets , demonstrators really want their voices to be heard during the president ’ s february visit . candlelight vigils , street protests and a mardi gras-like parade are some of the events that will bring out hundreds of people in germany to express their unhappiness with the american president at anti-inauguration activities around the country .
want to do something positive “ we felt there would be a lot of negative feelings coming up now if we didn ’ t do something positive , ” said ronald schlundt , chairman of the german chapter of democrats abroad , who will be attending an anti-inauguration parade in the village of ramstein .
democrats abroad will be holding counter-inaugural events in 24 countries around the world , schlundt added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were needed to keep protesters in check during bush 's last visit to germany in 2002 berlin ’ s brandenburg gate is the hub of two other events .
on wednesday night , the berlin district of democrats abroad held a candlelight vigil and on thursday , the day of the inauguration , vote x , an anti-bush group formed before the election , and other groups critical of the bush administration will demonstrate near the landmark with the slogan “ you ’ ve got a voice . ”
important to show discontent while the inauguration tends to be big news in the us , it doesn ’ t generally pull in a large foreign crowd .
indeed , it ’ s the president ’ s visit on february 23 that has really grabbed germans ’ attention .
bush has vowed to try to reach out to europe in an effort to smooth over differences opened by the iraq war during next month 's journey through belgium , germany , england and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during his february visit , bush , will meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder german protesters are hoping to make sure the president doesn ’ t have too easy of a time convincing europe ’ s politicians that the transatlantic rift has healed .
many of those critical of the united states feel they can not rely on the german government to express their indignation about bush ’ s policies .
“ it is important for people to show bush that the path he is on is wrong and very dangerous , we can not expect the government to do it for us , ” said peter strutynski of germany ’ s federal committee peace counsel .
“ they have been sending signals that they are willing to work with washington . ”
more reasons to fight on the way although they disagree with bush ’ s politics , attac , an anti-globalization group , is not planning any protests in connection with the inauguration , but it is one of many organizations planning to call for its members to take part in demonstrations when bush comes to germany , spokesperson malte kreutzfeldt said .
the groups are hoping for a large turnout at demonstrations next month as a way of showing the world that europe can act independently of american influence .
“ we can not give the impression that bush is right and that he will be able to get his partners behind him again , ” strutynski said .
“ we have to destroy the message that he will be able to win back his old nato allies . ”
keep bush out of berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration organizers will be hoping for a large turnout during bush 's visit to mainz demonstrators will have already notched up one success when bush comes to germany : ensuring that he is not received in the german capital . the president ’ s itinerary has him visiting the southern german city of mainz .
“ i think our demonstrations two years ago played a role in keeping bush out of berlin , ” strutynski said .
“ this time we want to show him that he is not welcome and that we do not want any part of his politics . ”
the groups agree that even though the democratic candidate john kerry lost last november ’ s election , they will continue to fight as the opposition party .
“ when i think about the election , i throw up my hands because we ’ re stuck with bush , ” democrats abroad member eva adams said .
“ but i ’ m not going to just roll over and take everything he wants to do . ” sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a new republican era ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.01.2005 muslims , activists lock horns on animal slaughter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a germany- based turkish butcher takes part in the celebration the festival of sacrifice is held by muslims around the world each year at the end of the haj .
but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.01.2005 fugitive pfahls comes home - to prison großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ex-politician will face trial on corruption and tax evasion charges former junior cabinet minister holger pfahls , one of germany ’ s most wanted men , was returned to the country thursday after being captured in france last year . prior to his arrest holger pfahls had spent five years on the run from german prosecutors , who want to put him on trial on charges of corruption and tax evasion . he has been held in custody in a french prison since he was arrested outside his home in paris on an international warrant last year . pfahls served as state secretary for defense under former chancellor helmut kohl from 1989 to 1992 .
the charges against him stem from a 1991 weapons deal .
he ’ s accused of accepting the equivalent of almost € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- from german-canadian businessman karlheinz schreiber to pushing through a deal to deliver 36 fuchs armored vehicles to saudi arabia . international itinerary pfahls is also suspected of tax evasion , for failing to declare the bribe to the german tax authorities as income .
for his part , former chancellor kohl has always denied that any bribes were involved in the armoured-vehicles deal . bildunterschrift : " most wanted " manhunt pictures put out by the german federal criminal police pfahls fled germany in 1999 , and investigators say over the next five years his flight from the german authorities took him to many cities around the world , including hong kong , jakarta , madrid and even montreal . but last july , his five years on the run came to an end .
the prosecutor in the southern-german city of augsburg , richard nemetz , confirmed pfahls ' arrest to reporters . at the time , nemetz told reporters : “ the accused , dr. pfahls , was arrested today outside of his home in paris .
he had been observed by the local police for some time .
when approached on the street , the suspect admitted that he was the dr. pfahls police were looking for . ” avoiding extradition , until now in the months following his arrest , pfahls sought to avoid being extradited to germany .
at a hearing in october , his lawyers had opposed extradition , arguing that the statute of limitations on the charges against him had lapsed under french law .
but a month later , a paris appeals court ruled that he could be extradited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfahls was arrested in front of his building on this paris street -lrb- avenue de suffren -rrb- pfahls then refrained from taking his case to a higher court , citing the “ untenable and unacceptable jail conditions in paris 's sante prison and his declining health . ”
pfahls is said to be suffering from high blood pressure . despite being in the so-called " vip wing " of paris ' maison d 'arrêt de la santé prison , pfahls deplored the conditions there , saying there were cockroaches in his cell and saying the food was " just slightly better than in congo . " at least there are no cockroaches occasionally , the one-time wunderkind who had reached the highest echelons of german political society needed to share his cell with french criminals whose hygiene , he said , left something to be desired . the french authorities extradited the 61-year-old ex-minister on thursday -lrb- jan .
20 -rrb- ; now in augsburg , he will be brought before a court within 24 hours . but officials say he is unlikely to be put on trial before the end of march .

the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .

he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .
the south squad beat the north , 110-103 .
what did cause a small stir was how the game began .
players on both squads refused to play in the first 48 seconds to send a message home to the league bosses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's basketball player of the year 2004 , does n't play in europe .
the german forward is a role model for youth but they are having troubles getting playing time in the bbl .
the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .

he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .
to put it simply , like european professional athletes . "

while some in germany will hit the streets , demonstrators really want their voices to be heard during the president ’ s february visit . candlelight vigils , street protests and a mardi gras-like parade are some of the events that will bring out hundreds of people in germany to express their unhappiness with the american president at anti-inauguration activities around the country .
want to do something positive “ we felt there would be a lot of negative feelings coming up now if we didn ’ t do something positive , ” said ronald schlundt , chairman of the german chapter of democrats abroad , who will be attending an anti-inauguration parade in the village of ramstein .
democrats abroad will be holding counter-inaugural events in 24 countries around the world , schlundt added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were needed to keep protesters in check during bush 's last visit to germany in 2002 berlin ’ s brandenburg gate is the hub of two other events .
on wednesday night , the berlin district of democrats abroad held a candlelight vigil and on thursday , the day of the inauguration , vote x , an anti-bush group formed before the election , and other groups critical of the bush administration will demonstrate near the landmark with the slogan “ you ’ ve got a voice . ”
important to show discontent while the inauguration tends to be big news in the us , it doesn ’ t generally pull in a large foreign crowd .
indeed , it ’ s the president ’ s visit on february 23 that has really grabbed germans ’ attention .
bush has vowed to try to reach out to europe in an effort to smooth over differences opened by the iraq war during next month 's journey through belgium , germany , england and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during his february visit , bush , will meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder german protesters are hoping to make sure the president doesn ’ t have too easy of a time convincing europe ’ s politicians that the transatlantic rift has healed .
many of those critical of the united states feel they can not rely on the german government to express their indignation about bush ’ s policies .
“ it is important for people to show bush that the path he is on is wrong and very dangerous , we can not expect the government to do it for us , ” said peter strutynski of germany ’ s federal committee peace counsel .
“ they have been sending signals that they are willing to work with washington . ”
more reasons to fight on the way although they disagree with bush ’ s politics , attac , an anti-globalization group , is not planning any protests in connection with the inauguration , but it is one of many organizations planning to call for its members to take part in demonstrations when bush comes to germany , spokesperson malte kreutzfeldt said .
the groups are hoping for a large turnout at demonstrations next month as a way of showing the world that europe can act independently of american influence .
“ we can not give the impression that bush is right and that he will be able to get his partners behind him again , ” strutynski said .
“ we have to destroy the message that he will be able to win back his old nato allies . ”
keep bush out of berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration organizers will be hoping for a large turnout during bush 's visit to mainz demonstrators will have already notched up one success when bush comes to germany : ensuring that he is not received in the german capital . the president ’ s itinerary has him visiting the southern german city of mainz .
“ i think our demonstrations two years ago played a role in keeping bush out of berlin , ” strutynski said .
“ this time we want to show him that he is not welcome and that we do not want any part of his politics . ”
the groups agree that even though the democratic candidate john kerry lost last november ’ s election , they will continue to fight as the opposition party .
“ when i think about the election , i throw up my hands because we ’ re stuck with bush , ” democrats abroad member eva adams said .
“ but i ’ m not going to just roll over and take everything he wants to do . ” sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a new republican era ?

but what is one of the muslim world 's most joyous periods , is an annual thorn in the side of german animal right activists . under islam , the end of hajj is marked by eid ul adha , or the festival of sacrifice , which falls today -lrb- thursday , jan .
20 -rrb- . it is one of the most important holidays on the islamic calendar , and is celebrated by all muslims around the world - not only those who are on a pilgrimage to mecca .
and every year just before the holy day , the german animal rights association appeals to muslims to stun their sacrificial animals with electric shocks before they slaughter them . religious duty , religious right ? for many muslims , this would be unacceptable .
they see sacrificing an animal that is fully conscious as a religious duty and one which they have the right to fulfill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years ago , germany 's constitutional court ruled in favor of the ritual slaughter here in germany , they do indeed have that right .
the country 's most senior court ruled three years ago that muslims are allowed to slaughter animals without stunning them if this is dictated by their religious beliefs .
but there are more restrictions on the practice in germany than in muslim countries .
slaughter without stunning can only be carried out with a special permit issued by a local authority . such permits are not issued by religious experts , but by official veterinary departments .
the chairman of germany 's islamic council , ali kizilkaya , finds this practice dubious . veterinarians decide " it is then more or less left to the discretion of the official veterinary department , whether the person who wants to do the slaughter can give a sufficient religious justification , " kizilkaya said .
" but it can not and should not be the job of the official veterinary department to decide whether or not someone is devout enough . " but thomas schröder , head of germany 's animal rights association , said veterinary offices simply have to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed . " it would certainly be too much for the veterinary office to have to make decisions about religious customs .
the veterinary office looks at the law ; that is their goal .
and i must stress that the law says : no animal should be subject to suffering and pain without a reasonable cause , " schröder said .
" muslims then say , ' freedom of religion is a reasonable cause , and we invoke the constitution . " change in the law the law , however , has become more complicated recently . the constitutional court ruling on halal slaughter was followed a few months later in may 2002 by a parliamentary resolution in which animal protection was enshrined in germany 's basic law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims during ritual slaughter schröder said this meant that religious freedom as a constitutional right no longer enjoys priority over animal protection .
a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

a balance now has to be struck between animal protection and religious ritual , he said . " in this light , halal slaughter needs to be looked at anew , " schröder said . he also pointed out that several muslim leaders in germany have no objection to stunning the animals prior to sacrifice .
the topic is hotly debated , and there is more than one point of view . a question of discrimination ? " germany has many different muslim groups .
and within individual groups , there is certainly discord on the topic .
for us animal-rights activists , it is clear : if an animal is stunned , then it still fulfills the criteria of animal sacrifice according to the koran , " schröder said . for his part , the islamic council 's kizilkaya counters that it is not the job of animal rights campaigners to decide on islamic religious issues . some muslims in germany also feel they are discriminated against , because the country 's small jewish community is exempt from any ban on sacrificial animal slaughter . kizilkaya noted that jewish groups are themselves not happy with this lack of equality , and that muslims wanting to sacrifice animals without stunning them beforehand can count on the support of jewish representatives . mark caldwell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one for the animals after years of debate , germany 's parliament voted friday to become the first in europe to include protection of animals in its constitution .

the stadiums to the bundesliga will be opening their gates again to start the second leg of the season .
in the winter break , teams were wheeling and dealing to improve their position .
now they will see if it pays off . the first match of the second leg on friday evening begins with a classic north-south rivalry - bayern munich vs. hamburg .
bayern do not give up many points at home against hsv .
in fact , it has been 23 years since hamburg have won in the bavarian capital .
but hamburg is flying high under new coach thomas doll , who took over for the deposed klaus toppmöller last fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's michael ballack will watch from the bench .
he 's serving a one-game suspension in friday 's match former munich midfielder david jarolim believes hamburg can rewrite history .
the team 's chances increase with bayern 's midfield leader michael ballack on the sidelines serving a one game suspension .
the home crowd at munich 's olympic stadium will also welcome back an old face .
bixente lizarazu , who left the team after last season to play out his career in his native france , returned to munich after a disappointing stint at olympique marseille .
schalke , bremen clash on the field , the most attractive game on saturday is definitely schalke vs. bremen .
off the field , bremen have frequently been in the headlines during the winter break .
the high point was a fight between fabian ernst and french midfielder johan micoud .
ernst came away with eight stitches over his eye .
thomas schaaf 's midfielders have apparently settled the matter , but not before ernst considered leaving the club , according to the kicker sports magazine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke -lrb- in blue -rrb- had the upper hand in the first-leg contest , winning 1-0 schalks 's excitement has been limited to the front office , where manager rudi assauer has been engaged in a war of words with bayern manager uli hoeneß .
ralf rangnick 's crew is even on points -lrb- 34 -rrb- with bayern munich and looking to distance themselves from the defending champions bremen who stand six points back .
third place side stuttgart travel to mainz .
the biggest news out of stuttgart is that international goalkeeper timo hildebrand will not return to the club after this season .
mainz played exciting football throughout much of the first leg before running out of energy towards the end .
they are strong at home and coach hopes to give a good start to his second leg goal of staying in the top league .
gladbach busy in winter borussia mönchengladbach were one of the busiest teams in the break .
coach dick advokaat has been given practically carte blanche in reshaping the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's players , here marcelo pletsch , have an uncertain future under coach dick advokaat he brought in five new faces , including former belgian league scoring champion wesley sonck from ajax amsterdam and schalke ’ s unhappy midfielder jörg böhme .
15th place gladbach hosts arminia bielefeld .
last place freiburg used the five week break to fetch another three players and true to its international character , freiburg and coach volker finke brought in three non-germans .
two of them are meant to shore up freiburg ’ s suspect defense .
the final man is dutch striker samuel koejoe who should help an equally suspect offense , which found the net only 14 times in 17 first leg matches .
to start the second leg freiburg travels to 17th place rostock .
rostock failed to win a single home match in the first leg and freiburg is particularly weak on the road .

from basketball to soccer , there are quotas .
now a russian soccer player in spain wants to change that - and looks to have a good chance . the german all-star basketball game did not attract a lot of attention in the german media .

he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .

the hoopsters want more say in affairs in the league .
one matter they are particularly concerned about is the number of foreign , specifically non-eu , players in the league .
before the current season , the german basketball league -lrb- bbl -rrb- made a decision to drop quotas for players who come from countries that have labor agreements with the eu .
germany 's national coach , dirk bauermann , called the decision fatal for the younger players who will now have less opportunity to play since foreign players are frequently better and cheaper .
the bbl , however , may have smelled the winds of change within the eu .
russian player in spain felt discriminated against the matter came to a head this month when the eu 's head lawyer posted an opinion in favor of the non-eu athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sc freiburg have thrived on non-eu players igor simutenkov , a soccer player for spanish side deportivo tenerife , was subjected to a quota in the primera division that limits the number of non-eu players a team can field .
he felt this was discriminatory and after some investigation , his agent found out that indeed simutenkov 's right to work freely within the eu had indeed been violated .
his argument was based on a partnership agreement between russia and the eu .
the eu 's advocate-general , christine stix-hackl , said the agreement prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality with regards to working conditions .
the case must still be heard by the european court of justice , but opinions of the advocate-general are usually followed by the court in future rulings .
more opportunities also for non-europeans should the ecj concur with stix-hackl 's opinion , almost all barriers for athletes from outside the eu , even beyond europe 's borders , would have to be dropped .
sports rights expert professor peter tettinger believes there is little possibility that quotas and other restrictions can stand up to such a decision .
" once the -lrb- non-eu -rrb- athlete is active in an eu country , then the agreement between the eu and the partnership country apply .
then he has to be treated the same as every other employee .
to put it simply , like european professional athletes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges will have the last word on player quotas in the eu not just athletes from eastern european countries such russia , belarus or ukraine would benefit .
sportsmen and women from many african countries , the caribbean , and the pacific rim could play without restriction in any european sports league .
the foundation is the cotonou agreement from june 2000 .
the german sports association -lrb- dsv -rrb- is not thrilled about such prospects .
dsv vice-president christa thiel says that the quotas were implemented to give younger german athletes the opportunity to play .
others say that the influx of players from abroad , assuming they are top-notch , only help to strengthen german athletes . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

dr rowan williams warned in the times that a change could lead to elderly or terminally ill people being talked into dying for convenience .
his comments come after retired policeman brian blackburn was spared jail when he killed his terminally ill wife and tried to take his own life .
mr blackburn was given a suspended nine-month sentence at the old bailey .
' avoidable pain ' dr williams said that the recognition of a legal right to assisted dying could entail a responsibility on others to kill .
" the appeal to our sense of compassion in order to justify a change in our legal practice is wholly understandable ; but could it end up undermining just that broad sense of unconditional human worth and value in which compassion itself is grounded ? " he said .
" the right to be spared avoidable pain is beyond debate - as is the right to say yes or no to certain treatments in the knowledge of factors such as these .
" but once that has mutated into a right to expect assistance in dying , the responsibility of others is involved , as is the whole question of what society is saying about life and its possible meanings .
legislation ignores these at its cost . "
brian blackburn admitted killing his terminally ill wife in a suicide pact mr blackburn and his 62-year-old wife margaret , who was dying of stomach cancer , entered a suicide pact which went wrong when he failed to die after cutting his own wrists .
a post-mortem examination on mrs blackburn had shown she had a 3kg -lrb- about 6lbs 8oz -rrb- tumour in her stomach .
mr blackburn received a nine-month jail sentence which was suspended for two years at the old bailey .
voluntary euthanasia society spokesman mark slattery said that dr williams was out of touch with many christians .
" the majority of worshippers think it is a matter of compassion that when someone faces death , the issue of how they die is a very important one , " he said .
" when facing death you do not have a choice between life or death .
the choice is sometimes only whether you die well or badly . "

an incinerator which would deal with waste from across east sussex has been proposed for newhaven , 15 miles away .
local residents have fought a long battle against the scheme and it has also been criticised by environmental groups including friends of the earth .
although the proposed plant is outside brighton and hove it affects the city as its waste would be dealt with there .
recycling targets many newhaven residents are against the scheme as they feel it would affect the environment and their health .
no planning application has been put forward for the plant , but a public inquiry last year into east sussex county council 's waste plan ended with newhaven being recommended as a suitable site .
another proposed site , mountfield , near battle , was ruled out at the same time .
friends of the earth has criticised the county council 's plans , claiming the recycling targets are too low .

the national trust has applied to turn the greve de lecq barracks into apartments for tourists .
it would like to see the old barracks acting as a gateway to the north of the island and incorporated into guides to coastal walks .
one room would be recreated as the original barracks and an educational film about the area would be shown .
the barracks were built at the time of the napoleonic wars and the trust 's chief executive , charles allutto , says the whole site needs about £ 300,000 investment .
a tourism grant has been offered , but it will not cover all the work and the trust is looking at other options .
by turning the barracks into self-catering apartments without altering their exterior , mr allutto hopes visitors will see the area 's beauty which he says is one of the least explored of the island .

mary niersmans , 81 , and peggy cotter , 80 , both died after ' unacceptable care ' at cardiff 's whitchurch hospital .
mrs niersmans suffered two broken legs which were undiagnosed for four days .
an official report , leaked to the bbc , had queried patient safety just months before the deaths .
the hospital said all its improvements would take time .
the march 2004 report had revealed that staff felt lessons had not been learnt from earlier serious incidents involving elderly mentally ill patients .
it prompted cardiff and vale nhs trust to launch an action plan .
if they had used a hoist , she would still be alive today irene nelmes , daughter but the bbc has discovered that just months after the report was published , mrs niersmans , from llanishen in cardiff , suffered two broken legs after being taken to the toilet by two male care assistants .
despite complaining of pain , and a doctor recommending she should be x-rayed , whitchurch hospital staff did not send her for diagnosis for four days .
by then she had developed breathing difficulties .
she died at the university hospital of wales two weeks later .
her family complained to the hospital that staff had failed to use a hoist to lift mrs niersmans , who had been unable to walk for six years .
peggy cotter suffered ' aggressive behaviour ' from some staff " if they had used a hoist , she would still be alive today , " said her daughter , irene nelmes .
an external investigation concluded there had been " serious errors " .
the hospital trust told the bbc it could not comment on individual cases .
within months of mrs niersmans ' death , whitchurch hospital was again admitting failures in its care on the same ward for elderly mentally ill patients .
the family of peggy cotter from rumney in cardiff complained to the hospital after she was admitted in october 2004 .
they felt staff neglected her after they had complained about care standards and said there was a dramatic deterioration in her condition which hastened her death at the hospital in november .
' a general impression of ineptitude ' her son allan said : " we complained about it -lrb- her treatment -rrb- and it was n't liked .
my biggest regret is leaving her in that hospital . "
a hospital investigation agreed with many of the family 's complaints , although it said mrs cotter 's cancer , which was undiagnosed at the time , would also have contributed to her decline .
among the hospital 's findings were : nursing care below an acceptable standard , and evidence of neglect .
a lack of management ... which led to poor communication , disorganised working practices and a general impression of ineptitude .
inappropriate and aggressive behaviour by staff towards mrs cotter and her family .
the hospital told the family how it had brought in improvements as a result of the investigation , including disciplinary procedures , appointing a new ward manager and extra staff training .
in a statement to the bbc , the trust said the care and treatment of patients was its number one priority and the findings of the march 2004 report were being acted on .
it added : " whilst the trust is taking action as quickly as is possible , within the resources at its disposal , the full implementation of all the action plan 's aims will only be achieved over time " .
the assembly government said it was monitoring progress of the trust 's action plan , and could not comment on indvidual cases .

david russell , 84 , will travel to a mine in ikuno in march , where he hopes to be reunited with a japanese miner who cared for him when he was injured .
the holywood man will make the trip thanks to £ 2,100 from the big lottery fund 's heroes return programme .
he is one of seven northern ireland veterans receiving such grants .
a round of grants announced on thursday , totalling £ 6,155 , is allowing veterans , wives and carers to make pilgrimages to ww2 battlefields across the world .
mr russell served as an air gunner and wireless operator in the raf during the war .
he was captured in java and sent to japan where he worked in horrendous conditions in a copper mine for three and a half years .
this miner who was my boss was the only one to show me kindness .
david russell he said : " i was captured while trying to get to australia in a lifeboat with seven other men .
we capsized near the coast of bali and were handed over to the japanese .
" all the time they promised to kill us - it was a pretty horrible experience .
physical punishment was the order of the day .
" the worst thing was the hunger - we were all starving and looked like scarecrows .
but our camp was the most civilised society i have ever lived in because all rank and class had disappeared .
" we supported and looked out for each other and we never stopped hoping . "
mr russell is returning to japan with his daughter and granddaughter and hopes to be re-united with one man - a miner who helped him when he lost the end of his finger .
" this miner , who was my boss , was the only one to show me kindness .
he sent me back to camp and did my work until i was better .
" at the end of the war the americans dropped parcels of food and clothing in the camp .
' great sacrifices ' " i made up a box for the man and his family because they were starving and took it to his shack before i left on the train .
he was n't there so i left it with his wife and children .
" but as the train pulled away he came running up the platform with tears streaming down his face shouting ' thank you ' .
that was the last time i saw him . "
breidge gadd , one of the big lottery fund 's northern ireland board members , said the heroes return scheme had been very popular in the province .
" it recognises the great sacrifices made by veterans and we believe it is important that those who served in the war and their surviving spouses should be able to make a visit to places of great significance to them , " she said .
applications for awards under the heroes return scheme must be submitted by 31 march .

accountants , bankers , scientists and sales executives were among those looking for a change , england 's teacher training agency found .
they made the move despite some facing a drop in income to £ 18,558 a year .
the tta survey , of 571 newly qualified staff , found eight out of 10 were keen for an " intellectual challenge " .
' creative classrooms ' some 78 % gave this as a reason for changing career .
meanwhile , 89 % cited working with young people - the focus of the tta 's recent £ 12m advertising campaign , featuring the slogan " use your head : teach " .
nearly a quarter of teachers in maths who had changed jobs had worked in banking or accountancy .
one in six science teachers had been scientists , while 15 % of new language teachers had worked in sales before altering careers .
mike watkins , the tta 's recruitment director , said teaching offered a range of new experiences compared with other professions . "
it 's positive for the pupils to know i 've given up what they consider a glamorous career to work in a school " former tv presenter suzanne hills " classrooms are very creative places and interacting with young people on a daily basis means that the job is constantly stimulating and intellectually challenging , " he said .
suzanne hills , 29 , changed career from tv presenting to teaching science at cheney school , oxford .
having previously studied zoology , biology and geology at swansea university , she feels her accumulated skills serve her well in the classroom .
ms hills told bbc news : " most of my job is about getting the point across .
in tv the audience was passive , whereas here it 's active , and you have to keep its attention .
" it 's positive for the pupils to know i 've given up what they consider a glamorous career to work in a school .

the £ 200m ship left southampton port on wednesday night to undergo final tests .
a p & o spokeswoman confirmed that the checks had proved to be " satisfactory so far " and that the liner was heading for madeira , its first port of call .
aurora was to depart for its world trip on 9 january but had , until wednesday , been no further than the isle of wight .
the delays have resulted in 385 of the 1,752 passengers leaving the ship .
those who remain , some of whom have paid up to £ 42,000 for the trip , were treated to free drinks and entertainment while the ship was stuck in port .
the cruise 's itinerary has been revised as a result of the delays , with 16 of the 40 planned ports of call missed out , including acapulco , barbados , honolulu and san francisco .
the ship will also return home via the suez canal and not the panama canal .
p & o have said passengers will be compensated for the loss of days and those on the first leg of the cruise were offered a full refund if they did not want to go .
the german-built ship , launched in 2000 , has suffered bad luck since it was named by the princess royal and the champagne bottle did not smash , which is considered a bad omen .
