germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.01.2005 jews in germany feel winds of change 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of jews means new synagogues have been opened as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry . anti-semitism in europe and the strengthening of the inter-religious dialogue were at the forefront of the two-day meeting of the world jewish congress .
but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
during a speech in wuppertal , germany , spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- said many jews in germany are feeling insecure .
he cited greater success of the radical right-wing npd and dvu parties , increased attacks on jewish cemeteries , and worrisome comments by public officials such the catholic archbishop joachim meisner , who recently compared abortion to the holocaust . influx from the east another issue creating a stir in german political circles is jewish immigration .
berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .
it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
during a speech in wuppertal , germany , spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- said many jews in germany are feeling insecure .
he cited greater success of the radical right-wing npd and dvu parties , increased attacks on jewish cemeteries , and worrisome comments by public officials such the catholic archbishop joachim meisner , who recently compared abortion to the holocaust . influx from the east another issue creating a stir in german political circles is jewish immigration .
berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .
it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .
the new rules are " ready for discussion in some areas , and in others fully unacceptable , " spiegel said .
" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said . ' fraud should be stopped ' michael lawton , who founded the gescher lamassoret liberal synagogue in cologne , noted that there is " general agreement , even in jewish community , that there is fraud in the application process , and that this fraud should be stopped . " the difficulty , though , is " coming to an agreement on who should be allowed in . " making applicants prove that they are currently involved in a jewish community in the cis presents a double standard , lawton explained .
many non-practicing jews were killed in the holocaust , when the standard of proof was simply whether one had jewish forebears .
" if the idea is to provide restitution for the holocaust or protect people from anti-semitism , then the same standard that applied during the holocaust should apply today , " he noted .
meanwhile , israel has spent the last decade urging the former soviet jews to apply for residency in the jewish state rather than germany .
a future for jews in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david denysenko participates in the ceremony marking the anniversary of the nationwide nazi pogrom of 1938 , in the synagogue in the city of regensburg .
david gall , who until recently published hagalil , an internet newspaper aimed at combating anti-semitism , agrees with the israelis .
eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .
the history of jews in germany should come to an end . "
on the outside , gall said , germany appears to have become open to judaism , with the government funding various initiatives to fight anti-semitism .
but for the most part , these are ineffective and empty , he said .
" this country does n't really want jews here .
there are signs of that everywhere , " he said bluntly .
but his personal opinion aside , gall says he understands why immigrants are choosing germany over israel .
" first of all , it is similar – the weather , the food , the culture .
look at a picture of st. petersburg and berlin , they 're not so different .
on the other hand , tel aviv is completely different .
also , the financial situation is more upbeat in germany , " he said .
finally , gall said , " there 's the question of security – in israel there are bombs going off in supermarkets .
that does n't really sound so appealing to people .

all five organisations are active in asia , africa and latin america . beyond immediate need a spokesperson for the new alliance said that while poor people are most vulnerable to the effects of a disaster such as the tsunami , assisting these people in a long-term effort could limit the consequences of a catastrophe in the future .
martin bröckelmann , head of misereor , said governments should also strive to eradicate the causes of extreme poverty and hunger in these regions when giving aid now . " in regions where wars are being waged and regimes rule that don ’ t care about the poor , the affects of the tsunami floods have been much more disastrous , " bröckelmann said .
" the poor are those who suffer most , and after catastrophes such as this , the lack of justice and equality in society becomes more apparent . " the new alliance is designed to merge the five organizations ' short-term disaster relief with long-term development aid . appeal to industrialized nations " we are an alliance of development aid organizations that all focus primarily on international justice and an end to poverty and exploitation , " said peter mucke , chief executive of terre des homes .
" the donations we receive are being spent on long-term projects in the first place , which means our support exists long before a disaster happens and continues long after it is no longer in the international spotlight . " the alliance 's representatives also urged industrialized nations not to forget their pledge made to the united nations to earmark 0.7 percent of their gdp to international development .
despite the generosity being shown by the german government and public in terms of donations for the tsunami victims , the alliance criticized the fact that germany is behind on its development promise , with just 0.28 percent of gdp currently being spent on aid . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rejects sending jobless to tsunami areas chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid .

berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .
it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

8 1815 to feb .
9 , 1905 -rrb- is known as the most important german painter and artist of the 19th century .
on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his death , an exhibition called " menzel and der hof " opens at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie on the museum 's island . showcasing gouache drawings , graphics and documents , the show will be the forerunner to another exhibition at the kulturforum at berlin 's potsdamer platz called " menzel and berlin - a homage " which opens on march 11 , 2005 and runs through june 5 , 2005 .
fittingly , the exhibition venue is a stone 's throw from the artist 's former studio in berlin . a true berliner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolph von menzel menzel spent 75 years of his life in berlin and enjoyed a close affinity to the city and its surroundings like no other artist .
though he was born in breslau -lrb- in current day poland -rrb- like many berliners of the time and only migrated with his family to berlin when he was 16 , menzel came to epitomize the quintessential berliner . he was made an honorary citizen of the city in his old age and was even knighted shortly after that .
after his death on feb .
9 , 1905 , menzel became the first and only artist of prussia to be honored with a state funeral at the graveyard in berlin 's bergmannstrasse . his family grave is still there today as are those of architect martin gropius -lrb- 1824-1880 -rrb- , poet ludwig tieck -lrb- 1773-1853 -rrb- , historian theodor mommsen -lrb- 1817-1903 -rrb- and the philosopher friedrich scheiermacher -lrb- 1768-1834 -rrb- . prophet of the modern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting by francisco josé de goya one of the undisputed highlights of berlin 's art calendar in 2005 is a large exhibition on spanish master francisco de goya .
called " goya - the prophet of the modern " , the show will be at the alte nationalgalerie from july 12 until sept .
28 . goya -lrb- 1746-1828 -rrb- was an extraordinarily versatile artist .
he was a brilliant painter of portraits and could at the same time forcefully present the horrors of war and suffering .
his famous oil paintings include " the naked maya " and " the shooting of street fighters by the french " . end of the war in germany berlin 's german historical museum and the museum of european cultures in dahlem are dedicating special exhibitions to the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 , 1945 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soviet soldier places his nation 's flag over the reichstag , the german parliament building in berlin on april 30 , 1945 , after the germans surrendered , ending world war ii .
another show called " the war and its repercussions " at the zeughaus unter den linden also dwells on the topic through accounts by contemporary witnesses , excerpts from dairies and 400 other documents and artworks .
at the german-russian museum in karlshorst , where the german capitulation treaty was signed , a special exhibition will remember the war from a soviet perspective . nefertiti 's wandering bust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile berlin 's museum island is preparing for the move of the famous limestone bust of egyptian queen nefertiti from the egyptian museum near the charlottenburg palace to an exhibition at the kulturforum on the potsdamer platz .

the un is asking for concrete agreements , with deadlines attached . donor nations must speed up delivery of aid pledges for the asian tsunami relief effort and face public shame if they fail to live up to their promises , a top un official told a key conference in geneva on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami victim waits in line for food from unhcr aid in sri lanka jan egeland , the un emergency relief coordinator , said that of $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.6 billion -rrb- of formal aid pledges , only $ 300 million had been committed so far to projects , programs and assistance on the ground . " we need very quickly more signed contracts , more cash , more concrete commitments to help keep this massive effort going in the next six months , " he told reporters just before the geneva conference got underway . he said he expected it to produce a " large part " of the un appeal launched last week for $ 977 million for the next six months , and the rest would follow " soon . " un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped that the countries represented at the conference would collect a further billion dollars .
and in addition to mourning the dead , the world should now think of helping the living . " we must look forward , " annan said .
taking care of children in desperate situations is the first priority of the un programs , he added . but egeland warned that if remaining pledges were not also turned into reality , victims of the dec .
26 killer waves , which left more than 157,000 people dead , would feel short-changed . " they will not forget and we should not forget , " he said . nevertheless , he added , the deadly outbreak of disease and starvation that officials had initially feared in the aftermath of the disaster did not appear to have materialized . ' humanity at its best ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami surviver asks for food from a us airforce soldier in aceh province , indonesia the conference under un auspices brought together representatives of more than 80 countries and organizations , as well as aid agencies and the stricken nations , to firm up promises and ensure better coordination of how , when and where aid is delivered . so far more than $ 8 billion has been pledged in an unprecedented worldwide display of government and public sympathy - " humanity at its very best , " egeland said . at the same time , he insisted other crises , notably in africa , must not be neglected . " it would be the ultimate disappointment for us and tragedy for the victims in all those other areas , where we are struggling to keep programs going on existing levels of assistance , were they to suffer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers load boxes of aid bound for banda aceh aid officials fear that as memories of the tsunami disaster fade , the amount actually delivered will diminish . the british charity oxfam said it was " crunch time " for the international community to ensure promises are kept . " we want guarantees that it 's new money , that it 's not money that is being diverted from another disaster or existing aid budget , " such as for sudan , a spokeswoman said . egeland said it was also a commitment he was seeking , noting that at times of disaster , " there 's a disproportion between generous pledges and the actual money delivered . " public scrutiny the un is to use a financial tracking system , consultable via the internet , to keep tabs on pledges from the moment they are made to when they are finally realized on the ground . " it will make the donors actually accountable for honoring their pledges , " egeland went on , with public scrutiny making it " very hard " for donors not to follow up . aid officials are keenly aware the donor community has often failed to live up to past promises . last year , governments found only 63 percent of the $ 3.4 million the un had asked for .
after the december 2003 quake that levelled the iranian city of bam , the un asked for $ 333 million for immediate relief .
a year later , only $ 17 million had come through . the tracing system is being set up with us auditors pricewaterhousecoopers , who will also monitor how aid is delivered to make sure there is no misuse of funds . the offer by the us company , which un officials say is free of charge , came after scathing criticism of the way the un ran its controversial iraqi oil-for-food program under the regime of former leader saddam hussein . egeland promised an immediate investigation into any claims of mishandling aid money . bildunterschrift : survivor in sri lanka before the tsunami relief meeting , egeland appealed for more cash toward an appeal launched in november for 14 other needy regions , ranging from the democratic republic of congo to chechnya and the palestinian territories . while it was relatively easy getting international aid for iraq and kosovo , it was a " nightmare " trying to meet africa 's needs , he said , although there were up to 30 million people in desperate need of assistance . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

all five organisations are active in asia , africa and latin america . beyond immediate need a spokesperson for the new alliance said that while poor people are most vulnerable to the effects of a disaster such as the tsunami , assisting these people in a long-term effort could limit the consequences of a catastrophe in the future .
martin bröckelmann , head of misereor , said governments should also strive to eradicate the causes of extreme poverty and hunger in these regions when giving aid now . " in regions where wars are being waged and regimes rule that don ’ t care about the poor , the affects of the tsunami floods have been much more disastrous , " bröckelmann said .
" the poor are those who suffer most , and after catastrophes such as this , the lack of justice and equality in society becomes more apparent . " the new alliance is designed to merge the five organizations ' short-term disaster relief with long-term development aid . appeal to industrialized nations " we are an alliance of development aid organizations that all focus primarily on international justice and an end to poverty and exploitation , " said peter mucke , chief executive of terre des homes .
" the donations we receive are being spent on long-term projects in the first place , which means our support exists long before a disaster happens and continues long after it is no longer in the international spotlight . " the alliance 's representatives also urged industrialized nations not to forget their pledge made to the united nations to earmark 0.7 percent of their gdp to international development .
despite the generosity being shown by the german government and public in terms of donations for the tsunami victims , the alliance criticized the fact that germany is behind on its development promise , with just 0.28 percent of gdp currently being spent on aid . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rejects sending jobless to tsunami areas chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid .

the un is asking for concrete agreements , with deadlines attached . donor nations must speed up delivery of aid pledges for the asian tsunami relief effort and face public shame if they fail to live up to their promises , a top un official told a key conference in geneva on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami victim waits in line for food from unhcr aid in sri lanka jan egeland , the un emergency relief coordinator , said that of $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.6 billion -rrb- of formal aid pledges , only $ 300 million had been committed so far to projects , programs and assistance on the ground . " we need very quickly more signed contracts , more cash , more concrete commitments to help keep this massive effort going in the next six months , " he told reporters just before the geneva conference got underway . he said he expected it to produce a " large part " of the un appeal launched last week for $ 977 million for the next six months , and the rest would follow " soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.01.2005 right wing solidarity plan called illegal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right wing nationalists hope to win more votes by joining forces experts have determined that an intended alliance between two german extreme-right political parties is likely illegal .
the npd and dvu had planned on a joint ticket for the 2006 national election . after reviewing a plan by the far-right nationalist npd and dvu parties to join forces on a common ticket and thereby garner more votes in the upcoming parliamentary election , a bundestag committee decided that " multiple-party polling lists are not allowed under the german voting law . " in october , chairmen for the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- put aside decades of rivalry and approved the plan for a joint voting list in 2006 . udo voigt -lrb- npd -rrb- and gerhard frey -lrb- dvu -rrb- apparently hoped that by joining forces rather than standing against one another , they could garner the 5 percent of votes needed to win a seat in the lower house of parliament .
they planned to sign the pact at an npd party congress this week . the nine-page official ruling is not legally binding , but it is a " helpful component in the political argument , " according to social democrat parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who called for the official examination of the situation .

germany plays a role in their latest work in new york too , this time weaving and stitching their trademark fabric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrapped reichstag building in berlin a decade ago , christo and jeanne-claude created a sensation when they swaddled the german reichstag or parliament building in shimmering silver fabric for two weeks in a statement of berlin 's cold war east-west political divide . as the artist duo prepare for their latest art installation in new york - setting up 7,500 gates hung with panels of saffron-colored fabric in central park - germany is once again involved .
few know that much of the handiwork for " the gates , " as the new york art installation is called , was done across the atlantic in small workshops in sleepy german towns . and , as if in a continuing vein of the artists ' reichstag project , germany 's once divided halves are in it together : a manufacturing company in taucha near leipzig in eastern germany and a weaving mill in the town of emsdette , near münster in western germany , have labored separately to ensure that " the gates " opens as scheduled on feb .
12 . special commission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. artists christo , right , and jeanne-claude both companies have worked for the bulgarian-born christo and his french wife and co-artist jeanne-claude before . there 's little doubt that the high-profile new york project is a further feather in their cap . klaus schirmer , head of production at the schilden company , which wove the sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow for " the gates , " said it was n't a routine commission .

few know that much of the handiwork for " the gates , " as the new york art installation is called , was done across the atlantic in small workshops in sleepy german towns . and , as if in a continuing vein of the artists ' reichstag project , germany 's once divided halves are in it together : a manufacturing company in taucha near leipzig in eastern germany and a weaving mill in the town of emsdette , near münster in western germany , have labored separately to ensure that " the gates " opens as scheduled on feb .
12 . special commission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. artists christo , right , and jeanne-claude both companies have worked for the bulgarian-born christo and his french wife and co-artist jeanne-claude before . there 's little doubt that the high-profile new york project is a further feather in their cap . klaus schirmer , head of production at the schilden company , which wove the sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow for " the gates , " said it was n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us , " schirmer told deutsche welle during the manufacturing stage last year . christo reportedly paid the weaving mill around € 400,000 -lrb- $ 524,000 -rrb- for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company . prestige for the tiny sewing workshop in taucha , which belonged to the communist east german government and has now been bought over by the swiss bieri group , the christo commission brought welcome relief to its workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bieri zeltaplan gmbh in taucha sews for christo 's " the gates " " it 's a nice change , " susann reihe , who has been stitching together the fabric panels for christo and jeanne-claude 's new york artwork for the past year in taucha , told german broadcaster wdr .
" we normally do protective weather-proof covers for cars , party-tents and the like , that demands a whole lot of painstaking work , " reihe said .
" this is really lovely in contrast . " christo 's project manager wolfgang volz said that the taucha-based bieri zeltaplan company had already proven its skills and quality during the reichstag wrapping project .
" at the time we had a really good experience with them , " volz told wdr .
" that 's why we approached them again . " roland eilenberger , head of bieri zeltaplan is clear that the commission has also brought the company much prestige in their line of work . " naturally , you ca n't market such a project in the same way that you would perhaps bring out a luxurious product on the market , " eilenberger said .
" but , overall , in the textile industry it 's pretty unique to able to work and complete such a mammoth project . " the company shipped off the last of the fabric panels to new york last november . gigantic artworks " the gates " is just the latest in a string of gigantic public art pieces that the conceptual artists are known for , most of which have involved wrapping swathes of fabric around massive objects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus , the wrapping of the reichstag and opening 3,100 umbrellas in japan and california . " the gates , " which like most of the artist duo 's works is monumental but temporary , will consist of five-meter-high gates placed at intervals of about 3.5 meters along 37 kilometers of footpaths throughout new york 's central park .
the saffron-colored fabric panels will be suspended from each gate , falling to two meters above the ground . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks . as with most of christo and jeanne-claude 's projects , the fabric is central to the installation .
this time the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de weaving for art 's sake artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .

berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .

but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
during a speech in wuppertal , germany , spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- said many jews in germany are feeling insecure .
he cited greater success of the radical right-wing npd and dvu parties , increased attacks on jewish cemeteries , and worrisome comments by public officials such the catholic archbishop joachim meisner , who recently compared abortion to the holocaust . influx from the east another issue creating a stir in german political circles is jewish immigration .
berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .
it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

the npd and dvu had planned on a joint ticket for the 2006 national election . after reviewing a plan by the far-right nationalist npd and dvu parties to join forces on a common ticket and thereby garner more votes in the upcoming parliamentary election , a bundestag committee decided that " multiple-party polling lists are not allowed under the german voting law . " in october , chairmen for the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- put aside decades of rivalry and approved the plan for a joint voting list in 2006 . udo voigt -lrb- npd -rrb- and gerhard frey -lrb- dvu -rrb- apparently hoped that by joining forces rather than standing against one another , they could garner the 5 percent of votes needed to win a seat in the lower house of parliament .
they planned to sign the pact at an npd party congress this week . the nine-page official ruling is not legally binding , but it is a " helpful component in the political argument , " according to social democrat parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who called for the official examination of the situation .

germany plays a role in their latest work in new york too , this time weaving and stitching their trademark fabric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrapped reichstag building in berlin a decade ago , christo and jeanne-claude created a sensation when they swaddled the german reichstag or parliament building in shimmering silver fabric for two weeks in a statement of berlin 's cold war east-west political divide . as the artist duo prepare for their latest art installation in new york - setting up 7,500 gates hung with panels of saffron-colored fabric in central park - germany is once again involved .
few know that much of the handiwork for " the gates , " as the new york art installation is called , was done across the atlantic in small workshops in sleepy german towns . and , as if in a continuing vein of the artists ' reichstag project , germany 's once divided halves are in it together : a manufacturing company in taucha near leipzig in eastern germany and a weaving mill in the town of emsdette , near münster in western germany , have labored separately to ensure that " the gates " opens as scheduled on feb .
12 . special commission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. artists christo , right , and jeanne-claude both companies have worked for the bulgarian-born christo and his french wife and co-artist jeanne-claude before . there 's little doubt that the high-profile new york project is a further feather in their cap . klaus schirmer , head of production at the schilden company , which wove the sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow for " the gates , " said it was n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us , " schirmer told deutsche welle during the manufacturing stage last year . christo reportedly paid the weaving mill around € 400,000 -lrb- $ 524,000 -rrb- for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company . prestige for the tiny sewing workshop in taucha , which belonged to the communist east german government and has now been bought over by the swiss bieri group , the christo commission brought welcome relief to its workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bieri zeltaplan gmbh in taucha sews for christo 's " the gates " " it 's a nice change , " susann reihe , who has been stitching together the fabric panels for christo and jeanne-claude 's new york artwork for the past year in taucha , told german broadcaster wdr .
" we normally do protective weather-proof covers for cars , party-tents and the like , that demands a whole lot of painstaking work , " reihe said .
" this is really lovely in contrast . " christo 's project manager wolfgang volz said that the taucha-based bieri zeltaplan company had already proven its skills and quality during the reichstag wrapping project .
" at the time we had a really good experience with them , " volz told wdr .
" that 's why we approached them again . " roland eilenberger , head of bieri zeltaplan is clear that the commission has also brought the company much prestige in their line of work .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

28 . goya -lrb- 1746-1828 -rrb- was an extraordinarily versatile artist .
he was a brilliant painter of portraits and could at the same time forcefully present the horrors of war and suffering .
his famous oil paintings include " the naked maya " and " the shooting of street fighters by the french " . end of the war in germany berlin 's german historical museum and the museum of european cultures in dahlem are dedicating special exhibitions to the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 , 1945 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soviet soldier places his nation 's flag over the reichstag , the german parliament building in berlin on april 30 , 1945 , after the germans surrendered , ending world war ii .

the un is asking for concrete agreements , with deadlines attached . donor nations must speed up delivery of aid pledges for the asian tsunami relief effort and face public shame if they fail to live up to their promises , a top un official told a key conference in geneva on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami victim waits in line for food from unhcr aid in sri lanka jan egeland , the un emergency relief coordinator , said that of $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.6 billion -rrb- of formal aid pledges , only $ 300 million had been committed so far to projects , programs and assistance on the ground . " we need very quickly more signed contracts , more cash , more concrete commitments to help keep this massive effort going in the next six months , " he told reporters just before the geneva conference got underway . he said he expected it to produce a " large part " of the un appeal launched last week for $ 977 million for the next six months , and the rest would follow " soon . " un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped that the countries represented at the conference would collect a further billion dollars .
and in addition to mourning the dead , the world should now think of helping the living . " we must look forward , " annan said .

' humanity at its best ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami surviver asks for food from a us airforce soldier in aceh province , indonesia the conference under un auspices brought together representatives of more than 80 countries and organizations , as well as aid agencies and the stricken nations , to firm up promises and ensure better coordination of how , when and where aid is delivered . so far more than $ 8 billion has been pledged in an unprecedented worldwide display of government and public sympathy - " humanity at its very best , " egeland said . at the same time , he insisted other crises , notably in africa , must not be neglected . " it would be the ultimate disappointment for us and tragedy for the victims in all those other areas , where we are struggling to keep programs going on existing levels of assistance , were they to suffer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers load boxes of aid bound for banda aceh aid officials fear that as memories of the tsunami disaster fade , the amount actually delivered will diminish . the british charity oxfam said it was " crunch time " for the international community to ensure promises are kept .

after the december 2003 quake that levelled the iranian city of bam , the un asked for $ 333 million for immediate relief .
a year later , only $ 17 million had come through . the tracing system is being set up with us auditors pricewaterhousecoopers , who will also monitor how aid is delivered to make sure there is no misuse of funds . the offer by the us company , which un officials say is free of charge , came after scathing criticism of the way the un ran its controversial iraqi oil-for-food program under the regime of former leader saddam hussein . egeland promised an immediate investigation into any claims of mishandling aid money . bildunterschrift : survivor in sri lanka before the tsunami relief meeting , egeland appealed for more cash toward an appeal launched in november for 14 other needy regions , ranging from the democratic republic of congo to chechnya and the palestinian territories . while it was relatively easy getting international aid for iraq and kosovo , it was a " nightmare " trying to meet africa 's needs , he said , although there were up to 30 million people in desperate need of assistance . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.01.2005 cdu battles image problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are angela merkel 's chancellor chances rising or sinking ?
germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

the weak dollar may be making european cars more expensive , but german firms still want to claim at least 10 percent of the all-important us market . " german automakers have the potential to expand in the world 's biggest market , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german vda auto industry group , told the german press agency dpa .
" we believe we can crack the one-million mark in the coming years . " the germans last year sold only 883,000 cars in the united states , three percent less than in 2003 .
to counter the trend , daimlerchrysler , volkswagen and other manufacturers will introduce a slew of new models in detroit .
overall , 65 new car models will make their debut at the show . the volkswagen group will present the new jetta and audi 's a6 wagon , while bmw will show off its 5 series touring model and m5 sedan .

all five organisations are active in asia , africa and latin america . beyond immediate need a spokesperson for the new alliance said that while poor people are most vulnerable to the effects of a disaster such as the tsunami , assisting these people in a long-term effort could limit the consequences of a catastrophe in the future .
martin bröckelmann , head of misereor , said governments should also strive to eradicate the causes of extreme poverty and hunger in these regions when giving aid now . " in regions where wars are being waged and regimes rule that don ’ t care about the poor , the affects of the tsunami floods have been much more disastrous , " bröckelmann said .
" the poor are those who suffer most , and after catastrophes such as this , the lack of justice and equality in society becomes more apparent . " the new alliance is designed to merge the five organizations ' short-term disaster relief with long-term development aid . appeal to industrialized nations " we are an alliance of development aid organizations that all focus primarily on international justice and an end to poverty and exploitation , " said peter mucke , chief executive of terre des homes .
" the donations we receive are being spent on long-term projects in the first place , which means our support exists long before a disaster happens and continues long after it is no longer in the international spotlight . " the alliance 's representatives also urged industrialized nations not to forget their pledge made to the united nations to earmark 0.7 percent of their gdp to international development .
despite the generosity being shown by the german government and public in terms of donations for the tsunami victims , the alliance criticized the fact that germany is behind on its development promise , with just 0.28 percent of gdp currently being spent on aid . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rejects sending jobless to tsunami areas chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid .

but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
during a speech in wuppertal , germany , spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- said many jews in germany are feeling insecure .
he cited greater success of the radical right-wing npd and dvu parties , increased attacks on jewish cemeteries , and worrisome comments by public officials such the catholic archbishop joachim meisner , who recently compared abortion to the holocaust . influx from the east another issue creating a stir in german political circles is jewish immigration .
berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .
it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .

" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said .

many non-practicing jews were killed in the holocaust , when the standard of proof was simply whether one had jewish forebears .

eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .
the new rules are " ready for discussion in some areas , and in others fully unacceptable , " spiegel said .
" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said . ' fraud should be stopped ' michael lawton , who founded the gescher lamassoret liberal synagogue in cologne , noted that there is " general agreement , even in jewish community , that there is fraud in the application process , and that this fraud should be stopped . " the difficulty , though , is " coming to an agreement on who should be allowed in . " making applicants prove that they are currently involved in a jewish community in the cis presents a double standard , lawton explained .
many non-practicing jews were killed in the holocaust , when the standard of proof was simply whether one had jewish forebears .
" if the idea is to provide restitution for the holocaust or protect people from anti-semitism , then the same standard that applied during the holocaust should apply today , " he noted .

eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .

the weak dollar may be making european cars more expensive , but german firms still want to claim at least 10 percent of the all-important us market .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.01.2005 right wing solidarity plan called illegal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right wing nationalists hope to win more votes by joining forces experts have determined that an intended alliance between two german extreme-right political parties is likely illegal .
the npd and dvu had planned on a joint ticket for the 2006 national election . after reviewing a plan by the far-right nationalist npd and dvu parties to join forces on a common ticket and thereby garner more votes in the upcoming parliamentary election , a bundestag committee decided that " multiple-party polling lists are not allowed under the german voting law . " in october , chairmen for the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- put aside decades of rivalry and approved the plan for a joint voting list in 2006 . udo voigt -lrb- npd -rrb- and gerhard frey -lrb- dvu -rrb- apparently hoped that by joining forces rather than standing against one another , they could garner the 5 percent of votes needed to win a seat in the lower house of parliament .
they planned to sign the pact at an npd party congress this week . the nine-page official ruling is not legally binding , but it is a " helpful component in the political argument , " according to social democrat parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who called for the official examination of the situation .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

the weak dollar may be making european cars more expensive , but german firms still want to claim at least 10 percent of the all-important us market . " german automakers have the potential to expand in the world 's biggest market , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german vda auto industry group , told the german press agency dpa .
" we believe we can crack the one-million mark in the coming years . " the germans last year sold only 883,000 cars in the united states , three percent less than in 2003 .
to counter the trend , daimlerchrysler , volkswagen and other manufacturers will introduce a slew of new models in detroit .
overall , 65 new car models will make their debut at the show . the volkswagen group will present the new jetta and audi 's a6 wagon , while bmw will show off its 5 series touring model and m5 sedan .

some 60 exhibitors are looking to make a splash with concept sportscars , new trucks and sports utility vehicles and a number of new hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles .
american and asian automakers will dominate the headlines with highlights including ford 's convertible mustang , the dodge charger and honda 's first pickup truck . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jeep gladiator concept vehicle from german-controlled chrysler , on tap will be the jeep gladiator , described as a " flexible utility truck , " featuring an open-air canvas top , an expandable truck bed and a stow-away rear-seat cushion .
a high powered sportscar called firepower will also be unveiled . daimlerchrysler said sunday it also sees " potential " for its quirky , tiny smart cars in the united states , as it presented the vehicle at the detroit auto show .

the weak dollar may be making european cars more expensive , but german firms still want to claim at least 10 percent of the all-important us market . " german automakers have the potential to expand in the world 's biggest market , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german vda auto industry group , told the german press agency dpa .
" we believe we can crack the one-million mark in the coming years . " the germans last year sold only 883,000 cars in the united states , three percent less than in 2003 .
to counter the trend , daimlerchrysler , volkswagen and other manufacturers will introduce a slew of new models in detroit .
overall , 65 new car models will make their debut at the show . the volkswagen group will present the new jetta and audi 's a6 wagon , while bmw will show off its 5 series touring model and m5 sedan .
not to be left out , mercedes has new versions of the b , m and r-class and gm 's german unit opel will unveil a hybrid study model based on the astra . competing for attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2006 dodge charger but the competition for attention will be fierce .
some 60 exhibitors are looking to make a splash with concept sportscars , new trucks and sports utility vehicles and a number of new hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles .
american and asian automakers will dominate the headlines with highlights including ford 's convertible mustang , the dodge charger and honda 's first pickup truck . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jeep gladiator concept vehicle from german-controlled chrysler , on tap will be the jeep gladiator , described as a " flexible utility truck , " featuring an open-air canvas top , an expandable truck bed and a stow-away rear-seat cushion .
a high powered sportscar called firepower will also be unveiled . daimlerchrysler said sunday it also sees " potential " for its quirky , tiny smart cars in the united states , as it presented the vehicle at the detroit auto show .
the company said the us may take a cue from canada , which has been selling the smart car and a variant known as the smart " fortwo .

but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .

berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .

it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .

the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .

many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.01.2005 cdu battles image problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are angela merkel 's chancellor chances rising or sinking ?
germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .
the new rules are " ready for discussion in some areas , and in others fully unacceptable , " spiegel said .
" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said . ' fraud should be stopped ' michael lawton , who founded the gescher lamassoret liberal synagogue in cologne , noted that there is " general agreement , even in jewish community , that there is fraud in the application process , and that this fraud should be stopped . " the difficulty , though , is " coming to an agreement on who should be allowed in . " making applicants prove that they are currently involved in a jewish community in the cis presents a double standard , lawton explained .
many non-practicing jews were killed in the holocaust , when the standard of proof was simply whether one had jewish forebears .
" if the idea is to provide restitution for the holocaust or protect people from anti-semitism , then the same standard that applied during the holocaust should apply today , " he noted .
meanwhile , israel has spent the last decade urging the former soviet jews to apply for residency in the jewish state rather than germany .
a future for jews in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david denysenko participates in the ceremony marking the anniversary of the nationwide nazi pogrom of 1938 , in the synagogue in the city of regensburg .
david gall , who until recently published hagalil , an internet newspaper aimed at combating anti-semitism , agrees with the israelis .
eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .
the history of jews in germany should come to an end . "
on the outside , gall said , germany appears to have become open to judaism , with the government funding various initiatives to fight anti-semitism .
but for the most part , these are ineffective and empty , he said .
" this country does n't really want jews here .
there are signs of that everywhere , " he said bluntly .
but his personal opinion aside , gall says he understands why immigrants are choosing germany over israel .
" first of all , it is similar – the weather , the food , the culture .
look at a picture of st. petersburg and berlin , they 're not so different .
on the other hand , tel aviv is completely different .
also , the financial situation is more upbeat in germany , " he said .
finally , gall said , " there 's the question of security – in israel there are bombs going off in supermarkets .
that does n't really sound so appealing to people .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .
the new rules are " ready for discussion in some areas , and in others fully unacceptable , " spiegel said .
" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said . ' fraud should be stopped ' michael lawton , who founded the gescher lamassoret liberal synagogue in cologne , noted that there is " general agreement , even in jewish community , that there is fraud in the application process , and that this fraud should be stopped . " the difficulty , though , is " coming to an agreement on who should be allowed in . " making applicants prove that they are currently involved in a jewish community in the cis presents a double standard , lawton explained .

eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .
the new rules are " ready for discussion in some areas , and in others fully unacceptable , " spiegel said .
" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said . ' fraud should be stopped ' michael lawton , who founded the gescher lamassoret liberal synagogue in cologne , noted that there is " general agreement , even in jewish community , that there is fraud in the application process , and that this fraud should be stopped . " the difficulty , though , is " coming to an agreement on who should be allowed in . " making applicants prove that they are currently involved in a jewish community in the cis presents a double standard , lawton explained .
many non-practicing jews were killed in the holocaust , when the standard of proof was simply whether one had jewish forebears .
" if the idea is to provide restitution for the holocaust or protect people from anti-semitism , then the same standard that applied during the holocaust should apply today , " he noted .
meanwhile , israel has spent the last decade urging the former soviet jews to apply for residency in the jewish state rather than germany .
a future for jews in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david denysenko participates in the ceremony marking the anniversary of the nationwide nazi pogrom of 1938 , in the synagogue in the city of regensburg .
david gall , who until recently published hagalil , an internet newspaper aimed at combating anti-semitism , agrees with the israelis .
eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .
the history of jews in germany should come to an end . "
on the outside , gall said , germany appears to have become open to judaism , with the government funding various initiatives to fight anti-semitism .
but for the most part , these are ineffective and empty , he said .
" this country does n't really want jews here .
there are signs of that everywhere , " he said bluntly .
but his personal opinion aside , gall says he understands why immigrants are choosing germany over israel .
" first of all , it is similar – the weather , the food , the culture .
look at a picture of st. petersburg and berlin , they 're not so different .
on the other hand , tel aviv is completely different .
also , the financial situation is more upbeat in germany , " he said .
finally , gall said , " there 's the question of security – in israel there are bombs going off in supermarkets .
that does n't really sound so appealing to people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.01.2005 cdu battles image problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are angela merkel 's chancellor chances rising or sinking ?
germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .

but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
during a speech in wuppertal , germany , spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- said many jews in germany are feeling insecure .

berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .
it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

though he was born in breslau -lrb- in current day poland -rrb- like many berliners of the time and only migrated with his family to berlin when he was 16 , menzel came to epitomize the quintessential berliner . he was made an honorary citizen of the city in his old age and was even knighted shortly after that .
after his death on feb .

28 . goya -lrb- 1746-1828 -rrb- was an extraordinarily versatile artist .
he was a brilliant painter of portraits and could at the same time forcefully present the horrors of war and suffering .
his famous oil paintings include " the naked maya " and " the shooting of street fighters by the french " . end of the war in germany berlin 's german historical museum and the museum of european cultures in dahlem are dedicating special exhibitions to the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 , 1945 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soviet soldier places his nation 's flag over the reichstag , the german parliament building in berlin on april 30 , 1945 , after the germans surrendered , ending world war ii .

the un is asking for concrete agreements , with deadlines attached . donor nations must speed up delivery of aid pledges for the asian tsunami relief effort and face public shame if they fail to live up to their promises , a top un official told a key conference in geneva on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami victim waits in line for food from unhcr aid in sri lanka jan egeland , the un emergency relief coordinator , said that of $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.6 billion -rrb- of formal aid pledges , only $ 300 million had been committed so far to projects , programs and assistance on the ground . " we need very quickly more signed contracts , more cash , more concrete commitments to help keep this massive effort going in the next six months , " he told reporters just before the geneva conference got underway . he said he expected it to produce a " large part " of the un appeal launched last week for $ 977 million for the next six months , and the rest would follow " soon .

a german cardinal compared the act of abortion to the murder of millions by hitler and stalin .
although he says he regrets his statement and claims he was misunderstood , dw readers see the issue otherwise . the following comments reflect a cross-section of the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say , click on our feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
first they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew .
then they came for the communists and i did not speak out because i was not a communist.then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist .
then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me .
who will speak up for the defenseless unborn ?
i will . - susan larmour , usa ... from what i read , it seems as if cardinal meiser considers euthanasia , abortion , and the mass murders committed by the soviets and nazis as equally abhorrent .
he 's not condoning or sanctioning the holocaust against the jews ! ! ...
cardinal meiser has done nothing in my opinion that he needs to apologize for .
he 's not belittling the holocaust against the jews by making comparisons to the current holocaust against the unborn - he 's coming to their defense at a time when our cultural institutions are mercilessly drowning the ideal of the sanctity of human life -lrb- all human life -rrb- .
the holocaust against the jews was wrong , but so is abortion . - robert stalbow , usa i agree with the cardinal .
look at what mother teresa said , " the so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men .
it has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships .
it has aggravated the derogation of the father 's role in an increasingly fatherless society .
it has portrayed the greatest of gifts - a child - as a competitor , an intrusion , and an inconvenience .
it has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters . "
and , in granting this unconscionable power , it has exposed many women to unjust and selfish demands from their husbands or other sexual partners .
human rights are not a privilege conferred by government .
they are every human being 's entitlement by virtue of his humanity .
the right to life does not depend , and must not be declared to be contingent , on the pleasure of anyone else , not even a parent or a sovereign . "
mother teresa said about abortion . - doug petkoff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-abortion activist thomas schührer stands in a field of crosses in karlsbad on oct .
14 , 2003 .
the sign reads " 1,000 abortions a day in germany . "
i agree with meisner 's comments 100 % .
i am of jewish origin myself .
i do n't understand what is insulting .
his analogy is totally correct in that , in all three cases , innocent human lives are sacrificed for the sake of what is believed to be a higher good - racial purity , class cohesiveness , or individual comfort .
all three are rationalizations for murder . - edward it is a shame that many people get upset when someone in church condemns the killing of innocents , but the actual act of killing does n't offend these people with equal intensity .
sane individuals agree that hitler , stalin , et.al. were madmen among lesser known madmen , and have the blood of innocent jews , christians , and other enemies on their hands .
it is easy to see their guilt in the sheer number of carcasses that at one time held human souls and spirits .
they were men that decided the mortal fate of others .
innocent others .
these men played god .
not for a better idea , not for a love of god or their neighbor , but for total power .
unaccountable power ...
should we not hold life more dearly , than the love for self .
mr. spiegel , do n't be so offended by the comparison between the holocaust and abortion , it reveals you put more weight on reputation and memories than you do on the fate of innocent lives and the battle to save them from those of us that play god . - drew gish , usa the murdering of modern innocents is comparable to the atrocities of the nazis & stalin .
mass murder is mass murder , whether carried out against the generations of unborn or the generation of the holocaust .
those who continue to play the victim must grow up .
we are all victims .
we are all survivors .
we are all victors .
god and our own choices determines who we are ... - genetexas , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cardinal regrets holocaust remarks a german cardinal on saturday said he regretted comparing abortion to the genocides carried out by hitler and stalin , which sparked a public outcry here , and claimed to have been misunderstood . -lrb- jan.8,2005 -rrb- european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

a german cardinal compared the act of abortion to the murder of millions by hitler and stalin .
although he says he regrets his statement and claims he was misunderstood , dw readers see the issue otherwise . the following comments reflect a cross-section of the views of our readers .

first they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew .
then they came for the communists and i did not speak out because i was not a communist.then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist .
then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me .
who will speak up for the defenseless unborn ?
i will . - susan larmour , usa ... from what i read , it seems as if cardinal meiser considers euthanasia , abortion , and the mass murders committed by the soviets and nazis as equally abhorrent .
he 's not condoning or sanctioning the holocaust against the jews ! ! ...
cardinal meiser has done nothing in my opinion that he needs to apologize for .
he 's not belittling the holocaust against the jews by making comparisons to the current holocaust against the unborn - he 's coming to their defense at a time when our cultural institutions are mercilessly drowning the ideal of the sanctity of human life -lrb- all human life -rrb- .
the holocaust against the jews was wrong , but so is abortion . - robert stalbow , usa i agree with the cardinal .
look at what mother teresa said , " the so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men .
it has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships .
it has aggravated the derogation of the father 's role in an increasingly fatherless society .
it has portrayed the greatest of gifts - a child - as a competitor , an intrusion , and an inconvenience .
it has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters . "
and , in granting this unconscionable power , it has exposed many women to unjust and selfish demands from their husbands or other sexual partners .
human rights are not a privilege conferred by government .
they are every human being 's entitlement by virtue of his humanity .
the right to life does not depend , and must not be declared to be contingent , on the pleasure of anyone else , not even a parent or a sovereign . "

the npd and dvu had planned on a joint ticket for the 2006 national election . after reviewing a plan by the far-right nationalist npd and dvu parties to join forces on a common ticket and thereby garner more votes in the upcoming parliamentary election , a bundestag committee decided that " multiple-party polling lists are not allowed under the german voting law .

germany plays a role in their latest work in new york too , this time weaving and stitching their trademark fabric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrapped reichstag building in berlin a decade ago , christo and jeanne-claude created a sensation when they swaddled the german reichstag or parliament building in shimmering silver fabric for two weeks in a statement of berlin 's cold war east-west political divide . as the artist duo prepare for their latest art installation in new york - setting up 7,500 gates hung with panels of saffron-colored fabric in central park - germany is once again involved .
few know that much of the handiwork for " the gates , " as the new york art installation is called , was done across the atlantic in small workshops in sleepy german towns . and , as if in a continuing vein of the artists ' reichstag project , germany 's once divided halves are in it together : a manufacturing company in taucha near leipzig in eastern germany and a weaving mill in the town of emsdette , near münster in western germany , have labored separately to ensure that " the gates " opens as scheduled on feb .
12 . special commission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. artists christo , right , and jeanne-claude both companies have worked for the bulgarian-born christo and his french wife and co-artist jeanne-claude before . there 's little doubt that the high-profile new york project is a further feather in their cap . klaus schirmer , head of production at the schilden company , which wove the sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow for " the gates , " said it was n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us , " schirmer told deutsche welle during the manufacturing stage last year . christo reportedly paid the weaving mill around € 400,000 -lrb- $ 524,000 -rrb- for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company . prestige for the tiny sewing workshop in taucha , which belonged to the communist east german government and has now been bought over by the swiss bieri group , the christo commission brought welcome relief to its workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bieri zeltaplan gmbh in taucha sews for christo 's " the gates " " it 's a nice change , " susann reihe , who has been stitching together the fabric panels for christo and jeanne-claude 's new york artwork for the past year in taucha , told german broadcaster wdr .
" we normally do protective weather-proof covers for cars , party-tents and the like , that demands a whole lot of painstaking work , " reihe said .
" this is really lovely in contrast . " christo 's project manager wolfgang volz said that the taucha-based bieri zeltaplan company had already proven its skills and quality during the reichstag wrapping project .
" at the time we had a really good experience with them , " volz told wdr .
" that 's why we approached them again . " roland eilenberger , head of bieri zeltaplan is clear that the commission has also brought the company much prestige in their line of work . " naturally , you ca n't market such a project in the same way that you would perhaps bring out a luxurious product on the market , " eilenberger said .
" but , overall , in the textile industry it 's pretty unique to able to work and complete such a mammoth project . " the company shipped off the last of the fabric panels to new york last november . gigantic artworks " the gates " is just the latest in a string of gigantic public art pieces that the conceptual artists are known for , most of which have involved wrapping swathes of fabric around massive objects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus , the wrapping of the reichstag and opening 3,100 umbrellas in japan and california . " the gates , " which like most of the artist duo 's works is monumental but temporary , will consist of five-meter-high gates placed at intervals of about 3.5 meters along 37 kilometers of footpaths throughout new york 's central park .
the saffron-colored fabric panels will be suspended from each gate , falling to two meters above the ground . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks . as with most of christo and jeanne-claude 's projects , the fabric is central to the installation .
this time the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de weaving for art 's sake artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .
this time too , a weaving mill in germany is spinning out the fibers .

germany plays a role in their latest work in new york too , this time weaving and stitching their trademark fabric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrapped reichstag building in berlin a decade ago , christo and jeanne-claude created a sensation when they swaddled the german reichstag or parliament building in shimmering silver fabric for two weeks in a statement of berlin 's cold war east-west political divide . as the artist duo prepare for their latest art installation in new york - setting up 7,500 gates hung with panels of saffron-colored fabric in central park - germany is once again involved .
few know that much of the handiwork for " the gates , " as the new york art installation is called , was done across the atlantic in small workshops in sleepy german towns . and , as if in a continuing vein of the artists ' reichstag project , germany 's once divided halves are in it together : a manufacturing company in taucha near leipzig in eastern germany and a weaving mill in the town of emsdette , near münster in western germany , have labored separately to ensure that " the gates " opens as scheduled on feb .
12 . special commission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. artists christo , right , and jeanne-claude both companies have worked for the bulgarian-born christo and his french wife and co-artist jeanne-claude before . there 's little doubt that the high-profile new york project is a further feather in their cap . klaus schirmer , head of production at the schilden company , which wove the sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow for " the gates , " said it was n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us , " schirmer told deutsche welle during the manufacturing stage last year . christo reportedly paid the weaving mill around € 400,000 -lrb- $ 524,000 -rrb- for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company . prestige for the tiny sewing workshop in taucha , which belonged to the communist east german government and has now been bought over by the swiss bieri group , the christo commission brought welcome relief to its workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bieri zeltaplan gmbh in taucha sews for christo 's " the gates " " it 's a nice change , " susann reihe , who has been stitching together the fabric panels for christo and jeanne-claude 's new york artwork for the past year in taucha , told german broadcaster wdr .
" we normally do protective weather-proof covers for cars , party-tents and the like , that demands a whole lot of painstaking work , " reihe said .
" this is really lovely in contrast . " christo 's project manager wolfgang volz said that the taucha-based bieri zeltaplan company had already proven its skills and quality during the reichstag wrapping project .
" at the time we had a really good experience with them , " volz told wdr .
" that 's why we approached them again . " roland eilenberger , head of bieri zeltaplan is clear that the commission has also brought the company much prestige in their line of work . " naturally , you ca n't market such a project in the same way that you would perhaps bring out a luxurious product on the market , " eilenberger said .
" but , overall , in the textile industry it 's pretty unique to able to work and complete such a mammoth project . " the company shipped off the last of the fabric panels to new york last november . gigantic artworks " the gates " is just the latest in a string of gigantic public art pieces that the conceptual artists are known for , most of which have involved wrapping swathes of fabric around massive objects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus , the wrapping of the reichstag and opening 3,100 umbrellas in japan and california . " the gates , " which like most of the artist duo 's works is monumental but temporary , will consist of five-meter-high gates placed at intervals of about 3.5 meters along 37 kilometers of footpaths throughout new york 's central park .
the saffron-colored fabric panels will be suspended from each gate , falling to two meters above the ground . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks . as with most of christo and jeanne-claude 's projects , the fabric is central to the installation .
this time the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de weaving for art 's sake artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .

the un is asking for concrete agreements , with deadlines attached . donor nations must speed up delivery of aid pledges for the asian tsunami relief effort and face public shame if they fail to live up to their promises , a top un official told a key conference in geneva on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami victim waits in line for food from unhcr aid in sri lanka jan egeland , the un emergency relief coordinator , said that of $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.6 billion -rrb- of formal aid pledges , only $ 300 million had been committed so far to projects , programs and assistance on the ground . " we need very quickly more signed contracts , more cash , more concrete commitments to help keep this massive effort going in the next six months , " he told reporters just before the geneva conference got underway . he said he expected it to produce a " large part " of the un appeal launched last week for $ 977 million for the next six months , and the rest would follow " soon . " un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped that the countries represented at the conference would collect a further billion dollars .
and in addition to mourning the dead , the world should now think of helping the living . " we must look forward , " annan said .

after the december 2003 quake that levelled the iranian city of bam , the un asked for $ 333 million for immediate relief .

the un is asking for concrete agreements , with deadlines attached . donor nations must speed up delivery of aid pledges for the asian tsunami relief effort and face public shame if they fail to live up to their promises , a top un official told a key conference in geneva on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami victim waits in line for food from unhcr aid in sri lanka jan egeland , the un emergency relief coordinator , said that of $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.6 billion -rrb- of formal aid pledges , only $ 300 million had been committed so far to projects , programs and assistance on the ground . " we need very quickly more signed contracts , more cash , more concrete commitments to help keep this massive effort going in the next six months , " he told reporters just before the geneva conference got underway . he said he expected it to produce a " large part " of the un appeal launched last week for $ 977 million for the next six months , and the rest would follow " soon . " un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped that the countries represented at the conference would collect a further billion dollars .
and in addition to mourning the dead , the world should now think of helping the living . " we must look forward , " annan said .
taking care of children in desperate situations is the first priority of the un programs , he added . but egeland warned that if remaining pledges were not also turned into reality , victims of the dec .
26 killer waves , which left more than 157,000 people dead , would feel short-changed .

28 . goya -lrb- 1746-1828 -rrb- was an extraordinarily versatile artist .
he was a brilliant painter of portraits and could at the same time forcefully present the horrors of war and suffering .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .

the weak dollar may be making european cars more expensive , but german firms still want to claim at least 10 percent of the all-important us market . " german automakers have the potential to expand in the world 's biggest market , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german vda auto industry group , told the german press agency dpa .
" we believe we can crack the one-million mark in the coming years . " the germans last year sold only 883,000 cars in the united states , three percent less than in 2003 .
to counter the trend , daimlerchrysler , volkswagen and other manufacturers will introduce a slew of new models in detroit .
overall , 65 new car models will make their debut at the show . the volkswagen group will present the new jetta and audi 's a6 wagon , while bmw will show off its 5 series touring model and m5 sedan .
not to be left out , mercedes has new versions of the b , m and r-class and gm 's german unit opel will unveil a hybrid study model based on the astra . competing for attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2006 dodge charger but the competition for attention will be fierce .
some 60 exhibitors are looking to make a splash with concept sportscars , new trucks and sports utility vehicles and a number of new hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles .
american and asian automakers will dominate the headlines with highlights including ford 's convertible mustang , the dodge charger and honda 's first pickup truck . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jeep gladiator concept vehicle from german-controlled chrysler , on tap will be the jeep gladiator , described as a " flexible utility truck , " featuring an open-air canvas top , an expandable truck bed and a stow-away rear-seat cushion .
a high powered sportscar called firepower will also be unveiled . daimlerchrysler said sunday it also sees " potential " for its quirky , tiny smart cars in the united states , as it presented the vehicle at the detroit auto show .
the company said the us may take a cue from canada , which has been selling the smart car and a variant known as the smart " fortwo . " " following the very successful start in canada , we see potential for smart in the us , too , " said eckhard cordes , board member of daimlerchrysler from the mercedes car group .
" smart has become a strong and important brand of the mercedes car group , " cordes added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart city coupe originally developed as a joint venture between the swiss watch company swatch and mercedes-benz , the brand is now a 100 percent-owned subsidiary of daimlerchrysler and part of the mercedes car group , but has been losing money and only the past week , rumors were circulating about a possible end to the ultra-small car . euro pressure on exports although german exports to the us totaled € 22 billion -lrb- $ 28.8 billion -rrb- in 2004 , gottschalk from the vda said the continuing weakness of the us dollar was of great concern to european carmakers .
he said the industry was counting on support from berlin , since there could be political motivation in keeping the greenback from rebounding . " the current exchange course developments between the euro and dollar have nothing to do with the actual conditions regarding both economies , " said gottschalk . he said the strong euro would compel the german auto industry to consider moving production to north america at some point .

all five organisations are active in asia , africa and latin america . beyond immediate need a spokesperson for the new alliance said that while poor people are most vulnerable to the effects of a disaster such as the tsunami , assisting these people in a long-term effort could limit the consequences of a catastrophe in the future .
martin bröckelmann , head of misereor , said governments should also strive to eradicate the causes of extreme poverty and hunger in these regions when giving aid now .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .
the new rules are " ready for discussion in some areas , and in others fully unacceptable , " spiegel said .
" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said . ' fraud should be stopped ' michael lawton , who founded the gescher lamassoret liberal synagogue in cologne , noted that there is " general agreement , even in jewish community , that there is fraud in the application process , and that this fraud should be stopped . " the difficulty , though , is " coming to an agreement on who should be allowed in . " making applicants prove that they are currently involved in a jewish community in the cis presents a double standard , lawton explained .
many non-practicing jews were killed in the holocaust , when the standard of proof was simply whether one had jewish forebears .
" if the idea is to provide restitution for the holocaust or protect people from anti-semitism , then the same standard that applied during the holocaust should apply today , " he noted .
meanwhile , israel has spent the last decade urging the former soviet jews to apply for residency in the jewish state rather than germany .
a future for jews in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david denysenko participates in the ceremony marking the anniversary of the nationwide nazi pogrom of 1938 , in the synagogue in the city of regensburg .
david gall , who until recently published hagalil , an internet newspaper aimed at combating anti-semitism , agrees with the israelis .
eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .
the history of jews in germany should come to an end . "
on the outside , gall said , germany appears to have become open to judaism , with the government funding various initiatives to fight anti-semitism .
but for the most part , these are ineffective and empty , he said .
" this country does n't really want jews here .
there are signs of that everywhere , " he said bluntly .
but his personal opinion aside , gall says he understands why immigrants are choosing germany over israel .
" first of all , it is similar – the weather , the food , the culture .
look at a picture of st. petersburg and berlin , they 're not so different .
on the other hand , tel aviv is completely different .
also , the financial situation is more upbeat in germany , " he said .
finally , gall said , " there 's the question of security – in israel there are bombs going off in supermarkets .
that does n't really sound so appealing to people .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .
the new rules are " ready for discussion in some areas , and in others fully unacceptable , " spiegel said .
" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said . ' fraud should be stopped ' michael lawton , who founded the gescher lamassoret liberal synagogue in cologne , noted that there is " general agreement , even in jewish community , that there is fraud in the application process , and that this fraud should be stopped . " the difficulty , though , is " coming to an agreement on who should be allowed in . " making applicants prove that they are currently involved in a jewish community in the cis presents a double standard , lawton explained .
many non-practicing jews were killed in the holocaust , when the standard of proof was simply whether one had jewish forebears .
" if the idea is to provide restitution for the holocaust or protect people from anti-semitism , then the same standard that applied during the holocaust should apply today , " he noted .
meanwhile , israel has spent the last decade urging the former soviet jews to apply for residency in the jewish state rather than germany .
a future for jews in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david denysenko participates in the ceremony marking the anniversary of the nationwide nazi pogrom of 1938 , in the synagogue in the city of regensburg .
david gall , who until recently published hagalil , an internet newspaper aimed at combating anti-semitism , agrees with the israelis .
eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .
the history of jews in germany should come to an end . "
on the outside , gall said , germany appears to have become open to judaism , with the government funding various initiatives to fight anti-semitism .
but for the most part , these are ineffective and empty , he said .
" this country does n't really want jews here .
there are signs of that everywhere , " he said bluntly .
but his personal opinion aside , gall says he understands why immigrants are choosing germany over israel .
" first of all , it is similar – the weather , the food , the culture .
look at a picture of st. petersburg and berlin , they 're not so different .
on the other hand , tel aviv is completely different .
also , the financial situation is more upbeat in germany , " he said .
finally , gall said , " there 's the question of security – in israel there are bombs going off in supermarkets .
that does n't really sound so appealing to people .

germany plays a role in their latest work in new york too , this time weaving and stitching their trademark fabric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrapped reichstag building in berlin a decade ago , christo and jeanne-claude created a sensation when they swaddled the german reichstag or parliament building in shimmering silver fabric for two weeks in a statement of berlin 's cold war east-west political divide . as the artist duo prepare for their latest art installation in new york - setting up 7,500 gates hung with panels of saffron-colored fabric in central park - germany is once again involved .
few know that much of the handiwork for " the gates , " as the new york art installation is called , was done across the atlantic in small workshops in sleepy german towns . and , as if in a continuing vein of the artists ' reichstag project , germany 's once divided halves are in it together : a manufacturing company in taucha near leipzig in eastern germany and a weaving mill in the town of emsdette , near münster in western germany , have labored separately to ensure that " the gates " opens as scheduled on feb .
12 . special commission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. artists christo , right , and jeanne-claude both companies have worked for the bulgarian-born christo and his french wife and co-artist jeanne-claude before . there 's little doubt that the high-profile new york project is a further feather in their cap . klaus schirmer , head of production at the schilden company , which wove the sturdy sheets of polyamide imprinted with an intricate honeycomb design in saffron yellow for " the gates , " said it was n't a routine commission . " it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us , " schirmer told deutsche welle during the manufacturing stage last year . christo reportedly paid the weaving mill around € 400,000 -lrb- $ 524,000 -rrb- for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company . prestige for the tiny sewing workshop in taucha , which belonged to the communist east german government and has now been bought over by the swiss bieri group , the christo commission brought welcome relief to its workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bieri zeltaplan gmbh in taucha sews for christo 's " the gates " " it 's a nice change , " susann reihe , who has been stitching together the fabric panels for christo and jeanne-claude 's new york artwork for the past year in taucha , told german broadcaster wdr .
" we normally do protective weather-proof covers for cars , party-tents and the like , that demands a whole lot of painstaking work , " reihe said .
" this is really lovely in contrast . " christo 's project manager wolfgang volz said that the taucha-based bieri zeltaplan company had already proven its skills and quality during the reichstag wrapping project .
" at the time we had a really good experience with them , " volz told wdr .
" that 's why we approached them again . " roland eilenberger , head of bieri zeltaplan is clear that the commission has also brought the company much prestige in their line of work . " naturally , you ca n't market such a project in the same way that you would perhaps bring out a luxurious product on the market , " eilenberger said .
" but , overall , in the textile industry it 's pretty unique to able to work and complete such a mammoth project . " the company shipped off the last of the fabric panels to new york last november . gigantic artworks " the gates " is just the latest in a string of gigantic public art pieces that the conceptual artists are known for , most of which have involved wrapping swathes of fabric around massive objects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus , the wrapping of the reichstag and opening 3,100 umbrellas in japan and california . " the gates , " which like most of the artist duo 's works is monumental but temporary , will consist of five-meter-high gates placed at intervals of about 3.5 meters along 37 kilometers of footpaths throughout new york 's central park .
the saffron-colored fabric panels will be suspended from each gate , falling to two meters above the ground . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks . as with most of christo and jeanne-claude 's projects , the fabric is central to the installation .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .

28 . goya -lrb- 1746-1828 -rrb- was an extraordinarily versatile artist .
he was a brilliant painter of portraits and could at the same time forcefully present the horrors of war and suffering .
his famous oil paintings include " the naked maya " and " the shooting of street fighters by the french " . end of the war in germany berlin 's german historical museum and the museum of european cultures in dahlem are dedicating special exhibitions to the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 , 1945 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soviet soldier places his nation 's flag over the reichstag , the german parliament building in berlin on april 30 , 1945 , after the germans surrendered , ending world war ii .

a german cardinal compared the act of abortion to the murder of millions by hitler and stalin .

then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me .
who will speak up for the defenseless unborn ?
i will . - susan larmour , usa ... from what i read , it seems as if cardinal meiser considers euthanasia , abortion , and the mass murders committed by the soviets and nazis as equally abhorrent .
he 's not condoning or sanctioning the holocaust against the jews ! ! ...
cardinal meiser has done nothing in my opinion that he needs to apologize for .
he 's not belittling the holocaust against the jews by making comparisons to the current holocaust against the unborn - he 's coming to their defense at a time when our cultural institutions are mercilessly drowning the ideal of the sanctity of human life -lrb- all human life -rrb- .
the holocaust against the jews was wrong , but so is abortion . - robert stalbow , usa i agree with the cardinal .
look at what mother teresa said , " the so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men .
it has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships .
it has aggravated the derogation of the father 's role in an increasingly fatherless society .
it has portrayed the greatest of gifts - a child - as a competitor , an intrusion , and an inconvenience .
it has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters . "
and , in granting this unconscionable power , it has exposed many women to unjust and selfish demands from their husbands or other sexual partners .
human rights are not a privilege conferred by government .
they are every human being 's entitlement by virtue of his humanity .
the right to life does not depend , and must not be declared to be contingent , on the pleasure of anyone else , not even a parent or a sovereign . "

his analogy is totally correct in that , in all three cases , innocent human lives are sacrificed for the sake of what is believed to be a higher good - racial purity , class cohesiveness , or individual comfort .
all three are rationalizations for murder . - edward it is a shame that many people get upset when someone in church condemns the killing of innocents , but the actual act of killing does n't offend these people with equal intensity .
sane individuals agree that hitler , stalin , et.al. were madmen among lesser known madmen , and have the blood of innocent jews , christians , and other enemies on their hands .
it is easy to see their guilt in the sheer number of carcasses that at one time held human souls and spirits .

mr. spiegel , do n't be so offended by the comparison between the holocaust and abortion , it reveals you put more weight on reputation and memories than you do on the fate of innocent lives and the battle to save them from those of us that play god . - drew gish , usa the murdering of modern innocents is comparable to the atrocities of the nazis & stalin .
mass murder is mass murder , whether carried out against the generations of unborn or the generation of the holocaust .

beiersdorf said in a statement it booked net profit of around € 300 million -lrb- $ 393 million -rrb- in 2004 , equivalent to more than six percent of sales .
it did not provide a comparable year-earlier figure , but the 2003 annual report published on beiersdorf 's website put the bottom-line 2003 profit at € 301 million .
operating profit , as measured by earnings before interest and tax -lrb- ebit -rrb- , was also slightly lower , amounting to € 480 million in 2004 compared with € 484 million in 2003 .
group sales rose by a modest 2.5 percent to € 4.546 billion .
the operating profit margin was therefore " well above 10 percent " .
looking ahead to the current year , beiersdorf said it expected the difficult environment to continue .
nevertheless , sales were expected to grow faster than in 2004 .
in terms of profit margins , pre-tax profit was expected to reach about 11 percent of sales , and net profit would amount to close to seven percent of sales , beiersdorf said . more briefs 11.01.2005 -pipe- bmw drives on to new sales records in 2004 11.01.2005 -pipe- karstadtquelle sales fall in 2004 10.01.2005 -pipe- handelsblatt acquires stake in bulgarian newspapers 10.01.2005 -pipe- german steel production high in 2004 10.01.2005 -pipe- daimlerchrysler lifts overall sales of 2004 10.01.2005 -pipe- bayer acquires marketing rights for levitra 09.01.2005 -pipe- 2004 budget deficit less than thought 07.01.2005 -pipe- car market on road to recovery radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the npd and dvu had planned on a joint ticket for the 2006 national election . after reviewing a plan by the far-right nationalist npd and dvu parties to join forces on a common ticket and thereby garner more votes in the upcoming parliamentary election , a bundestag committee decided that " multiple-party polling lists are not allowed under the german voting law . " in october , chairmen for the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- put aside decades of rivalry and approved the plan for a joint voting list in 2006 . udo voigt -lrb- npd -rrb- and gerhard frey -lrb- dvu -rrb- apparently hoped that by joining forces rather than standing against one another , they could garner the 5 percent of votes needed to win a seat in the lower house of parliament .
they planned to sign the pact at an npd party congress this week . the nine-page official ruling is not legally binding , but it is a " helpful component in the political argument , " according to social democrat parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who called for the official examination of the situation . " i assume that the german election supervisor will not allow an alliance of the sort that the dvu and npd are planning , " edathy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd protest against government attempts to ban the party in 2003 .
indeed , the ruling appears to clarify that the npd and dvu , both of which have close ties to neo-nazis , will not be allowed to stand together on the bundestag ballot in 2006 . " it is comforting to think that the plans these two right radical men had wo n't be put into action , " said edathy , who is the spokesman for the spd parliamentary party 's committee on right extremism and violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo voigt , left , chairman of the npd and gerhard frey of the dvu after reunification , there was a discussion of creating multiple-party voting lists , but the german constitutional court decided in 1990 that these would be anticonstitutional . in september , the npd and dvu shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 and 6.1 percent of the votes in regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern states of saxony and brandenburg . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right party rejects extremist alliance german far-right party the republicans voted over the weekend to opt out of an political alliance with two other fringe groups , dashing hopes of creating an extremist juggernaut ahead of the 2006 national election .

the weak dollar may be making european cars more expensive , but german firms still want to claim at least 10 percent of the all-important us market . " german automakers have the potential to expand in the world 's biggest market , " bernd gottschalk , president of the german vda auto industry group , told the german press agency dpa .
" we believe we can crack the one-million mark in the coming years . " the germans last year sold only 883,000 cars in the united states , three percent less than in 2003 .
to counter the trend , daimlerchrysler , volkswagen and other manufacturers will introduce a slew of new models in detroit .
overall , 65 new car models will make their debut at the show . the volkswagen group will present the new jetta and audi 's a6 wagon , while bmw will show off its 5 series touring model and m5 sedan .
not to be left out , mercedes has new versions of the b , m and r-class and gm 's german unit opel will unveil a hybrid study model based on the astra . competing for attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2006 dodge charger but the competition for attention will be fierce .
some 60 exhibitors are looking to make a splash with concept sportscars , new trucks and sports utility vehicles and a number of new hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles .
american and asian automakers will dominate the headlines with highlights including ford 's convertible mustang , the dodge charger and honda 's first pickup truck . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jeep gladiator concept vehicle from german-controlled chrysler , on tap will be the jeep gladiator , described as a " flexible utility truck , " featuring an open-air canvas top , an expandable truck bed and a stow-away rear-seat cushion .
a high powered sportscar called firepower will also be unveiled . daimlerchrysler said sunday it also sees " potential " for its quirky , tiny smart cars in the united states , as it presented the vehicle at the detroit auto show .
the company said the us may take a cue from canada , which has been selling the smart car and a variant known as the smart " fortwo . " " following the very successful start in canada , we see potential for smart in the us , too , " said eckhard cordes , board member of daimlerchrysler from the mercedes car group .
" smart has become a strong and important brand of the mercedes car group , " cordes added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart city coupe originally developed as a joint venture between the swiss watch company swatch and mercedes-benz , the brand is now a 100 percent-owned subsidiary of daimlerchrysler and part of the mercedes car group , but has been losing money and only the past week , rumors were circulating about a possible end to the ultra-small car . euro pressure on exports although german exports to the us totaled € 22 billion -lrb- $ 28.8 billion -rrb- in 2004 , gottschalk from the vda said the continuing weakness of the us dollar was of great concern to european carmakers .
he said the industry was counting on support from berlin , since there could be political motivation in keeping the greenback from rebounding . " the current exchange course developments between the euro and dollar have nothing to do with the actual conditions regarding both economies , " said gottschalk . he said the strong euro would compel the german auto industry to consider moving production to north america at some point .

berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .

berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .

the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .

many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .
the new rules are " ready for discussion in some areas , and in others fully unacceptable , " spiegel said .
" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said . ' fraud should be stopped ' michael lawton , who founded the gescher lamassoret liberal synagogue in cologne , noted that there is " general agreement , even in jewish community , that there is fraud in the application process , and that this fraud should be stopped . " the difficulty , though , is " coming to an agreement on who should be allowed in . " making applicants prove that they are currently involved in a jewish community in the cis presents a double standard , lawton explained .
many non-practicing jews were killed in the holocaust , when the standard of proof was simply whether one had jewish forebears .
" if the idea is to provide restitution for the holocaust or protect people from anti-semitism , then the same standard that applied during the holocaust should apply today , " he noted .
meanwhile , israel has spent the last decade urging the former soviet jews to apply for residency in the jewish state rather than germany .
a future for jews in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david denysenko participates in the ceremony marking the anniversary of the nationwide nazi pogrom of 1938 , in the synagogue in the city of regensburg .
david gall , who until recently published hagalil , an internet newspaper aimed at combating anti-semitism , agrees with the israelis .
eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .
the history of jews in germany should come to an end . "
on the outside , gall said , germany appears to have become open to judaism , with the government funding various initiatives to fight anti-semitism .
but for the most part , these are ineffective and empty , he said .
" this country does n't really want jews here .
there are signs of that everywhere , " he said bluntly .
but his personal opinion aside , gall says he understands why immigrants are choosing germany over israel .
" first of all , it is similar – the weather , the food , the culture .
look at a picture of st. petersburg and berlin , they 're not so different .
on the other hand , tel aviv is completely different .
also , the financial situation is more upbeat in germany , " he said .
finally , gall said , " there 's the question of security – in israel there are bombs going off in supermarkets .
that does n't really sound so appealing to people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.01.2005 jews in germany feel winds of change 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of jews means new synagogues have been opened as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry . anti-semitism in europe and the strengthening of the inter-religious dialogue were at the forefront of the two-day meeting of the world jewish congress .
but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
during a speech in wuppertal , germany , spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- said many jews in germany are feeling insecure .
he cited greater success of the radical right-wing npd and dvu parties , increased attacks on jewish cemeteries , and worrisome comments by public officials such the catholic archbishop joachim meisner , who recently compared abortion to the holocaust . influx from the east another issue creating a stir in german political circles is jewish immigration .
berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .
it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .

berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .

but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
during a speech in wuppertal , germany , spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- said many jews in germany are feeling insecure .
he cited greater success of the radical right-wing npd and dvu parties , increased attacks on jewish cemeteries , and worrisome comments by public officials such the catholic archbishop joachim meisner , who recently compared abortion to the holocaust . influx from the east another issue creating a stir in german political circles is jewish immigration .
berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .
it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .

" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said .

eastern european jews should move to israel instead of germany because " there is no future for jews in germany .

new regulations while no official information has been released , news reports say the regulations would likely require the immigrants to have knowledge of german and the skills to get a job in germany , be under the age of 45 - and have a certificate of membership from the jewish community in their home country .
in a late-december interview with reuters news service , the central council said it was opposed to the immigration restriction plan .
the new rules are " ready for discussion in some areas , and in others fully unacceptable , " spiegel said .
" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " spiegel said . ' fraud should be stopped ' michael lawton , who founded the gescher lamassoret liberal synagogue in cologne , noted that there is " general agreement , even in jewish community , that there is fraud in the application process , and that this fraud should be stopped . " the difficulty , though , is " coming to an agreement on who should be allowed in . " making applicants prove that they are currently involved in a jewish community in the cis presents a double standard , lawton explained .
many non-practicing jews were killed in the holocaust , when the standard of proof was simply whether one had jewish forebears .
" if the idea is to provide restitution for the holocaust or protect people from anti-semitism , then the same standard that applied during the holocaust should apply today , " he noted .

few know that much of the handiwork for " the gates , " as the new york art installation is called , was done across the atlantic in small workshops in sleepy german towns . and , as if in a continuing vein of the artists ' reichstag project , germany 's once divided halves are in it together : a manufacturing company in taucha near leipzig in eastern germany and a weaving mill in the town of emsdette , near münster in western germany , have labored separately to ensure that " the gates " opens as scheduled on feb .

" it is definitely special .
it 's probably not everyday that one can associate art with a technical weaving mill .
thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us , " schirmer told deutsche welle during the manufacturing stage last year . christo reportedly paid the weaving mill around € 400,000 -lrb- $ 524,000 -rrb- for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company . prestige for the tiny sewing workshop in taucha , which belonged to the communist east german government and has now been bought over by the swiss bieri group , the christo commission brought welcome relief to its workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bieri zeltaplan gmbh in taucha sews for christo 's " the gates " " it 's a nice change , " susann reihe , who has been stitching together the fabric panels for christo and jeanne-claude 's new york artwork for the past year in taucha , told german broadcaster wdr .
" we normally do protective weather-proof covers for cars , party-tents and the like , that demands a whole lot of painstaking work , " reihe said .
" this is really lovely in contrast . " christo 's project manager wolfgang volz said that the taucha-based bieri zeltaplan company had already proven its skills and quality during the reichstag wrapping project .
" at the time we had a really good experience with them , " volz told wdr .
" that 's why we approached them again . " roland eilenberger , head of bieri zeltaplan is clear that the commission has also brought the company much prestige in their line of work . " naturally , you ca n't market such a project in the same way that you would perhaps bring out a luxurious product on the market , " eilenberger said .
" but , overall , in the textile industry it 's pretty unique to able to work and complete such a mammoth project . " the company shipped off the last of the fabric panels to new york last november . gigantic artworks " the gates " is just the latest in a string of gigantic public art pieces that the conceptual artists are known for , most of which have involved wrapping swathes of fabric around massive objects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus , the wrapping of the reichstag and opening 3,100 umbrellas in japan and california . " the gates , " which like most of the artist duo 's works is monumental but temporary , will consist of five-meter-high gates placed at intervals of about 3.5 meters along 37 kilometers of footpaths throughout new york 's central park .
the saffron-colored fabric panels will be suspended from each gate , falling to two meters above the ground . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks . as with most of christo and jeanne-claude 's projects , the fabric is central to the installation .

thus this whole christo thing is really special and of course very , very important to us , " schirmer told deutsche welle during the manufacturing stage last year . christo reportedly paid the weaving mill around € 400,000 -lrb- $ 524,000 -rrb- for 100,000 square meters of polyamide textile , the normal price according to the company . prestige for the tiny sewing workshop in taucha , which belonged to the communist east german government and has now been bought over by the swiss bieri group , the christo commission brought welcome relief to its workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bieri zeltaplan gmbh in taucha sews for christo 's " the gates " " it 's a nice change , " susann reihe , who has been stitching together the fabric panels for christo and jeanne-claude 's new york artwork for the past year in taucha , told german broadcaster wdr .
" we normally do protective weather-proof covers for cars , party-tents and the like , that demands a whole lot of painstaking work , " reihe said .
" this is really lovely in contrast . " christo 's project manager wolfgang volz said that the taucha-based bieri zeltaplan company had already proven its skills and quality during the reichstag wrapping project .
" at the time we had a really good experience with them , " volz told wdr .
" that 's why we approached them again . " roland eilenberger , head of bieri zeltaplan is clear that the commission has also brought the company much prestige in their line of work . " naturally , you ca n't market such a project in the same way that you would perhaps bring out a luxurious product on the market , " eilenberger said .
" but , overall , in the textile industry it 's pretty unique to able to work and complete such a mammoth project . " the company shipped off the last of the fabric panels to new york last november . gigantic artworks " the gates " is just the latest in a string of gigantic public art pieces that the conceptual artists are known for , most of which have involved wrapping swathes of fabric around massive objects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and jeanne-claude with a model of the " wrapped reichstag " from 1995 among their more memorable projects , was a hanging of a curtain between two peaks in a colorado valley , wrapping the pont neuf in paris , embellishing several islands off florida with tutus , the wrapping of the reichstag and opening 3,100 umbrellas in japan and california . " the gates , " which like most of the artist duo 's works is monumental but temporary , will consist of five-meter-high gates placed at intervals of about 3.5 meters along 37 kilometers of footpaths throughout new york 's central park .
the saffron-colored fabric panels will be suspended from each gate , falling to two meters above the ground . the installation is designed to pay tribute to the park 's half-planned topography as well as to evoke the structure of the surrounding city blocks . as with most of christo and jeanne-claude 's projects , the fabric is central to the installation .
this time the saffron color is meant to symbolize a park in full bloom . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de weaving for art 's sake artist duo christo and jeanne-claude , known for swaddling berlin 's reichstag in fabric in 1995 , are preparing a new textile installation in new york .

the npd and dvu had planned on a joint ticket for the 2006 national election . after reviewing a plan by the far-right nationalist npd and dvu parties to join forces on a common ticket and thereby garner more votes in the upcoming parliamentary election , a bundestag committee decided that " multiple-party polling lists are not allowed under the german voting law .

they planned to sign the pact at an npd party congress this week . the nine-page official ruling is not legally binding , but it is a " helpful component in the political argument , " according to social democrat parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who called for the official examination of the situation .

the un is asking for concrete agreements , with deadlines attached . donor nations must speed up delivery of aid pledges for the asian tsunami relief effort and face public shame if they fail to live up to their promises , a top un official told a key conference in geneva on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami victim waits in line for food from unhcr aid in sri lanka jan egeland , the un emergency relief coordinator , said that of $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.6 billion -rrb- of formal aid pledges , only $ 300 million had been committed so far to projects , programs and assistance on the ground . " we need very quickly more signed contracts , more cash , more concrete commitments to help keep this massive effort going in the next six months , " he told reporters just before the geneva conference got underway . he said he expected it to produce a " large part " of the un appeal launched last week for $ 977 million for the next six months , and the rest would follow " soon . " un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped that the countries represented at the conference would collect a further billion dollars .
and in addition to mourning the dead , the world should now think of helping the living . " we must look forward , " annan said .
taking care of children in desperate situations is the first priority of the un programs , he added . but egeland warned that if remaining pledges were not also turned into reality , victims of the dec .
26 killer waves , which left more than 157,000 people dead , would feel short-changed . " they will not forget and we should not forget , " he said . nevertheless , he added , the deadly outbreak of disease and starvation that officials had initially feared in the aftermath of the disaster did not appear to have materialized . ' humanity at its best ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami surviver asks for food from a us airforce soldier in aceh province , indonesia the conference under un auspices brought together representatives of more than 80 countries and organizations , as well as aid agencies and the stricken nations , to firm up promises and ensure better coordination of how , when and where aid is delivered . so far more than $ 8 billion has been pledged in an unprecedented worldwide display of government and public sympathy - " humanity at its very best , " egeland said . at the same time , he insisted other crises , notably in africa , must not be neglected . " it would be the ultimate disappointment for us and tragedy for the victims in all those other areas , where we are struggling to keep programs going on existing levels of assistance , were they to suffer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers load boxes of aid bound for banda aceh aid officials fear that as memories of the tsunami disaster fade , the amount actually delivered will diminish . the british charity oxfam said it was " crunch time " for the international community to ensure promises are kept . " we want guarantees that it 's new money , that it 's not money that is being diverted from another disaster or existing aid budget , " such as for sudan , a spokeswoman said . egeland said it was also a commitment he was seeking , noting that at times of disaster , " there 's a disproportion between generous pledges and the actual money delivered . " public scrutiny the un is to use a financial tracking system , consultable via the internet , to keep tabs on pledges from the moment they are made to when they are finally realized on the ground . " it will make the donors actually accountable for honoring their pledges , " egeland went on , with public scrutiny making it " very hard " for donors not to follow up . aid officials are keenly aware the donor community has often failed to live up to past promises . last year , governments found only 63 percent of the $ 3.4 million the un had asked for .
after the december 2003 quake that levelled the iranian city of bam , the un asked for $ 333 million for immediate relief .
a year later , only $ 17 million had come through . the tracing system is being set up with us auditors pricewaterhousecoopers , who will also monitor how aid is delivered to make sure there is no misuse of funds . the offer by the us company , which un officials say is free of charge , came after scathing criticism of the way the un ran its controversial iraqi oil-for-food program under the regime of former leader saddam hussein . egeland promised an immediate investigation into any claims of mishandling aid money . bildunterschrift : survivor in sri lanka before the tsunami relief meeting , egeland appealed for more cash toward an appeal launched in november for 14 other needy regions , ranging from the democratic republic of congo to chechnya and the palestinian territories . while it was relatively easy getting international aid for iraq and kosovo , it was a " nightmare " trying to meet africa 's needs , he said , although there were up to 30 million people in desperate need of assistance . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

fittingly , the exhibition venue is a stone 's throw from the artist 's former studio in berlin . a true berliner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolph von menzel menzel spent 75 years of his life in berlin and enjoyed a close affinity to the city and its surroundings like no other artist .

after his death on feb .
9 , 1905 , menzel became the first and only artist of prussia to be honored with a state funeral at the graveyard in berlin 's bergmannstrasse . his family grave is still there today as are those of architect martin gropius -lrb- 1824-1880 -rrb- , poet ludwig tieck -lrb- 1773-1853 -rrb- , historian theodor mommsen -lrb- 1817-1903 -rrb- and the philosopher friedrich scheiermacher -lrb- 1768-1834 -rrb- . prophet of the modern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting by francisco josé de goya one of the undisputed highlights of berlin 's art calendar in 2005 is a large exhibition on spanish master francisco de goya .

28 . goya -lrb- 1746-1828 -rrb- was an extraordinarily versatile artist .
he was a brilliant painter of portraits and could at the same time forcefully present the horrors of war and suffering .
his famous oil paintings include " the naked maya " and " the shooting of street fighters by the french " . end of the war in germany berlin 's german historical museum and the museum of european cultures in dahlem are dedicating special exhibitions to the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 , 1945 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soviet soldier places his nation 's flag over the reichstag , the german parliament building in berlin on april 30 , 1945 , after the germans surrendered , ending world war ii .
another show called " the war and its repercussions " at the zeughaus unter den linden also dwells on the topic through accounts by contemporary witnesses , excerpts from dairies and 400 other documents and artworks .
at the german-russian museum in karlshorst , where the german capitulation treaty was signed , a special exhibition will remember the war from a soviet perspective . nefertiti 's wandering bust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile berlin 's museum island is preparing for the move of the famous limestone bust of egyptian queen nefertiti from the egyptian museum near the charlottenburg palace to an exhibition at the kulturforum on the potsdamer platz .

the un is asking for concrete agreements , with deadlines attached . donor nations must speed up delivery of aid pledges for the asian tsunami relief effort and face public shame if they fail to live up to their promises , a top un official told a key conference in geneva on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami victim waits in line for food from unhcr aid in sri lanka jan egeland , the un emergency relief coordinator , said that of $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.6 billion -rrb- of formal aid pledges , only $ 300 million had been committed so far to projects , programs and assistance on the ground . " we need very quickly more signed contracts , more cash , more concrete commitments to help keep this massive effort going in the next six months , " he told reporters just before the geneva conference got underway . he said he expected it to produce a " large part " of the un appeal launched last week for $ 977 million for the next six months , and the rest would follow " soon . " un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped that the countries represented at the conference would collect a further billion dollars .
and in addition to mourning the dead , the world should now think of helping the living . " we must look forward , " annan said .
taking care of children in desperate situations is the first priority of the un programs , he added . but egeland warned that if remaining pledges were not also turned into reality , victims of the dec .
26 killer waves , which left more than 157,000 people dead , would feel short-changed . " they will not forget and we should not forget , " he said . nevertheless , he added , the deadly outbreak of disease and starvation that officials had initially feared in the aftermath of the disaster did not appear to have materialized . ' humanity at its best ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami surviver asks for food from a us airforce soldier in aceh province , indonesia the conference under un auspices brought together representatives of more than 80 countries and organizations , as well as aid agencies and the stricken nations , to firm up promises and ensure better coordination of how , when and where aid is delivered . so far more than $ 8 billion has been pledged in an unprecedented worldwide display of government and public sympathy - " humanity at its very best , " egeland said . at the same time , he insisted other crises , notably in africa , must not be neglected . " it would be the ultimate disappointment for us and tragedy for the victims in all those other areas , where we are struggling to keep programs going on existing levels of assistance , were they to suffer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers load boxes of aid bound for banda aceh aid officials fear that as memories of the tsunami disaster fade , the amount actually delivered will diminish . the british charity oxfam said it was " crunch time " for the international community to ensure promises are kept . " we want guarantees that it 's new money , that it 's not money that is being diverted from another disaster or existing aid budget , " such as for sudan , a spokeswoman said . egeland said it was also a commitment he was seeking , noting that at times of disaster , " there 's a disproportion between generous pledges and the actual money delivered . " public scrutiny the un is to use a financial tracking system , consultable via the internet , to keep tabs on pledges from the moment they are made to when they are finally realized on the ground . " it will make the donors actually accountable for honoring their pledges , " egeland went on , with public scrutiny making it " very hard " for donors not to follow up . aid officials are keenly aware the donor community has often failed to live up to past promises . last year , governments found only 63 percent of the $ 3.4 million the un had asked for .
after the december 2003 quake that levelled the iranian city of bam , the un asked for $ 333 million for immediate relief .
a year later , only $ 17 million had come through . the tracing system is being set up with us auditors pricewaterhousecoopers , who will also monitor how aid is delivered to make sure there is no misuse of funds . the offer by the us company , which un officials say is free of charge , came after scathing criticism of the way the un ran its controversial iraqi oil-for-food program under the regime of former leader saddam hussein . egeland promised an immediate investigation into any claims of mishandling aid money . bildunterschrift : survivor in sri lanka before the tsunami relief meeting , egeland appealed for more cash toward an appeal launched in november for 14 other needy regions , ranging from the democratic republic of congo to chechnya and the palestinian territories . while it was relatively easy getting international aid for iraq and kosovo , it was a " nightmare " trying to meet africa 's needs , he said , although there were up to 30 million people in desperate need of assistance . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

all five organisations are active in asia , africa and latin america . beyond immediate need a spokesperson for the new alliance said that while poor people are most vulnerable to the effects of a disaster such as the tsunami , assisting these people in a long-term effort could limit the consequences of a catastrophe in the future .
martin bröckelmann , head of misereor , said governments should also strive to eradicate the causes of extreme poverty and hunger in these regions when giving aid now . " in regions where wars are being waged and regimes rule that don ’ t care about the poor , the affects of the tsunami floods have been much more disastrous , " bröckelmann said .
" the poor are those who suffer most , and after catastrophes such as this , the lack of justice and equality in society becomes more apparent . " the new alliance is designed to merge the five organizations ' short-term disaster relief with long-term development aid . appeal to industrialized nations " we are an alliance of development aid organizations that all focus primarily on international justice and an end to poverty and exploitation , " said peter mucke , chief executive of terre des homes .
" the donations we receive are being spent on long-term projects in the first place , which means our support exists long before a disaster happens and continues long after it is no longer in the international spotlight . " the alliance 's representatives also urged industrialized nations not to forget their pledge made to the united nations to earmark 0.7 percent of their gdp to international development .
despite the generosity being shown by the german government and public in terms of donations for the tsunami victims , the alliance criticized the fact that germany is behind on its development promise , with just 0.28 percent of gdp currently being spent on aid . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rejects sending jobless to tsunami areas chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.01.2005 cdu battles image problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are angela merkel 's chancellor chances rising or sinking ?
germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .

germany 's conservatives are fighting an image problem with state elections looming .
internal strife seems to be high on the agenda of too many cdu politicians , and the only beneficiary is chancellor schröder . when the waters rise to the chins of german politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder seems to swim easily in the current while his opponents flounder to stay above the surface .
schröder did it during the elbe river floods just before the 2002 federal elections , and now again , he has overtrumped the opposition with his masterful handling of germany 's response to the tsunami disaster in asia .
no matter how unpopular his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- may be , schröder 's image remains , for the most part , unblemished .
and with important state elections looming , his image may just save the party .
the spd has suffered defeat after defeat in recent state polls , but citizens of two spd strongholds - schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia - will be going to the voting booths in the next four months .
should these states be ceded to the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , berlin 's center-left coalition would be very lonely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always looking good - gerhard schröder has no image problem but a weekend survey conducted by infratest showed the social democrat-green coalition in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , edging ahead of the opposition for the first time in two years .
a similar picture has been painted in schleswig-holstein .
in the national polls , the cdu garnered a significant lead over the spd in the past year , only to see that lead shrink dramatically due to the party infighting of the past few months . angela merkel lacks authority heading into an spd party meeting in weimar on monday , schröder took a shot at the cdu 's failure to stand united .
he claimed that edmund stoiber , his challenger in the 2002 election and the head of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had yet to swallow the defeat and was warming himself up for another run in 2006 .
schröder went on to say that he would have absolutely nothing against another stoiber candidacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does edmund stoiber still have aspirations to be chancellor ?
last week at a csu party meeting , one of stoiber 's leading colleagues , michael glos , again criticized cdu chairwoman and would-be chancellor candidate , angela merkel .
his remarks earned him a rap on the knuckles , but the message was clear : merkel can not line up the troops behind her .
the german media smells blood and is speculating a party coup will occur .
the business daily handelsblatt commented that the " bold experiment of entrusting a party ... to a pastor 's daughter -lrb- merkel -rrb- from the east is at risk of failing . "
tsunami aid debate hurts cdu in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster two weeks ago , schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 654 million -rrb- .
it was a seemingly large amount for a country struggling to meet budget deficit demands from the european union .
that was what the cdu thought , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- and stoiber chatting before a november press conference merkel demanded that schröder spell out exactly how the money would be spent and when .
stoiber wondered aloud on rtl television where the funds would come from .
when asked on german public television , zdf , if germany could afford to offer such a generous aid package , schröder called the debate " extremely petty-minded . "
after all , the pledged aid makes out 0.04 % of the german annual budget over a five-year period , according to the chancellor .
guido westerwelle , head of the opposition liberal democrats , sensed that the topic could burn them .
his party promised to support the tsunami aid legislation .
while the cdu may have lost points in that debate , they underlined the fact that they had first dibs on naming a chancellor candidate to run against schröder in the 2006 elections - presumably angela merkel .

all five organisations are active in asia , africa and latin america . beyond immediate need a spokesperson for the new alliance said that while poor people are most vulnerable to the effects of a disaster such as the tsunami , assisting these people in a long-term effort could limit the consequences of a catastrophe in the future .
martin bröckelmann , head of misereor , said governments should also strive to eradicate the causes of extreme poverty and hunger in these regions when giving aid now . " in regions where wars are being waged and regimes rule that don ’ t care about the poor , the affects of the tsunami floods have been much more disastrous , " bröckelmann said .
" the poor are those who suffer most , and after catastrophes such as this , the lack of justice and equality in society becomes more apparent . " the new alliance is designed to merge the five organizations ' short-term disaster relief with long-term development aid . appeal to industrialized nations " we are an alliance of development aid organizations that all focus primarily on international justice and an end to poverty and exploitation , " said peter mucke , chief executive of terre des homes .
" the donations we receive are being spent on long-term projects in the first place , which means our support exists long before a disaster happens and continues long after it is no longer in the international spotlight . " the alliance 's representatives also urged industrialized nations not to forget their pledge made to the united nations to earmark 0.7 percent of their gdp to international development .
despite the generosity being shown by the german government and public in terms of donations for the tsunami victims , the alliance criticized the fact that germany is behind on its development promise , with just 0.28 percent of gdp currently being spent on aid . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rejects sending jobless to tsunami areas chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid .

but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
during a speech in wuppertal , germany , spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- said many jews in germany are feeling insecure .
he cited greater success of the radical right-wing npd and dvu parties , increased attacks on jewish cemeteries , and worrisome comments by public officials such the catholic archbishop joachim meisner , who recently compared abortion to the holocaust . influx from the east another issue creating a stir in german political circles is jewish immigration .
berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .
it brought about a significant rise in the number of synagogues in the country , and there are now 104,000 members of the jewish community in 83 different communities around the country . when the nazis came to power , there were 503,000 jews living in germany ; in 1950 , following world war ii , that number was down to 15,000 . but the change has been far from problem-free .
many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

many of the jewish immigrants never practiced the religion in the former ussr , and there have been complaints from the jewish community in berlin - where the lion 's share of the immigrants settle - that newcomers make use of the community 's social services without actually participating in the religious aspects . in addition , some 80 percent of the immigrants from the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- , many of whom have failed to find work in the country 's depressed economy , rely on the already strained social welfare system , a recent report in the berliner zeitung newspaper claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily in reaction to this , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- recently put forth a plan to limit the immigration of ex-soviet jews , and last week the suddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that the german states had given it their approval .

but not long after the conference opened with a call for a multifaceted approach to fighting anti-semitism in europe , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , used a different venue to criticize what he perceives as a " new quality " of anti-semitism in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
during a speech in wuppertal , germany , spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- said many jews in germany are feeling insecure .
he cited greater success of the radical right-wing npd and dvu parties , increased attacks on jewish cemeteries , and worrisome comments by public officials such the catholic archbishop joachim meisner , who recently compared abortion to the holocaust . influx from the east another issue creating a stir in german political circles is jewish immigration .
berlin has proposed new laws restricting the immigration of eastern european jews , who have been moving to germany in large numbers in the past decade . each year for the past three years , more jews have immigrated to germany than to israel . the influx came as a result of an east german law , passed in 1990 right before german reunification .
the legislation allowed russian jews to enter east germany simply by proving jewish ancestry .
the law stayed in effect after germany was reunited in 1991 .
since then , 70,000 jews from the former soviet union have immigrated to germany , giving it the third-largest population of eastern european jews after israel and the united states . more jews , more synagogues in many ways , the influx was an immense boon for german jewry .

on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his death , an exhibition called " menzel and der hof " opens at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie on the museum 's island . showcasing gouache drawings , graphics and documents , the show will be the forerunner to another exhibition at the kulturforum at berlin 's potsdamer platz called " menzel and berlin - a homage " which opens on march 11 , 2005 and runs through june 5 , 2005 .
fittingly , the exhibition venue is a stone 's throw from the artist 's former studio in berlin . a true berliner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolph von menzel menzel spent 75 years of his life in berlin and enjoyed a close affinity to the city and its surroundings like no other artist .
though he was born in breslau -lrb- in current day poland -rrb- like many berliners of the time and only migrated with his family to berlin when he was 16 , menzel came to epitomize the quintessential berliner . he was made an honorary citizen of the city in his old age and was even knighted shortly after that .
after his death on feb .
9 , 1905 , menzel became the first and only artist of prussia to be honored with a state funeral at the graveyard in berlin 's bergmannstrasse . his family grave is still there today as are those of architect martin gropius -lrb- 1824-1880 -rrb- , poet ludwig tieck -lrb- 1773-1853 -rrb- , historian theodor mommsen -lrb- 1817-1903 -rrb- and the philosopher friedrich scheiermacher -lrb- 1768-1834 -rrb- . prophet of the modern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a painting by francisco josé de goya one of the undisputed highlights of berlin 's art calendar in 2005 is a large exhibition on spanish master francisco de goya .
called " goya - the prophet of the modern " , the show will be at the alte nationalgalerie from july 12 until sept .
28 . goya -lrb- 1746-1828 -rrb- was an extraordinarily versatile artist .
he was a brilliant painter of portraits and could at the same time forcefully present the horrors of war and suffering .
his famous oil paintings include " the naked maya " and " the shooting of street fighters by the french " . end of the war in germany berlin 's german historical museum and the museum of european cultures in dahlem are dedicating special exhibitions to the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 , 1945 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soviet soldier places his nation 's flag over the reichstag , the german parliament building in berlin on april 30 , 1945 , after the germans surrendered , ending world war ii .
another show called " the war and its repercussions " at the zeughaus unter den linden also dwells on the topic through accounts by contemporary witnesses , excerpts from dairies and 400 other documents and artworks .
at the german-russian museum in karlshorst , where the german capitulation treaty was signed , a special exhibition will remember the war from a soviet perspective . nefertiti 's wandering bust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile berlin 's museum island is preparing for the move of the famous limestone bust of egyptian queen nefertiti from the egyptian museum near the charlottenburg palace to an exhibition at the kulturforum on the potsdamer platz .

currently , motorists who are not charged with causing death by dangerous driving are charged with careless driving which only carries a fine .
mr lucas wants to create another offence of causing death by negligent driving , which could carry a jail term .
however , a mother whose son was killed in a road accident said his proposed new changes do not go far enough .
" if you 've killed someone , it 's a homicide . the law is wholly inadequate at the moment and there should be a manslaughter offence , " said zoe stow .
it is often difficult to establish death by dangerous driving ian lucas , wrexham mp ms stow 's 15-year-old son was killed in a road accident in 1995 .
she is now the chairman of road peace , the uk 's national charity for bereaved and injured road crash victims .
she said the driver who knocked down her child was never charged with anything .
" most of us accept road deaths and it 's only when it happens to you that you realise 90 % or more could 've been avoided , " she said .
" the courts should have a very wide perimeter for sentencing , " she added .
mr lucas , a member of the transport select committee , has been campaigning on the issue for some time and is hoping to raise the matter during the commons ' second reading of the road safety bill on tuesday .
" it is often difficult to establish death by dangerous driving and , as a consequence , relatives feel someone 's death is not recognised by a careless driving conviction , " he said .
under the former solicitor 's bill , " causing death by negligent driving would be tried in only the crown court and would be a serious offence , with a maximum penalty of seven years ' imprisonment " .

the spurt put china 's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high .
it may also increase pressure on china to relax the peg joining its currency , the yuan , with the weakening dollar .
the figures released by the ministry of commerce come as china 's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9 % in 2004 for the second year in a row .
state administration of taxation head xie xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7 % rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan -lrb- $ 311bn ; £ 165bn -rrb- .
us tensions according to the ministry of commerce , china 's exports totalled $ 63.8bn in december , taking the annual total up 35.4 % to $ 593.4bn.
with imports rising a similar amount , the deficit rose to $ 43.4bn.
the increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004 , according to mr xie .
china 's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the united states soar even further and made trade with china a sensitive political issue in washington .
the peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by us lawmakers for job losses at home .
a us report issued on tuesday on behalf of a congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003 .
the pace accelerated in the final three years of the period , said the report for the us-china economic and security review commission , moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors .
the us 's overall trade deficit with china was $ 124bn in 2003 , and is expected to rise to about $ 150bn for 2004 .

the spurt put china 's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high .

an objection against the 12m-high mast by the campaigners was rejected by the court of appeal in december .

during the hearing at the court of appeal , the judges said an inspector had concluded the risk to health was minimal from the byron avenue site and that the proposal was acceptable .

the latest study by sir william stewart says there is still no proof mobile phones are unsafe , but warns precautionary steps should be taken .
sir william said children under eight should not use mobile phones at all .
in light of the findings , a phone designed for this age group has been withdrawn from sale in the uk .
the mymo phone went on sale five months ago aimed at four to eight-year-olds to use in an emergency . "
parents have a responsibility to their children not simply to throw a mobile phone to a young child " sir william stewart q & a : mobile phone safety stewart report findings a family 's mobile experience but in a statement , the uk distributor communic8 said : " although we feel the product , if used as recommended with parental guidance , is safe , we are not experts in either the radiation or medical fields that sir william and his team are .
" simple common sense has convinced us that even the remotest possibility of our product becoming a health risk to any child is unacceptable . "
advice ignored sir william , now of the national radiological protection board , first warned five years ago that children should only use mobiles in emergencies .
but he is now concerned that advice is being ignored .
mobile phone operators welcomed the fact that sir william 's report highlighted the lack of hard evidence linking handsets with adverse health effects .
one in four seven to 10-year-olds now own a mobile phone - double the levels in 2001 , according to latest figures .
sir william 's new report , published on tuesday , warns that if mobile phones do damage health , then children will inevitably be at greatest risk .
it also calls for a review of the planning process for base stations .
sir william said he did not favour mobile phone masts being situated near schools .
he told the bbc radio four today programme there was no absolute evidence that mobile phones were a risk to health - but various studies had raised serious concerns .
youngest at most risk he said : " if there are risks - and we think that maybe there are - then the people who are going to be most affected are children , and the younger the children , the greater the danger .
" parents have a responsibility to their children not simply to throw a mobile phone to a young child , and say ' off you go ' . "
professor lawrie challis , who was vice chairman of the stewart inquiry and is now chairman of the mobile telecommunications and health research programme , set up to investigate the health risks of mobile phones , told bbc news : " i would certainly not wish my own grandchildren to use mobile phones more than they had to . "
rosie winterton , the public health minister , said government guidance stressed that mobile phones should not be over-used by young children .
" obviously there are parents who feel they want to children to have mobile phones for safety reasons , but we are quite clear that they ought to be very careful about over-use .
" there is on-going research both in the use of mobile phones and the siting of mobile phone bases . "
since the first stewart report experts have remained divided over whether the phones pose a risk .
' harmful ' last year a 750-people study by sweden 's karolinska institute suggested using a mobile phone for 10 years or more increases the risk of ear tumours by four times .
a dutch study has suggested mobile phone use can affect brain function , and further research from europe indicated radiation from the phones can cause dna damage .
have your say " there are enough real risks to children without scare mongering about imaginary ones " peter , nottingham send us your comments but dr adam burgess , a lecturer in sociology at kent university , published research a year ago dismissing claims mobile phones were harmful .
he said : " i do not know why these latest warnings are being made , they are exactly the same as was said five years ago .
" as far as i am concerned mobile phones are safe to use .
" there may be some unknown risk that could appear at some unknown date in the future but we have to balance that against the benefits of using them . "
and mike dolan , executive director of the mobile operators association , said there were good reasons why children carried mobile phones .
" families do go out there and purchase mobile phones for their children very often for very tangible security benefits .
" parents have to weigh that benefit against any possible unknown health effects in the future . "

research into the area has produced inconclusive results - although some studies have suggested there is a cause for concern .
however , most experts agree that it is sensible to limit the use of mobiles by young children .
are mobile phones safe ?
nobody really knows the answer to this question and it has been the subject of fierce debate for many years .
there is currently no definitive scientific evidence to suggest that mobile phones pose a risk to health - although some studies have raised concerns .
and since mobile phones are a relatively new technology , that situation could change .
there have been no studies into the long-term effects of using handsets , not least because the technology has not been around long enough .
what are the possible risks ?
there are fears that the electromagnetic radiation emitted from mobile phone handsets may harm health .
in particular , there have been claims that it could affect the body 's cells , brain or immune system and increase the risk of developing a range of diseases from cancer to alzheimer 's .
laboratory tests on mice have shown that radiation from mobile phones can have an adverse effect on their overall health .
it is still not clear whether those findings can be applied directly to humans .
a study by scientists in finland , published in 2002 , suggested that the electromagnetic radiation did affect human brain tissue .
but they played down their findings saying more research was needed to see if the effects were the same in living people .
another study by scientists in sweden , also published in 2002 , claimed to have found a link between analogue mobile phones and brain tumours .
it suggested users of " first generation " phones had a 30 % higher risk of developing tumours than people who did not .
however , the findings were controversial and there have been no similar studies into the effects of modern gsm phones .
there have also been reports of people suffering from headaches , fatigue and loss of concentration after using their mobile phones .
however , these claims have not been scientifically substantiated .
and in 2004 , a 750-people study by sweden 's karolinska institute found using a mobile phone for 10 years or more increases the risk of ear tumours by four times .
do some studies clear mobiles ?
yes .
these include a major 2006 study by the danish institute of cancer epidemiology of more than 420,000 mobile phone users , which found no evidence that mobile phone use was linked to an increased risk of cancer .
these findings echoed work by the institute of cancer research , also published in 2006 , which concluded that mobile phone use was not associated with a greater risk of brain cancer .
and in 2007 the idea that mobile phone masts can trigger symptoms such as anxiety , nausea and tiredness in sensitive individuals was dismissed by a study led by the university of essex .
what is the uk government 's view ?
the uk government commissioned a major study into the safety of mobile phones in the late 1990s .
the independent expert group on mobile phones published its report in 2000 .
the stewart report , named after the group 's chairman sir william stewart , concluded there was no firm evidence of health risks associated with using mobile phones .
but it warned it would be sensible not to allow young children to use them regularly - and advised all users to keep their calls as brief as possible .
in a follow-up report , published in january 2005 , sir william reiterated his concerns that if mobiles do cause damage to health , then inevitably it will be children who are most at risk .
in 2002 , the government and the mobile phone industry pledged to fund a new research programme into the safety of mobile phones to the tune of millions of pounds .
its 28 studies , being carried out by independent scientists , will aim to come up with definitive answers on mobile phone safety .
a review of the evidence , carried out by uk government scientists , suggested mobile phones do not harm health .
however , in a report published in january 2004 members of the advisory group on non-ionising radiation warned that the situation could change if new evidence emerges .
are there any risks for children ?
the stewart report recommended that children should only use mobile phones in emergencies .
the recommendation was based on the theory that children could be more at risk from the radiowaves emitted by mobile phones .
this is because their brains are still developing and their skulls are thinner , making it easier for the radiowaves to penetrate them .
also if they start using mobiles at a young age , their cumulative lifetime use will be higher than adults .
according to the advisory group on non-ionising radiation , " little has been published specifically on childhood exposures " since 2000 .
as a result , children are still advised only to use mobile phones in emergencies .
however , surveys suggest that many children are ignoring the advice .
a survey of 1,000 british children , carried out in 2001 , found 90 % of under-16s own a mobile and one in 10 spends more than 45 minutes a day using it .
do manufacturers think phones are safe ?
the mobile phone industry has spent millions of pounds investigating the safety of handsets .
it is adamant that there is no link between the use of mobile phones and any adverse human health effects .
what steps can people take to reduce any risk ?
experts suggest that mobile phone users can take a number of precautions to reduce any possible health risks .
almost all agree that the best step is to keep mobile phone conversations short and to a minimum .
many believe that so-called hands free kits reduce the risks by cutting the amount of electromagnetic radiation entering the brain .
they also recommend that users buy phones with external aerials so that it is as far away from the head as possible when in use .
similarly , it is believed that phones with a long talk time are more efficient and produce less powerful emissions .
users are also advised against buying handsets with a high " sar " value , which means it emits more radiation .

there are fears that the electromagnetic radiation emitted from mobile phone handsets may harm health .
in particular , there have been claims that it could affect the body 's cells , brain or immune system and increase the risk of developing a range of diseases from cancer to alzheimer 's .
laboratory tests on mice have shown that radiation from mobile phones can have an adverse effect on their overall health .
it is still not clear whether those findings can be applied directly to humans .
a study by scientists in finland , published in 2002 , suggested that the electromagnetic radiation did affect human brain tissue .
but they played down their findings saying more research was needed to see if the effects were the same in living people .
another study by scientists in sweden , also published in 2002 , claimed to have found a link between analogue mobile phones and brain tumours .
it suggested users of " first generation " phones had a 30 % higher risk of developing tumours than people who did not .
however , the findings were controversial and there have been no similar studies into the effects of modern gsm phones .
there have also been reports of people suffering from headaches , fatigue and loss of concentration after using their mobile phones .
however , these claims have not been scientifically substantiated .
and in 2004 , a 750-people study by sweden 's karolinska institute found using a mobile phone for 10 years or more increases the risk of ear tumours by four times .
do some studies clear mobiles ?
yes .
these include a major 2006 study by the danish institute of cancer epidemiology of more than 420,000 mobile phone users , which found no evidence that mobile phone use was linked to an increased risk of cancer .
these findings echoed work by the institute of cancer research , also published in 2006 , which concluded that mobile phone use was not associated with a greater risk of brain cancer .
and in 2007 the idea that mobile phone masts can trigger symptoms such as anxiety , nausea and tiredness in sensitive individuals was dismissed by a study led by the university of essex .
what is the uk government 's view ?
the uk government commissioned a major study into the safety of mobile phones in the late 1990s .
the independent expert group on mobile phones published its report in 2000 .
the stewart report , named after the group 's chairman sir william stewart , concluded there was no firm evidence of health risks associated with using mobile phones .
but it warned it would be sensible not to allow young children to use them regularly - and advised all users to keep their calls as brief as possible .
in a follow-up report , published in january 2005 , sir william reiterated his concerns that if mobiles do cause damage to health , then inevitably it will be children who are most at risk .
in 2002 , the government and the mobile phone industry pledged to fund a new research programme into the safety of mobile phones to the tune of millions of pounds .
its 28 studies , being carried out by independent scientists , will aim to come up with definitive answers on mobile phone safety .
a review of the evidence , carried out by uk government scientists , suggested mobile phones do not harm health .
however , in a report published in january 2004 members of the advisory group on non-ionising radiation warned that the situation could change if new evidence emerges .
are there any risks for children ?
the stewart report recommended that children should only use mobile phones in emergencies .
the recommendation was based on the theory that children could be more at risk from the radiowaves emitted by mobile phones .
this is because their brains are still developing and their skulls are thinner , making it easier for the radiowaves to penetrate them .
also if they start using mobiles at a young age , their cumulative lifetime use will be higher than adults .
according to the advisory group on non-ionising radiation , " little has been published specifically on childhood exposures " since 2000 .
as a result , children are still advised only to use mobile phones in emergencies .
however , surveys suggest that many children are ignoring the advice .
a survey of 1,000 british children , carried out in 2001 , found 90 % of under-16s own a mobile and one in 10 spends more than 45 minutes a day using it .
do manufacturers think phones are safe ?
the mobile phone industry has spent millions of pounds investigating the safety of handsets .
it is adamant that there is no link between the use of mobile phones and any adverse human health effects .
what steps can people take to reduce any risk ?
experts suggest that mobile phone users can take a number of precautions to reduce any possible health risks .
almost all agree that the best step is to keep mobile phone conversations short and to a minimum .
many believe that so-called hands free kits reduce the risks by cutting the amount of electromagnetic radiation entering the brain .
they also recommend that users buy phones with external aerials so that it is as far away from the head as possible when in use .
similarly , it is believed that phones with a long talk time are more efficient and produce less powerful emissions .
users are also advised against buying handsets with a high " sar " value , which means it emits more radiation .

the independent expert group on mobile phones published its report in 2000 .
the stewart report , named after the group 's chairman sir william stewart , concluded there was no firm evidence of health risks associated with using mobile phones .
but it warned it would be sensible not to allow young children to use them regularly - and advised all users to keep their calls as brief as possible .
in a follow-up report , published in january 2005 , sir william reiterated his concerns that if mobiles do cause damage to health , then inevitably it will be children who are most at risk .
in 2002 , the government and the mobile phone industry pledged to fund a new research programme into the safety of mobile phones to the tune of millions of pounds .
its 28 studies , being carried out by independent scientists , will aim to come up with definitive answers on mobile phone safety .
a review of the evidence , carried out by uk government scientists , suggested mobile phones do not harm health .
however , in a report published in january 2004 members of the advisory group on non-ionising radiation warned that the situation could change if new evidence emerges .
are there any risks for children ?
the stewart report recommended that children should only use mobile phones in emergencies .
the recommendation was based on the theory that children could be more at risk from the radiowaves emitted by mobile phones .
this is because their brains are still developing and their skulls are thinner , making it easier for the radiowaves to penetrate them .
also if they start using mobiles at a young age , their cumulative lifetime use will be higher than adults .
according to the advisory group on non-ionising radiation , " little has been published specifically on childhood exposures " since 2000 .
as a result , children are still advised only to use mobile phones in emergencies .
however , surveys suggest that many children are ignoring the advice .
a survey of 1,000 british children , carried out in 2001 , found 90 % of under-16s own a mobile and one in 10 spends more than 45 minutes a day using it .
do manufacturers think phones are safe ?
the mobile phone industry has spent millions of pounds investigating the safety of handsets .
it is adamant that there is no link between the use of mobile phones and any adverse human health effects .
what steps can people take to reduce any risk ?
experts suggest that mobile phone users can take a number of precautions to reduce any possible health risks .
almost all agree that the best step is to keep mobile phone conversations short and to a minimum .
many believe that so-called hands free kits reduce the risks by cutting the amount of electromagnetic radiation entering the brain .
they also recommend that users buy phones with external aerials so that it is as far away from the head as possible when in use .
similarly , it is believed that phones with a long talk time are more efficient and produce less powerful emissions .
users are also advised against buying handsets with a high " sar " value , which means it emits more radiation .

research into the area has produced inconclusive results - although some studies have suggested there is a cause for concern .
however , most experts agree that it is sensible to limit the use of mobiles by young children .
are mobile phones safe ?
nobody really knows the answer to this question and it has been the subject of fierce debate for many years .
there is currently no definitive scientific evidence to suggest that mobile phones pose a risk to health - although some studies have raised concerns .
and since mobile phones are a relatively new technology , that situation could change .
there have been no studies into the long-term effects of using handsets , not least because the technology has not been around long enough .
what are the possible risks ?
there are fears that the electromagnetic radiation emitted from mobile phone handsets may harm health .
in particular , there have been claims that it could affect the body 's cells , brain or immune system and increase the risk of developing a range of diseases from cancer to alzheimer 's .
laboratory tests on mice have shown that radiation from mobile phones can have an adverse effect on their overall health .
it is still not clear whether those findings can be applied directly to humans .
a study by scientists in finland , published in 2002 , suggested that the electromagnetic radiation did affect human brain tissue .
but they played down their findings saying more research was needed to see if the effects were the same in living people .
another study by scientists in sweden , also published in 2002 , claimed to have found a link between analogue mobile phones and brain tumours .
it suggested users of " first generation " phones had a 30 % higher risk of developing tumours than people who did not .
however , the findings were controversial and there have been no similar studies into the effects of modern gsm phones .
there have also been reports of people suffering from headaches , fatigue and loss of concentration after using their mobile phones .
however , these claims have not been scientifically substantiated .
and in 2004 , a 750-people study by sweden 's karolinska institute found using a mobile phone for 10 years or more increases the risk of ear tumours by four times .
do some studies clear mobiles ?
yes .
these include a major 2006 study by the danish institute of cancer epidemiology of more than 420,000 mobile phone users , which found no evidence that mobile phone use was linked to an increased risk of cancer .
these findings echoed work by the institute of cancer research , also published in 2006 , which concluded that mobile phone use was not associated with a greater risk of brain cancer .
and in 2007 the idea that mobile phone masts can trigger symptoms such as anxiety , nausea and tiredness in sensitive individuals was dismissed by a study led by the university of essex .

on tuesday mitsubishi , the only major japanese car firm in the red , confirmed earlier reports of negotiations .
but a spokesman refused to comment on speculation that mitsubishi could end up building cars for psa and perhaps its japanese rival nissan .
mitsubishi has been hit by a recall scandal and the withdrawal of support from shareholder daimlerchrysler .
the us-german firm , once a majority shareholder , decided last april to stop providing financial backing .
mitsubishi 's sales have slid 41 % in the past year , catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles .
mitsubishi is due to unveil a recovery plan later in january .
analysts said that alliances with other carmakers would be a necessary part of whatever it came up with , not least because its own slow sales have left its manufacturing capacity under-used .

but cumbria police chief defended his officers saying the first priority has been the preservation of life .
carlisle has been worst affected by the severe weather which hit the region at the weekend , killing three people , and the met office has forecast gusts of up to 60mph will batter carlisle until wednesday .
james rotheray who has a motor dealerships in willowholme , carlisle , said he had seen evidence of crime during the past four days .
he said : " we were greeted with youths wandering about breaking into cars on the estate .
we chased people who were trying to steal stuff out of the motorcycle clothing part of our company which has been devastated .
if people expect us to stand outside their premises at a time like this it is an unrealistic expectation chief constable michael baxter " we asked police if they could help us but were told , ' it is your premises , it 's up to you protect it , it 's not up to us , you are insured ' .
" it 's bad enough that people may go out of business without having to worry about people thieving from the premises . "
cumbria chief constable michael baxter said : " our priority throughout saturday was preservation of life and protecting property came second .
" i regret what happened to this person , it is a problem , but if people expect us to stand outside their premises at a time like this , it is an unrealistic expectation .
' fantastic help ' " every officer i had on duty and other volunteers were going house to house to make sure people 's lives were not at risk and if they were , they were being evacuated . "

thousands of people in carlisle have been moved from their homes the vasey family from holme house farm refused a helicopter flight to safety to care for their prized white charolais cattle .
giles vasey said : " we did n't have much time .
we tried to get the animals out of the barns and had fantastic help from fire brigade and friends who also got trapped here .
" but there are people in worse positions , people being killed so we are lucky .
" there were five of us upstairs with the dog .
we just had to watch as the level rose in the top barn and went up to the bull 's shoulder which was n't very nice really .
" we are calving at the moment and we were petrified - calves two days old were breathing through their noses pushed up above the water . "
meanwhile , carlisle city council is urging homeowners to dispose of ruined items at the civic amenity site at boustead grassing , and temporary disposal sites at devonshire walk and rosehill car parks .
staff from the council who collect items will have a camera with them , to photograph items for insurance purposes .
