program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.01.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc calls for npd ban increase the german government is coming under increasing pressure to renew an attempt to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
last week , ruling social democratic and green politicians demanded a new case against the party .
now christian democratic secretary-general volker kauder has said he would welcome another try to ban the neo-nazi party at the constitutional court .
at the same time , kauder attacked the center-left government of being jointly responsible for the rise of the npd .
" it 's obvious that with 4.6 or 4.7 million unemployed that the people are irritated and uncertain .
then they tend to wander to extreme parties , " said kauder on german public television zdf .
the calls for another npd trial have been met with skepticism by members from all parties .
cdu parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach said in an interview with the berliner zeitung that no matter how anti-democratic , anti-semitic and xenophobic the party may be , it must be proved that the npd has an aggressive attitude towards the state .
in march 2003 , a similar attempt to ban the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

both sides agree that the € 156 million -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- support , referred to as the solidarity pact ii , promised to rebuild the infrastructure in the east has to be used more effectively .
the demand of state premiers from the east to make the promise legally binding until 2019 has met with resistance from berlin .
up till now , only a financing of € 100 million has been guaranteed legally .
chancellor gerhard schröder warns that if the higher sum is also made binding , federal budget problems could develop .
the eastern states fear the remaining sums may never be seen without legislation .
federal transport minister manfred stolpe , who is in charge of the program to strengthen the east , reassured the state premiers from brandenburg , mecklenburg-west pommerania , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia that cuts in subsidies were not the purpose of the negotiations , rather how the funds could best be invested to benefit the economy and secure more jobs .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .
" the great question to be answered by iraq 's first free election in half a century was not who won but how many people voted , " the paper said , adding : " the answer must be - enough . " an impossible gamble " should we celebrate these elections in iraq ? " asked the french daily le monde .
" yes , without a doubt , as there have never been free elections in this country , " it replied .
but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .
" it looked like an impossible gamble , " said the paper , and yet this important step in the post-saddam democratic process " has turned out all right . " " when a nation holds its first elections after a long period of dictatorship , a temptation is to rejoice at the mere fact of its happening , " wrote britain 's the guardian , adding that such a reaction would be premature .
" in many respects it is difficult to be confident that this was a free or fair election , given the violence and intimidation surrounding it . "
nor , the paper said , do we have any idea when the " grim nightmare of violence " for iraqis will finally end . the swiss paper le temps took a similar view .
" certainly the elections do not spell the end of the problems , " it wrote , " nor do they provide a justification after the fact for what was a vile war . " but at least george w. bush and tony blair can breathe a sigh of relief , commented italy 's il messaggero .
the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .
" the great question to be answered by iraq 's first free election in half a century was not who won but how many people voted , " the paper said , adding : " the answer must be - enough . " an impossible gamble " should we celebrate these elections in iraq ? " asked the french daily le monde .
" yes , without a doubt , as there have never been free elections in this country , " it replied .
but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .
" it looked like an impossible gamble , " said the paper , and yet this important step in the post-saddam democratic process " has turned out all right . " " when a nation holds its first elections after a long period of dictatorship , a temptation is to rejoice at the mere fact of its happening , " wrote britain 's the guardian , adding that such a reaction would be premature .
" in many respects it is difficult to be confident that this was a free or fair election , given the violence and intimidation surrounding it . "
nor , the paper said , do we have any idea when the " grim nightmare of violence " for iraqis will finally end . the swiss paper le temps took a similar view .
" certainly the elections do not spell the end of the problems , " it wrote , " nor do they provide a justification after the fact for what was a vile war . " but at least george w. bush and tony blair can breathe a sigh of relief , commented italy 's il messaggero .
the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq .

their tinkering , along with floods of spam junk e-mails and phishing and spyware attacks that surreptitiously collect and pass on personal information from pcs , has caused an incalculable amount of damage .

it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .
then , it 'll be easier to see whether barroso really did sacrifice his own preferences . andreas leixnering -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso lays out aims for new commission two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact .

their tinkering , along with floods of spam junk e-mails and phishing and spyware attacks that surreptitiously collect and pass on personal information from pcs , has caused an incalculable amount of damage .
but now a german initiative made up of leading it and internet companies , experts , politicians and public institutions have decided to fight the scourge with a project called " deutschland sicher-im-netz " -lrb- germany safe on the net -rrb- . " the threats have increased , " said microsoft ceo bill gates at the launch of the initiative in munich on monday .
" even microsoft , with a research and development budget of billions ca n't cope with it . " work days lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet security is a priority for bill gates too gates said the aim was to make the internet as secure as electricity or water supplies .
the groups involved , including german software firm sap , ebay as well as the german children 's charity and the german association of municipalities , said they would work to protect users from security problems and internet criminality .
users can learn more about guarding their private spheres on the initiative 's website , which aims to boost confidence in internet security . but gates did n't get to bask in the limelight without criticism as german economics minister wolfgang clement , the initiative 's patron , sent a volley in the billionaire 's direction .
" mistakes in software development frequently allowed the attacks in the first place , " he said .
information from germany 's it security authority showed that computer viruses cost the country 's businesses 1.2 million work days each year . " that is significantly more , mr. gates , than was lost to strikes , " clement said . safety standards however , both clement and gates stressed that the problem could only be adequately dealt with if politicians and business cooperated to improve internet security .
gates called for a public-private partnership to establish safety standards .
the project 's initiators said they would develop and distribute a cd that would carry out a thorough computer security check . the initiative targets small and medium-sized firms in particular , since they are more likely to neglect security issues than large companies .
" if the small-and medium sized companies gain more trust in the internet through higher security , the entire business community profits , particularly e-business , " commented sandra schulz from the german it , telecoms and new media association bitcom . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu court upholds sanctions against microsoft a european union court on wednesday upheld penalties imposed by the eu 's executive commission against us software giant microsoft , dismissing its appeal for a suspension .

it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .
then , it 'll be easier to see whether barroso really did sacrifice his own preferences . andreas leixnering -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso lays out aims for new commission two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact .

the calls for another npd trial have been met with skepticism by members from all parties .
cdu parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach said in an interview with the berliner zeitung that no matter how anti-democratic , anti-semitic and xenophobic the party may be , it must be proved that the npd has an aggressive attitude towards the state .
in march 2003 , a similar attempt to ban the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .

their tinkering , along with floods of spam junk e-mails and phishing and spyware attacks that surreptitiously collect and pass on personal information from pcs , has caused an incalculable amount of damage .
but now a german initiative made up of leading it and internet companies , experts , politicians and public institutions have decided to fight the scourge with a project called " deutschland sicher-im-netz " -lrb- germany safe on the net -rrb- . " the threats have increased , " said microsoft ceo bill gates at the launch of the initiative in munich on monday .

users can learn more about guarding their private spheres on the initiative 's website , which aims to boost confidence in internet security . but gates did n't get to bask in the limelight without criticism as german economics minister wolfgang clement , the initiative 's patron , sent a volley in the billionaire 's direction .
" mistakes in software development frequently allowed the attacks in the first place , " he said .
information from germany 's it security authority showed that computer viruses cost the country 's businesses 1.2 million work days each year . " that is significantly more , mr. gates , than was lost to strikes , " clement said . safety standards however , both clement and gates stressed that the problem could only be adequately dealt with if politicians and business cooperated to improve internet security .
gates called for a public-private partnership to establish safety standards .
the project 's initiators said they would develop and distribute a cd that would carry out a thorough computer security check . the initiative targets small and medium-sized firms in particular , since they are more likely to neglect security issues than large companies .
" if the small-and medium sized companies gain more trust in the internet through higher security , the entire business community profits , particularly e-business , " commented sandra schulz from the german it , telecoms and new media association bitcom . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu court upholds sanctions against microsoft a european union court on wednesday upheld penalties imposed by the eu 's executive commission against us software giant microsoft , dismissing its appeal for a suspension .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc solidarity pact ii to be more effective federal and state governments are again negotiating the financing of the eastern german states .
both sides agree that the € 156 million -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- support , referred to as the solidarity pact ii , promised to rebuild the infrastructure in the east has to be used more effectively .
the demand of state premiers from the east to make the promise legally binding until 2019 has met with resistance from berlin .
up till now , only a financing of € 100 million has been guaranteed legally .
chancellor gerhard schröder warns that if the higher sum is also made binding , federal budget problems could develop .
the eastern states fear the remaining sums may never be seen without legislation .
federal transport minister manfred stolpe , who is in charge of the program to strengthen the east , reassured the state premiers from brandenburg , mecklenburg-west pommerania , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia that cuts in subsidies were not the purpose of the negotiations , rather how the funds could best be invested to benefit the economy and secure more jobs .
the federal government does not intend to dictate how the states use the money , but it no longer wants the millions to be used to cover state budget deficits .
economic data from the region in 2004 paint anything but a rosy picture . dw-world.de the east catches up a recent study of german cities confirms that the country ’ s economic powerhouses are concentrated in the west .
but among the up and coming locations are several cities in the former east .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .

werder bremen struggled past rostock as it managed to clutch one last straw to defend its title . no matter what the result , bayern munich were already assured first place before their match on sunday against hertha berlin .
munich were the benefactors of surprise defeats by schalke 04 and stuttgart on saturday but only managed a mediocre 0-0 draw before a sellout crowd at the rebuilt olympic stadium .
the result put felix magath 's side , now with 38 points , one point clear of schalke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an appeal bremen 's stadium scoreboard for the fans to be fair to the referees munich looked nervous in the first half as they tried to take undeniable control of the bundesliga but in those first 45 minutes , they had to fight to avoid falling behind .
berlin have played marvelous soccer to move up towards the top of the table and they wanted to keep that trend going .
they played fiercely in the first 15 minutes .
at one point , referee lutz wagner grabbed the center of attention by disallowing an apparent goal by nando rafael in the ninth minute .
his assistant had called it correctly from the sideline .
in the second half , bayern played with more confidence .
substitute striker paolo guerrero just missed on a header off a free kick .
a shot by owen hargreaves just went wide 10 minutes from time .
all in all , the chances on both sides were balanced .
champions werder bremen made a big jump in the standings after a hard-fought 3-2 victory over last place rostock .
they stand in fifth place with 31 points , just seven back of leaders munich .
schalke and stuttgart fall to lesser opponents schalke had a tough time playing away at fritz walter stadium and was not able to capitalize on their chances against kaiserslautern .
making good use of the home field advantage , kaiserslautern took the lead with a goal from ioannis amanatidis and then went ahead by two after stefan blank converted a penalty kick in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserlautern 's ioannis amanatidis ' -lrb- right -rrb- shot is unstoppable for schalke keeper frank rost what kaiserslautern pulled off at home , vfb stuttgart managed to give away in their game against nuremberg .
in a weak performance unworthy of their status as contenders , matthias sammer 's squad was down going into the locker room and again at the end of the game .
nuremburg opened strong with a goal from sven müller in the sixth minute and another from markus schroth just five minute later .
stuttgart fought back in the second half leveling the score at two apiece when fernando meira and imre szabics scored in the 52nd and 71st minutes .
nuremberg took the lead back in the 83rd minute when marek mintal put the ball in the back of the net , only to be followed by teammate schroth 's second goal of the game in the 85th minute .
bayer leverkusen contiune to play solid soccer .
they dominated a hapless bochum side 4-0 and moved into fourth place in the overall standings and just two points behind stuttgart .
first half goals came from leverkusen 's jacek krzynowek and andrej woronin , while it was robson ponte and former bochum player paul freier who took away any illusions bochum might have had at winning in the second half .
now bochum 's coach peter neururer 's job is in jeopardy .
hanover 96 was able to enjoy their 1-0 win over arminia bielefeld .
the goal from daniel stendel in the 30th minute kept hanover in the running for a place in the uefa cup and pushed bielefeld down one spot to 12th place .
hamburg take three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi lost this challenge and his team lost the match to nuremburg , 4-2 hamburg stayed in ninth place with their 2-1 victory over mainz .
hamburg 's sergej barberez gave his team the lead they did n't lose , though mainz was able to tie things with a benjamin auer goal just before the halftime whistle .
in the second half benjamin lauth came in off the bench to give hamburg the win in the 80th minute .
both borussia dortmund and borussia mönchengladbach could have used a three-point buffer from the relegation zone coming into the match , but had to settle with a point each in a 1-1 draw .
in a match that saw little action , jan koller 's diving header in the 29th minute gave dortmund a lead it did n't look like they would surrender as gladbach played sluggishly .
dick advocaat 's side proved to be more offensive in the second half .
peer kluge 's shot past dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller tied the game and sent both teams off the field sharing a result neither of them hoped for .
still a chance for freiburg ?
there could be light at the end of the tunnel for sc freiburg after their 1-0 win at home against slumping vfl wolfsburg .
it was substitute zlatan bajramovic who kept freiburg 's hopes alive of staying in the top league by scoring his first goal of the season in the 57th minute .
wolfsburg 's kevin hofland was too aggressive too often in the match and was sent off after receiving his second yellow card just eight minutes before the match ended . dw staff -lrb- sms / jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

last week , ruling social democratic and green politicians demanded a new case against the party .
now christian democratic secretary-general volker kauder has said he would welcome another try to ban the neo-nazi party at the constitutional court .
at the same time , kauder attacked the center-left government of being jointly responsible for the rise of the npd .
" it 's obvious that with 4.6 or 4.7 million unemployed that the people are irritated and uncertain .
then they tend to wander to extreme parties , " said kauder on german public television zdf .
the calls for another npd trial have been met with skepticism by members from all parties .
cdu parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach said in an interview with the berliner zeitung that no matter how anti-democratic , anti-semitic and xenophobic the party may be , it must be proved that the npd has an aggressive attitude towards the state .
in march 2003 , a similar attempt to ban the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

chancellor gerhard schröder spoke of an encouraging sign for the country . around the world , politicians heaped praise on the relatively peaceful elections in iraq on sunday .
in germany it was no different .
in a published statement , chancellor gerhard schröder praised the iraqi people 's resolve to determine their own future stressing that the election could lay the foundation for democracy in the war-torn country . germany would support the continuing democratization process " by word and deed . "
the strong voter turnout , the statement said , shows that iraqis had not been intimidated by violent attempts to derail the election . the german government also expressed the opinion that all of iraq ’ s ethnic and religious groups needed to be included in the ongoing political process .
this call was echoed by the opposition conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi women line up outside a polling station in the northern kurdish city of suleimaniya " my great hope is that the result of the election is a well-balanced representation of all groups , " said elmar brok , a senior christian democrat representative to the european parliament .
the strasbourg politician stressed like most people , that kurds , shiites and sunnis should be participating equally in iraq 's political process . direct support for iraq ? but the common praise of the parties ends there .
the center-left coalition in berlin has fundamentally opposed the iraq war , and in the process , has strained relations with washington .

gernot erler , foreign policy expert of the ruling social democrats , said the german government 's policy on iraq would remain unchanged after the vote . despite the success of the elections , erler believes there is no reason to change berlin 's stance and its opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" those who opposed the war are still convinced that saddam hussein could have been sidelined by the international community without resorting to military force , " erler said . reconstruction aid nonetheless , germany is planning to pump more money into the rebuilding of iraq .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is said to support proposals for an additional € 200 million in reconstruction aid to iraq which will be discussed at an eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday . despite deep divisions in the 25-nation bloc over the iraq war , there is strong agreement to support iraqi reconstruction .

werder bremen struggled past rostock as it managed to clutch one last straw to defend its title . no matter what the result , bayern munich were already assured first place before their match on sunday against hertha berlin .
munich were the benefactors of surprise defeats by schalke 04 and stuttgart on saturday but only managed a mediocre 0-0 draw before a sellout crowd at the rebuilt olympic stadium .
the result put felix magath 's side , now with 38 points , one point clear of schalke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an appeal bremen 's stadium scoreboard for the fans to be fair to the referees munich looked nervous in the first half as they tried to take undeniable control of the bundesliga but in those first 45 minutes , they had to fight to avoid falling behind .
berlin have played marvelous soccer to move up towards the top of the table and they wanted to keep that trend going .
they played fiercely in the first 15 minutes .
at one point , referee lutz wagner grabbed the center of attention by disallowing an apparent goal by nando rafael in the ninth minute .
his assistant had called it correctly from the sideline .
in the second half , bayern played with more confidence .
substitute striker paolo guerrero just missed on a header off a free kick .
a shot by owen hargreaves just went wide 10 minutes from time .
all in all , the chances on both sides were balanced .
champions werder bremen made a big jump in the standings after a hard-fought 3-2 victory over last place rostock .
they stand in fifth place with 31 points , just seven back of leaders munich .
schalke and stuttgart fall to lesser opponents schalke had a tough time playing away at fritz walter stadium and was not able to capitalize on their chances against kaiserslautern .
making good use of the home field advantage , kaiserslautern took the lead with a goal from ioannis amanatidis and then went ahead by two after stefan blank converted a penalty kick in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserlautern 's ioannis amanatidis ' -lrb- right -rrb- shot is unstoppable for schalke keeper frank rost what kaiserslautern pulled off at home , vfb stuttgart managed to give away in their game against nuremberg .
in a weak performance unworthy of their status as contenders , matthias sammer 's squad was down going into the locker room and again at the end of the game .
nuremburg opened strong with a goal from sven müller in the sixth minute and another from markus schroth just five minute later .
stuttgart fought back in the second half leveling the score at two apiece when fernando meira and imre szabics scored in the 52nd and 71st minutes .
nuremberg took the lead back in the 83rd minute when marek mintal put the ball in the back of the net , only to be followed by teammate schroth 's second goal of the game in the 85th minute .
bayer leverkusen contiune to play solid soccer .
they dominated a hapless bochum side 4-0 and moved into fourth place in the overall standings and just two points behind stuttgart .
first half goals came from leverkusen 's jacek krzynowek and andrej woronin , while it was robson ponte and former bochum player paul freier who took away any illusions bochum might have had at winning in the second half .
now bochum 's coach peter neururer 's job is in jeopardy .
hanover 96 was able to enjoy their 1-0 win over arminia bielefeld .
the goal from daniel stendel in the 30th minute kept hanover in the running for a place in the uefa cup and pushed bielefeld down one spot to 12th place .
hamburg take three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi lost this challenge and his team lost the match to nuremburg , 4-2 hamburg stayed in ninth place with their 2-1 victory over mainz .
hamburg 's sergej barberez gave his team the lead they did n't lose , though mainz was able to tie things with a benjamin auer goal just before the halftime whistle .
in the second half benjamin lauth came in off the bench to give hamburg the win in the 80th minute .
both borussia dortmund and borussia mönchengladbach could have used a three-point buffer from the relegation zone coming into the match , but had to settle with a point each in a 1-1 draw .
in a match that saw little action , jan koller 's diving header in the 29th minute gave dortmund a lead it did n't look like they would surrender as gladbach played sluggishly .
dick advocaat 's side proved to be more offensive in the second half .
peer kluge 's shot past dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller tied the game and sent both teams off the field sharing a result neither of them hoped for .
still a chance for freiburg ?
there could be light at the end of the tunnel for sc freiburg after their 1-0 win at home against slumping vfl wolfsburg .
it was substitute zlatan bajramovic who kept freiburg 's hopes alive of staying in the top league by scoring his first goal of the season in the 57th minute .
wolfsburg 's kevin hofland was too aggressive too often in the match and was sent off after receiving his second yellow card just eight minutes before the match ended . dw staff -lrb- sms / jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .

chancellor gerhard schröder spoke of an encouraging sign for the country . around the world , politicians heaped praise on the relatively peaceful elections in iraq on sunday .
in germany it was no different .
in a published statement , chancellor gerhard schröder praised the iraqi people 's resolve to determine their own future stressing that the election could lay the foundation for democracy in the war-torn country . germany would support the continuing democratization process " by word and deed . "
the strong voter turnout , the statement said , shows that iraqis had not been intimidated by violent attempts to derail the election . the german government also expressed the opinion that all of iraq ’ s ethnic and religious groups needed to be included in the ongoing political process .
this call was echoed by the opposition conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi women line up outside a polling station in the northern kurdish city of suleimaniya " my great hope is that the result of the election is a well-balanced representation of all groups , " said elmar brok , a senior christian democrat representative to the european parliament .
the strasbourg politician stressed like most people , that kurds , shiites and sunnis should be participating equally in iraq 's political process . direct support for iraq ? but the common praise of the parties ends there .
the center-left coalition in berlin has fundamentally opposed the iraq war , and in the process , has strained relations with washington .

" those who opposed the war are still convinced that saddam hussein could have been sidelined by the international community without resorting to military force , " erler said . reconstruction aid nonetheless , germany is planning to pump more money into the rebuilding of iraq .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is said to support proposals for an additional € 200 million in reconstruction aid to iraq which will be discussed at an eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday . despite deep divisions in the 25-nation bloc over the iraq war , there is strong agreement to support iraqi reconstruction .
the eu has already spent more than € 300 million mainly on improving iraqi security in the run up to sunday ’ s election . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : hope for iraq ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2005 european press review : hope for iraq ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's editors praised brave iraqis who risked their lives to vote the editorial pages of europe 's dailies on monday were dominated by reactions to the elections in iraq .
comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .
" the great question to be answered by iraq 's first free election in half a century was not who won but how many people voted , " the paper said , adding : " the answer must be - enough . " an impossible gamble " should we celebrate these elections in iraq ? " asked the french daily le monde .
" yes , without a doubt , as there have never been free elections in this country , " it replied .
but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .
" it looked like an impossible gamble , " said the paper , and yet this important step in the post-saddam democratic process " has turned out all right . " " when a nation holds its first elections after a long period of dictatorship , a temptation is to rejoice at the mere fact of its happening , " wrote britain 's the guardian , adding that such a reaction would be premature .
" in many respects it is difficult to be confident that this was a free or fair election , given the violence and intimidation surrounding it . "
nor , the paper said , do we have any idea when the " grim nightmare of violence " for iraqis will finally end . the swiss paper le temps took a similar view .
" certainly the elections do not spell the end of the problems , " it wrote , " nor do they provide a justification after the fact for what was a vile war . " but at least george w. bush and tony blair can breathe a sigh of relief , commented italy 's il messaggero .
the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq . "
the latter is the true goal of the american government , the paper said , since it has proved incapable of bringing security to iraq after its swift military victory . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de voting for iraq 's future from abroad iraqis abroad believe sunday 's election will bring change and security , even if it takes some time .

werder bremen struggled past rostock as it managed to clutch one last straw to defend its title . no matter what the result , bayern munich were already assured first place before their match on sunday against hertha berlin .
munich were the benefactors of surprise defeats by schalke 04 and stuttgart on saturday but only managed a mediocre 0-0 draw before a sellout crowd at the rebuilt olympic stadium .
the result put felix magath 's side , now with 38 points , one point clear of schalke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an appeal bremen 's stadium scoreboard for the fans to be fair to the referees munich looked nervous in the first half as they tried to take undeniable control of the bundesliga but in those first 45 minutes , they had to fight to avoid falling behind .
berlin have played marvelous soccer to move up towards the top of the table and they wanted to keep that trend going .
they played fiercely in the first 15 minutes .
at one point , referee lutz wagner grabbed the center of attention by disallowing an apparent goal by nando rafael in the ninth minute .
his assistant had called it correctly from the sideline .
in the second half , bayern played with more confidence .
substitute striker paolo guerrero just missed on a header off a free kick .
a shot by owen hargreaves just went wide 10 minutes from time .
all in all , the chances on both sides were balanced .
champions werder bremen made a big jump in the standings after a hard-fought 3-2 victory over last place rostock .
they stand in fifth place with 31 points , just seven back of leaders munich .
schalke and stuttgart fall to lesser opponents schalke had a tough time playing away at fritz walter stadium and was not able to capitalize on their chances against kaiserslautern .
making good use of the home field advantage , kaiserslautern took the lead with a goal from ioannis amanatidis and then went ahead by two after stefan blank converted a penalty kick in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserlautern 's ioannis amanatidis ' -lrb- right -rrb- shot is unstoppable for schalke keeper frank rost what kaiserslautern pulled off at home , vfb stuttgart managed to give away in their game against nuremberg .
in a weak performance unworthy of their status as contenders , matthias sammer 's squad was down going into the locker room and again at the end of the game .
nuremburg opened strong with a goal from sven müller in the sixth minute and another from markus schroth just five minute later .
stuttgart fought back in the second half leveling the score at two apiece when fernando meira and imre szabics scored in the 52nd and 71st minutes .
nuremberg took the lead back in the 83rd minute when marek mintal put the ball in the back of the net , only to be followed by teammate schroth 's second goal of the game in the 85th minute .
bayer leverkusen contiune to play solid soccer .
they dominated a hapless bochum side 4-0 and moved into fourth place in the overall standings and just two points behind stuttgart .
first half goals came from leverkusen 's jacek krzynowek and andrej woronin , while it was robson ponte and former bochum player paul freier who took away any illusions bochum might have had at winning in the second half .
now bochum 's coach peter neururer 's job is in jeopardy .
hanover 96 was able to enjoy their 1-0 win over arminia bielefeld .
the goal from daniel stendel in the 30th minute kept hanover in the running for a place in the uefa cup and pushed bielefeld down one spot to 12th place .
hamburg take three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi lost this challenge and his team lost the match to nuremburg , 4-2 hamburg stayed in ninth place with their 2-1 victory over mainz .
hamburg 's sergej barberez gave his team the lead they did n't lose , though mainz was able to tie things with a benjamin auer goal just before the halftime whistle .
in the second half benjamin lauth came in off the bench to give hamburg the win in the 80th minute .
both borussia dortmund and borussia mönchengladbach could have used a three-point buffer from the relegation zone coming into the match , but had to settle with a point each in a 1-1 draw .
in a match that saw little action , jan koller 's diving header in the 29th minute gave dortmund a lead it did n't look like they would surrender as gladbach played sluggishly .
dick advocaat 's side proved to be more offensive in the second half .
peer kluge 's shot past dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller tied the game and sent both teams off the field sharing a result neither of them hoped for .
still a chance for freiburg ?
there could be light at the end of the tunnel for sc freiburg after their 1-0 win at home against slumping vfl wolfsburg .
it was substitute zlatan bajramovic who kept freiburg 's hopes alive of staying in the top league by scoring his first goal of the season in the 57th minute .
wolfsburg 's kevin hofland was too aggressive too often in the match and was sent off after receiving his second yellow card just eight minutes before the match ended . dw staff -lrb- sms / jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .

but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 31.01.2005 mediocre munich moves clear of pack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich goalie olli kahn need n't be so unhappy - berlin did n't score on a weekend when referees demanded more attention than play on the field , munich 's nearest competitors stumbled .
werder bremen struggled past rostock as it managed to clutch one last straw to defend its title . no matter what the result , bayern munich were already assured first place before their match on sunday against hertha berlin .
munich were the benefactors of surprise defeats by schalke 04 and stuttgart on saturday but only managed a mediocre 0-0 draw before a sellout crowd at the rebuilt olympic stadium .
the result put felix magath 's side , now with 38 points , one point clear of schalke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an appeal bremen 's stadium scoreboard for the fans to be fair to the referees munich looked nervous in the first half as they tried to take undeniable control of the bundesliga but in those first 45 minutes , they had to fight to avoid falling behind .
berlin have played marvelous soccer to move up towards the top of the table and they wanted to keep that trend going .
they played fiercely in the first 15 minutes .
at one point , referee lutz wagner grabbed the center of attention by disallowing an apparent goal by nando rafael in the ninth minute .
his assistant had called it correctly from the sideline .
in the second half , bayern played with more confidence .
substitute striker paolo guerrero just missed on a header off a free kick .
a shot by owen hargreaves just went wide 10 minutes from time .
all in all , the chances on both sides were balanced .
champions werder bremen made a big jump in the standings after a hard-fought 3-2 victory over last place rostock .
they stand in fifth place with 31 points , just seven back of leaders munich .
schalke and stuttgart fall to lesser opponents schalke had a tough time playing away at fritz walter stadium and was not able to capitalize on their chances against kaiserslautern .
making good use of the home field advantage , kaiserslautern took the lead with a goal from ioannis amanatidis and then went ahead by two after stefan blank converted a penalty kick in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserlautern 's ioannis amanatidis ' -lrb- right -rrb- shot is unstoppable for schalke keeper frank rost what kaiserslautern pulled off at home , vfb stuttgart managed to give away in their game against nuremberg .
in a weak performance unworthy of their status as contenders , matthias sammer 's squad was down going into the locker room and again at the end of the game .
nuremburg opened strong with a goal from sven müller in the sixth minute and another from markus schroth just five minute later .
stuttgart fought back in the second half leveling the score at two apiece when fernando meira and imre szabics scored in the 52nd and 71st minutes .
nuremberg took the lead back in the 83rd minute when marek mintal put the ball in the back of the net , only to be followed by teammate schroth 's second goal of the game in the 85th minute .
bayer leverkusen contiune to play solid soccer .
they dominated a hapless bochum side 4-0 and moved into fourth place in the overall standings and just two points behind stuttgart .
first half goals came from leverkusen 's jacek krzynowek and andrej woronin , while it was robson ponte and former bochum player paul freier who took away any illusions bochum might have had at winning in the second half .
now bochum 's coach peter neururer 's job is in jeopardy .
hanover 96 was able to enjoy their 1-0 win over arminia bielefeld .
the goal from daniel stendel in the 30th minute kept hanover in the running for a place in the uefa cup and pushed bielefeld down one spot to 12th place .
hamburg take three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi lost this challenge and his team lost the match to nuremburg , 4-2 hamburg stayed in ninth place with their 2-1 victory over mainz .
hamburg 's sergej barberez gave his team the lead they did n't lose , though mainz was able to tie things with a benjamin auer goal just before the halftime whistle .
in the second half benjamin lauth came in off the bench to give hamburg the win in the 80th minute .
both borussia dortmund and borussia mönchengladbach could have used a three-point buffer from the relegation zone coming into the match , but had to settle with a point each in a 1-1 draw .
in a match that saw little action , jan koller 's diving header in the 29th minute gave dortmund a lead it did n't look like they would surrender as gladbach played sluggishly .
dick advocaat 's side proved to be more offensive in the second half .
peer kluge 's shot past dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller tied the game and sent both teams off the field sharing a result neither of them hoped for .
still a chance for freiburg ?
there could be light at the end of the tunnel for sc freiburg after their 1-0 win at home against slumping vfl wolfsburg .
it was substitute zlatan bajramovic who kept freiburg 's hopes alive of staying in the top league by scoring his first goal of the season in the 57th minute .
wolfsburg 's kevin hofland was too aggressive too often in the match and was sent off after receiving his second yellow card just eight minutes before the match ended . dw staff -lrb- sms / jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .
" the great question to be answered by iraq 's first free election in half a century was not who won but how many people voted , " the paper said , adding : " the answer must be - enough . " an impossible gamble " should we celebrate these elections in iraq ? " asked the french daily le monde .
" yes , without a doubt , as there have never been free elections in this country , " it replied .
but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .
" it looked like an impossible gamble , " said the paper , and yet this important step in the post-saddam democratic process " has turned out all right . " " when a nation holds its first elections after a long period of dictatorship , a temptation is to rejoice at the mere fact of its happening , " wrote britain 's the guardian , adding that such a reaction would be premature .
" in many respects it is difficult to be confident that this was a free or fair election , given the violence and intimidation surrounding it . "
nor , the paper said , do we have any idea when the " grim nightmare of violence " for iraqis will finally end . the swiss paper le temps took a similar view .
" certainly the elections do not spell the end of the problems , " it wrote , " nor do they provide a justification after the fact for what was a vile war . " but at least george w. bush and tony blair can breathe a sigh of relief , commented italy 's il messaggero .
the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq . "
the latter is the true goal of the american government , the paper said , since it has proved incapable of bringing security to iraq after its swift military victory . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de voting for iraq 's future from abroad iraqis abroad believe sunday 's election will bring change and security , even if it takes some time .

chancellor gerhard schröder spoke of an encouraging sign for the country . around the world , politicians heaped praise on the relatively peaceful elections in iraq on sunday .
in germany it was no different .
in a published statement , chancellor gerhard schröder praised the iraqi people 's resolve to determine their own future stressing that the election could lay the foundation for democracy in the war-torn country . germany would support the continuing democratization process " by word and deed . "
the strong voter turnout , the statement said , shows that iraqis had not been intimidated by violent attempts to derail the election . the german government also expressed the opinion that all of iraq ’ s ethnic and religious groups needed to be included in the ongoing political process .
this call was echoed by the opposition conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi women line up outside a polling station in the northern kurdish city of suleimaniya " my great hope is that the result of the election is a well-balanced representation of all groups , " said elmar brok , a senior christian democrat representative to the european parliament .
the strasbourg politician stressed like most people , that kurds , shiites and sunnis should be participating equally in iraq 's political process . direct support for iraq ? but the common praise of the parties ends there .
the center-left coalition in berlin has fundamentally opposed the iraq war , and in the process , has strained relations with washington .
the conservatives have long been critical of the schröder administration 's stance .
the opposition is urging berlin to do more to support the united states in their efforts to foster democracy in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the war of us president george w. bush is still a bone of contention in germany so far the german government refuses to provide assistance on the ground , but it is training iraqi police and security personnel in neighboring countries .
gernot erler , foreign policy expert of the ruling social democrats , said the german government 's policy on iraq would remain unchanged after the vote . despite the success of the elections , erler believes there is no reason to change berlin 's stance and its opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" those who opposed the war are still convinced that saddam hussein could have been sidelined by the international community without resorting to military force , " erler said . reconstruction aid nonetheless , germany is planning to pump more money into the rebuilding of iraq .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is said to support proposals for an additional € 200 million in reconstruction aid to iraq which will be discussed at an eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday . despite deep divisions in the 25-nation bloc over the iraq war , there is strong agreement to support iraqi reconstruction .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .
" the great question to be answered by iraq 's first free election in half a century was not who won but how many people voted , " the paper said , adding : " the answer must be - enough . " an impossible gamble " should we celebrate these elections in iraq ? " asked the french daily le monde .
" yes , without a doubt , as there have never been free elections in this country , " it replied .
but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .
" it looked like an impossible gamble , " said the paper , and yet this important step in the post-saddam democratic process " has turned out all right . " " when a nation holds its first elections after a long period of dictatorship , a temptation is to rejoice at the mere fact of its happening , " wrote britain 's the guardian , adding that such a reaction would be premature .
" in many respects it is difficult to be confident that this was a free or fair election , given the violence and intimidation surrounding it . "
nor , the paper said , do we have any idea when the " grim nightmare of violence " for iraqis will finally end . the swiss paper le temps took a similar view .
" certainly the elections do not spell the end of the problems , " it wrote , " nor do they provide a justification after the fact for what was a vile war . " but at least george w. bush and tony blair can breathe a sigh of relief , commented italy 's il messaggero .
the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq . "
the latter is the true goal of the american government , the paper said , since it has proved incapable of bringing security to iraq after its swift military victory . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de voting for iraq 's future from abroad iraqis abroad believe sunday 's election will bring change and security , even if it takes some time .

last week , ruling social democratic and green politicians demanded a new case against the party .
now christian democratic secretary-general volker kauder has said he would welcome another try to ban the neo-nazi party at the constitutional court .
at the same time , kauder attacked the center-left government of being jointly responsible for the rise of the npd .
" it 's obvious that with 4.6 or 4.7 million unemployed that the people are irritated and uncertain .
then they tend to wander to extreme parties , " said kauder on german public television zdf .
the calls for another npd trial have been met with skepticism by members from all parties .
cdu parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach said in an interview with the berliner zeitung that no matter how anti-democratic , anti-semitic and xenophobic the party may be , it must be proved that the npd has an aggressive attitude towards the state .
in march 2003 , a similar attempt to ban the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc solidarity pact ii to be more effective federal and state governments are again negotiating the financing of the eastern german states .
both sides agree that the € 156 million -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- support , referred to as the solidarity pact ii , promised to rebuild the infrastructure in the east has to be used more effectively .
the demand of state premiers from the east to make the promise legally binding until 2019 has met with resistance from berlin .
up till now , only a financing of € 100 million has been guaranteed legally .
chancellor gerhard schröder warns that if the higher sum is also made binding , federal budget problems could develop .
the eastern states fear the remaining sums may never be seen without legislation .
federal transport minister manfred stolpe , who is in charge of the program to strengthen the east , reassured the state premiers from brandenburg , mecklenburg-west pommerania , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia that cuts in subsidies were not the purpose of the negotiations , rather how the funds could best be invested to benefit the economy and secure more jobs .
the federal government does not intend to dictate how the states use the money , but it no longer wants the millions to be used to cover state budget deficits .
economic data from the region in 2004 paint anything but a rosy picture . dw-world.de the east catches up a recent study of german cities confirms that the country ’ s economic powerhouses are concentrated in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2005 eu suspends sanctions against cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has given cuban leader castro a break from sanctions the european union agreed monday to suspend diplomatic sanctions against cuba for at least six months , easing a standoff triggered by the jailing of dissidents in 2003 . the suspension , to be reviewed before july , was decided after fidel castro 's regime released a number of dissidents and signaled a re-opening of diplomatic contacts with eu embassies in havana . " all measures taken on june 5 , 2003 have been temporarily suspended , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , in reference to the date the sanctions were agreed . the decision will allow the resumption of high-level visits , although such trips must be used to push for improvements in human rights and the rights of dissidents in cuba . the eu froze relations with cuba following a crackdown that saw 75 dissidents jailed for terms of between six and 28 years .
three cubans found guilty of hijacking a ferry were executed .
but the standoff eased noticeably after the release of a number of the dissidents , in a move seen partly as a gesture to win over eu nations most opposed to lifting the sanctions . in addition , cuba announced in january it was restoring diplomatic ties with all eu states represented in havana , including the four most opposed to lifting the sanctions : the czech republic , the netherlands , poland and slovakia . political prisoners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn but the suspension of the sanctions is not a definitive end to the row .
asselborn -lrb- photo -rrb- said the suspension will be reviewed under the luxembourg eu presidency - which ends on june 30 - " in the light of developments and progress towards pluralism and respect of human rights in cuba . " " we highlighted the need to support a process leading to democratic pluralism , respect of human rights and basic freedoms in cuba , " he added in a break from regular eu foreign ministers ' talks in brussels .
the eu " wishes to have a constructive dialogue with the cuban authorities with a view to coming up with tangible results in economic and political matters , and in relation to human rights , " he added . according to draft conclusions from the brussels talks , the eu also " reiterates its urgent demand that cuba unconditionally release all political prisoners ... still in detention . "
a final version of the conclusions was not immediately available . human rights at issue lobby group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- insisted that the eu should make normalizing relations with cuba dependent on cuba 's meaningful progress on human rights .
" cuba 's recent release of some of the dissidents is a welcome step , but it does not signal a meaningful change in the government 's repressive policies , " said hrw americas director jose miguel vivanco in a statement . " president fidel castro is using human beings as pawns in a political game aimed at improving relations with europe , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cuba-eu relations warming up for more than a year , ties between brussels and havana were put on ice .

" all measures taken on june 5 , 2003 have been temporarily suspended , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , in reference to the date the sanctions were agreed . the decision will allow the resumption of high-level visits , although such trips must be used to push for improvements in human rights and the rights of dissidents in cuba . the eu froze relations with cuba following a crackdown that saw 75 dissidents jailed for terms of between six and 28 years .

the purchase may lead to daimler investing in a dubai-based manufacturing facility . the purchase was made through dubai international capital , the investment arm of the wholly government-owned dubai holding set up in 2004 .
dubai holding manages large-scale investment projects for the emirate , which is seeking to diversify its oil-based economy as crude reserves begin to dwindle . with the purchase of the stuttgart-based carmaker 's stock , dubai is thought to have about a 2.2 percent stake in the company .
that puts it only behind biggest shareholder deutsche bank , which had a 10.4 percent stake at the end of september , and kuwait , which owns 73.5 million shares , according to bloomberg . " we welcome dubai as a long-term investor , which shows it believes in daimlerchrysler 's potential , " a daimlerchrysler spokesman told cnn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a processing plant in jebel ali free zone in dubai several oil-rich middle eastern states have been increasing and diversifying their portfolios after record crude prices last year resulted in a windfall for them , boosting the amount of money they have to invest . change of fortune daimlerchrysler shares jumped as much as 2 percent on sunday 's announcement of the stock buy , after falling 5.3 percent in 2004 .
daimlerchrysler , which was created after daimler-benz agreed to buy us automaker chrysler in 1998 , has failed to keep pace with stocks of other car manufacturers .
daimlerchrysler investors have lost 9.9 percent annually since november 1998 , as the company has been dragged down by chrysler 's stumbling performance . but last year , chrysler 's fortunes began to turn around and in the third quarter of last year , chrysler outperformed the luxury mercedes division , leading to a profit of € 951 million -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- , compared with a loss of € 1.65 billion a year earlier . " this is a perfect time to acquire shares in daimlerchrysler as the company begins to bear the fruits of its merger with chrysler , " mohammed al gergawi , chief executive of dubai holding , told cnn . investment tit for tat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai 's modern face analysts say the deal may lead to daimlerchrysler investing in a production facility in dubai .
in 2004 , the emirate announced it was creating an industrial hub which it hopes will attract foreign and domestic investment and in the fall , daimlerchrysler 's ceo jürgen schrempp visited dubai . " it might be in exchange for daimlerchrysler establishing an industrial presence .
this may be similar to the deal in abu dhabi , where vw is going to create a production line , " walid shihabi , an analyst at the dubai-based investment bank shuaa capital , told reuters . in november 2004 , a consortium led by volkswagen bought a european vehicle leasing company for € 2 billion .
the mubadala development co . , owned by the government of abu dhabi , the capital of the united arab emirates , had a 25 percent stake in the deal . one month later , vw announced it would build an assembly line for heavy trucks in abu dhabi .

their tinkering , along with floods of spam junk e-mails and phishing and spyware attacks that surreptitiously collect and pass on personal information from pcs , has caused an incalculable amount of damage .
but now a german initiative made up of leading it and internet companies , experts , politicians and public institutions have decided to fight the scourge with a project called " deutschland sicher-im-netz " -lrb- germany safe on the net -rrb- . " the threats have increased , " said microsoft ceo bill gates at the launch of the initiative in munich on monday .
" even microsoft , with a research and development budget of billions ca n't cope with it . " work days lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet security is a priority for bill gates too gates said the aim was to make the internet as secure as electricity or water supplies .
the groups involved , including german software firm sap , ebay as well as the german children 's charity and the german association of municipalities , said they would work to protect users from security problems and internet criminality .
users can learn more about guarding their private spheres on the initiative 's website , which aims to boost confidence in internet security . but gates did n't get to bask in the limelight without criticism as german economics minister wolfgang clement , the initiative 's patron , sent a volley in the billionaire 's direction .
" mistakes in software development frequently allowed the attacks in the first place , " he said .
information from germany 's it security authority showed that computer viruses cost the country 's businesses 1.2 million work days each year . " that is significantly more , mr. gates , than was lost to strikes , " clement said . safety standards however , both clement and gates stressed that the problem could only be adequately dealt with if politicians and business cooperated to improve internet security .
gates called for a public-private partnership to establish safety standards .
the project 's initiators said they would develop and distribute a cd that would carry out a thorough computer security check . the initiative targets small and medium-sized firms in particular , since they are more likely to neglect security issues than large companies .
" if the small-and medium sized companies gain more trust in the internet through higher security , the entire business community profits , particularly e-business , " commented sandra schulz from the german it , telecoms and new media association bitcom . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu court upholds sanctions against microsoft a european union court on wednesday upheld penalties imposed by the eu 's executive commission against us software giant microsoft , dismissing its appeal for a suspension .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2005 eu commission unveils five-year strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treading carefully in parliament : jose barroso new eu commission head jose barroso has outlined his vision for the next five years .
it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .
then , it 'll be easier to see whether barroso really did sacrifice his own preferences . andreas leixnering -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso lays out aims for new commission two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact .

it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .
then , it 'll be easier to see whether barroso really did sacrifice his own preferences . andreas leixnering -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso lays out aims for new commission two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact .

it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .

koch said this would inhibit competition amongst universities .
" if we want to have competition , then it does n't make much sense to me to have a uniform tuition , " he told the newsmagazine focus .
after last week 's court ruling that tuition fees are indeed constitutional , platzeck called for fees to be the same at all universities .
he has said he will speak with fellow social democratic state premiers to develop a common plan for socially responsible tuitions that are equal everywhere .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber told the süddeutsche zeitung daily that the fees must not necessarily be introduced in fall 2005 and that bavaria would work closely with the other states to develop a system of fees . dw-world.de germany divided over tuition fees ruling reactions to the german high court 's decision to allow individual federal states to charge tuition fees have been mixed since judges declared the law banning the imposition of fees unconstitutional on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc solidarity pact ii to be more effective federal and state governments are again negotiating the financing of the eastern german states .
both sides agree that the € 156 million -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- support , referred to as the solidarity pact ii , promised to rebuild the infrastructure in the east has to be used more effectively .
the demand of state premiers from the east to make the promise legally binding until 2019 has met with resistance from berlin .
up till now , only a financing of € 100 million has been guaranteed legally .
chancellor gerhard schröder warns that if the higher sum is also made binding , federal budget problems could develop .
the eastern states fear the remaining sums may never be seen without legislation .
federal transport minister manfred stolpe , who is in charge of the program to strengthen the east , reassured the state premiers from brandenburg , mecklenburg-west pommerania , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia that cuts in subsidies were not the purpose of the negotiations , rather how the funds could best be invested to benefit the economy and secure more jobs .
the federal government does not intend to dictate how the states use the money , but it no longer wants the millions to be used to cover state budget deficits .
economic data from the region in 2004 paint anything but a rosy picture . dw-world.de the east catches up a recent study of german cities confirms that the country ’ s economic powerhouses are concentrated in the west .

both sides agree that the € 156 million -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- support , referred to as the solidarity pact ii , promised to rebuild the infrastructure in the east has to be used more effectively .
the demand of state premiers from the east to make the promise legally binding until 2019 has met with resistance from berlin .
up till now , only a financing of € 100 million has been guaranteed legally .
chancellor gerhard schröder warns that if the higher sum is also made binding , federal budget problems could develop .
the eastern states fear the remaining sums may never be seen without legislation .
federal transport minister manfred stolpe , who is in charge of the program to strengthen the east , reassured the state premiers from brandenburg , mecklenburg-west pommerania , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia that cuts in subsidies were not the purpose of the negotiations , rather how the funds could best be invested to benefit the economy and secure more jobs .
the federal government does not intend to dictate how the states use the money , but it no longer wants the millions to be used to cover state budget deficits .
economic data from the region in 2004 paint anything but a rosy picture . dw-world.de the east catches up a recent study of german cities confirms that the country ’ s economic powerhouses are concentrated in the west .
but among the up and coming locations are several cities in the former east .

werder bremen struggled past rostock as it managed to clutch one last straw to defend its title . no matter what the result , bayern munich were already assured first place before their match on sunday against hertha berlin .
munich were the benefactors of surprise defeats by schalke 04 and stuttgart on saturday but only managed a mediocre 0-0 draw before a sellout crowd at the rebuilt olympic stadium .
the result put felix magath 's side , now with 38 points , one point clear of schalke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an appeal bremen 's stadium scoreboard for the fans to be fair to the referees munich looked nervous in the first half as they tried to take undeniable control of the bundesliga but in those first 45 minutes , they had to fight to avoid falling behind .
berlin have played marvelous soccer to move up towards the top of the table and they wanted to keep that trend going .
they played fiercely in the first 15 minutes .
at one point , referee lutz wagner grabbed the center of attention by disallowing an apparent goal by nando rafael in the ninth minute .
his assistant had called it correctly from the sideline .
in the second half , bayern played with more confidence .
substitute striker paolo guerrero just missed on a header off a free kick .
a shot by owen hargreaves just went wide 10 minutes from time .
all in all , the chances on both sides were balanced .
champions werder bremen made a big jump in the standings after a hard-fought 3-2 victory over last place rostock .
they stand in fifth place with 31 points , just seven back of leaders munich .
schalke and stuttgart fall to lesser opponents schalke had a tough time playing away at fritz walter stadium and was not able to capitalize on their chances against kaiserslautern .
making good use of the home field advantage , kaiserslautern took the lead with a goal from ioannis amanatidis and then went ahead by two after stefan blank converted a penalty kick in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserlautern 's ioannis amanatidis ' -lrb- right -rrb- shot is unstoppable for schalke keeper frank rost what kaiserslautern pulled off at home , vfb stuttgart managed to give away in their game against nuremberg .
in a weak performance unworthy of their status as contenders , matthias sammer 's squad was down going into the locker room and again at the end of the game .
nuremburg opened strong with a goal from sven müller in the sixth minute and another from markus schroth just five minute later .
stuttgart fought back in the second half leveling the score at two apiece when fernando meira and imre szabics scored in the 52nd and 71st minutes .
nuremberg took the lead back in the 83rd minute when marek mintal put the ball in the back of the net , only to be followed by teammate schroth 's second goal of the game in the 85th minute .
bayer leverkusen contiune to play solid soccer .
they dominated a hapless bochum side 4-0 and moved into fourth place in the overall standings and just two points behind stuttgart .
first half goals came from leverkusen 's jacek krzynowek and andrej woronin , while it was robson ponte and former bochum player paul freier who took away any illusions bochum might have had at winning in the second half .
now bochum 's coach peter neururer 's job is in jeopardy .
hanover 96 was able to enjoy their 1-0 win over arminia bielefeld .
the goal from daniel stendel in the 30th minute kept hanover in the running for a place in the uefa cup and pushed bielefeld down one spot to 12th place .
hamburg take three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi lost this challenge and his team lost the match to nuremburg , 4-2 hamburg stayed in ninth place with their 2-1 victory over mainz .
hamburg 's sergej barberez gave his team the lead they did n't lose , though mainz was able to tie things with a benjamin auer goal just before the halftime whistle .
in the second half benjamin lauth came in off the bench to give hamburg the win in the 80th minute .
both borussia dortmund and borussia mönchengladbach could have used a three-point buffer from the relegation zone coming into the match , but had to settle with a point each in a 1-1 draw .
in a match that saw little action , jan koller 's diving header in the 29th minute gave dortmund a lead it did n't look like they would surrender as gladbach played sluggishly .
dick advocaat 's side proved to be more offensive in the second half .
peer kluge 's shot past dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller tied the game and sent both teams off the field sharing a result neither of them hoped for .
still a chance for freiburg ?
there could be light at the end of the tunnel for sc freiburg after their 1-0 win at home against slumping vfl wolfsburg .
it was substitute zlatan bajramovic who kept freiburg 's hopes alive of staying in the top league by scoring his first goal of the season in the 57th minute .
wolfsburg 's kevin hofland was too aggressive too often in the match and was sent off after receiving his second yellow card just eight minutes before the match ended . dw staff -lrb- sms / jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .

it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .
then , it 'll be easier to see whether barroso really did sacrifice his own preferences . andreas leixnering -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso lays out aims for new commission two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.01.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc calls for npd ban increase the german government is coming under increasing pressure to renew an attempt to ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
last week , ruling social democratic and green politicians demanded a new case against the party .
now christian democratic secretary-general volker kauder has said he would welcome another try to ban the neo-nazi party at the constitutional court .
at the same time , kauder attacked the center-left government of being jointly responsible for the rise of the npd .
" it 's obvious that with 4.6 or 4.7 million unemployed that the people are irritated and uncertain .
then they tend to wander to extreme parties , " said kauder on german public television zdf .
the calls for another npd trial have been met with skepticism by members from all parties .
cdu parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach said in an interview with the berliner zeitung that no matter how anti-democratic , anti-semitic and xenophobic the party may be , it must be proved that the npd has an aggressive attitude towards the state .
in march 2003 , a similar attempt to ban the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2005 european press review : hope for iraq ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's editors praised brave iraqis who risked their lives to vote the editorial pages of europe 's dailies on monday were dominated by reactions to the elections in iraq .
comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .
" the great question to be answered by iraq 's first free election in half a century was not who won but how many people voted , " the paper said , adding : " the answer must be - enough . " an impossible gamble " should we celebrate these elections in iraq ? " asked the french daily le monde .
" yes , without a doubt , as there have never been free elections in this country , " it replied .
but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .
" it looked like an impossible gamble , " said the paper , and yet this important step in the post-saddam democratic process " has turned out all right . " " when a nation holds its first elections after a long period of dictatorship , a temptation is to rejoice at the mere fact of its happening , " wrote britain 's the guardian , adding that such a reaction would be premature .
" in many respects it is difficult to be confident that this was a free or fair election , given the violence and intimidation surrounding it . "
nor , the paper said , do we have any idea when the " grim nightmare of violence " for iraqis will finally end . the swiss paper le temps took a similar view .
" certainly the elections do not spell the end of the problems , " it wrote , " nor do they provide a justification after the fact for what was a vile war . " but at least george w. bush and tony blair can breathe a sigh of relief , commented italy 's il messaggero .
the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq . "
the latter is the true goal of the american government , the paper said , since it has proved incapable of bringing security to iraq after its swift military victory . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de voting for iraq 's future from abroad iraqis abroad believe sunday 's election will bring change and security , even if it takes some time .

werder bremen struggled past rostock as it managed to clutch one last straw to defend its title . no matter what the result , bayern munich were already assured first place before their match on sunday against hertha berlin .
munich were the benefactors of surprise defeats by schalke 04 and stuttgart on saturday but only managed a mediocre 0-0 draw before a sellout crowd at the rebuilt olympic stadium .
the result put felix magath 's side , now with 38 points , one point clear of schalke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an appeal bremen 's stadium scoreboard for the fans to be fair to the referees munich looked nervous in the first half as they tried to take undeniable control of the bundesliga but in those first 45 minutes , they had to fight to avoid falling behind .
berlin have played marvelous soccer to move up towards the top of the table and they wanted to keep that trend going .
they played fiercely in the first 15 minutes .
at one point , referee lutz wagner grabbed the center of attention by disallowing an apparent goal by nando rafael in the ninth minute .
his assistant had called it correctly from the sideline .
in the second half , bayern played with more confidence .
substitute striker paolo guerrero just missed on a header off a free kick .
a shot by owen hargreaves just went wide 10 minutes from time .
all in all , the chances on both sides were balanced .
champions werder bremen made a big jump in the standings after a hard-fought 3-2 victory over last place rostock .
they stand in fifth place with 31 points , just seven back of leaders munich .
schalke and stuttgart fall to lesser opponents schalke had a tough time playing away at fritz walter stadium and was not able to capitalize on their chances against kaiserslautern .
making good use of the home field advantage , kaiserslautern took the lead with a goal from ioannis amanatidis and then went ahead by two after stefan blank converted a penalty kick in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserlautern 's ioannis amanatidis ' -lrb- right -rrb- shot is unstoppable for schalke keeper frank rost what kaiserslautern pulled off at home , vfb stuttgart managed to give away in their game against nuremberg .
in a weak performance unworthy of their status as contenders , matthias sammer 's squad was down going into the locker room and again at the end of the game .
nuremburg opened strong with a goal from sven müller in the sixth minute and another from markus schroth just five minute later .
stuttgart fought back in the second half leveling the score at two apiece when fernando meira and imre szabics scored in the 52nd and 71st minutes .
nuremberg took the lead back in the 83rd minute when marek mintal put the ball in the back of the net , only to be followed by teammate schroth 's second goal of the game in the 85th minute .
bayer leverkusen contiune to play solid soccer .
they dominated a hapless bochum side 4-0 and moved into fourth place in the overall standings and just two points behind stuttgart .
first half goals came from leverkusen 's jacek krzynowek and andrej woronin , while it was robson ponte and former bochum player paul freier who took away any illusions bochum might have had at winning in the second half .
now bochum 's coach peter neururer 's job is in jeopardy .
hanover 96 was able to enjoy their 1-0 win over arminia bielefeld .
the goal from daniel stendel in the 30th minute kept hanover in the running for a place in the uefa cup and pushed bielefeld down one spot to 12th place .
hamburg take three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's kevin kuranyi lost this challenge and his team lost the match to nuremburg , 4-2 hamburg stayed in ninth place with their 2-1 victory over mainz .
hamburg 's sergej barberez gave his team the lead they did n't lose , though mainz was able to tie things with a benjamin auer goal just before the halftime whistle .
in the second half benjamin lauth came in off the bench to give hamburg the win in the 80th minute .
both borussia dortmund and borussia mönchengladbach could have used a three-point buffer from the relegation zone coming into the match , but had to settle with a point each in a 1-1 draw .
in a match that saw little action , jan koller 's diving header in the 29th minute gave dortmund a lead it did n't look like they would surrender as gladbach played sluggishly .
dick advocaat 's side proved to be more offensive in the second half .
peer kluge 's shot past dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller tied the game and sent both teams off the field sharing a result neither of them hoped for .
still a chance for freiburg ?
there could be light at the end of the tunnel for sc freiburg after their 1-0 win at home against slumping vfl wolfsburg .
it was substitute zlatan bajramovic who kept freiburg 's hopes alive of staying in the top league by scoring his first goal of the season in the 57th minute .
wolfsburg 's kevin hofland was too aggressive too often in the match and was sent off after receiving his second yellow card just eight minutes before the match ended . dw staff -lrb- sms / jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .

" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .

the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq .

their tinkering , along with floods of spam junk e-mails and phishing and spyware attacks that surreptitiously collect and pass on personal information from pcs , has caused an incalculable amount of damage .
but now a german initiative made up of leading it and internet companies , experts , politicians and public institutions have decided to fight the scourge with a project called " deutschland sicher-im-netz " -lrb- germany safe on the net -rrb- . " the threats have increased , " said microsoft ceo bill gates at the launch of the initiative in munich on monday .
" even microsoft , with a research and development budget of billions ca n't cope with it . " work days lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet security is a priority for bill gates too gates said the aim was to make the internet as secure as electricity or water supplies .
the groups involved , including german software firm sap , ebay as well as the german children 's charity and the german association of municipalities , said they would work to protect users from security problems and internet criminality .
users can learn more about guarding their private spheres on the initiative 's website , which aims to boost confidence in internet security . but gates did n't get to bask in the limelight without criticism as german economics minister wolfgang clement , the initiative 's patron , sent a volley in the billionaire 's direction .
" mistakes in software development frequently allowed the attacks in the first place , " he said .
information from germany 's it security authority showed that computer viruses cost the country 's businesses 1.2 million work days each year . " that is significantly more , mr. gates , than was lost to strikes , " clement said . safety standards however , both clement and gates stressed that the problem could only be adequately dealt with if politicians and business cooperated to improve internet security .
gates called for a public-private partnership to establish safety standards .
the project 's initiators said they would develop and distribute a cd that would carry out a thorough computer security check . the initiative targets small and medium-sized firms in particular , since they are more likely to neglect security issues than large companies .
" if the small-and medium sized companies gain more trust in the internet through higher security , the entire business community profits , particularly e-business , " commented sandra schulz from the german it , telecoms and new media association bitcom . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu court upholds sanctions against microsoft a european union court on wednesday upheld penalties imposed by the eu 's executive commission against us software giant microsoft , dismissing its appeal for a suspension .

both sides agree that the € 156 million -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- support , referred to as the solidarity pact ii , promised to rebuild the infrastructure in the east has to be used more effectively .
the demand of state premiers from the east to make the promise legally binding until 2019 has met with resistance from berlin .
up till now , only a financing of € 100 million has been guaranteed legally .
chancellor gerhard schröder warns that if the higher sum is also made binding , federal budget problems could develop .
the eastern states fear the remaining sums may never be seen without legislation .
federal transport minister manfred stolpe , who is in charge of the program to strengthen the east , reassured the state premiers from brandenburg , mecklenburg-west pommerania , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia that cuts in subsidies were not the purpose of the negotiations , rather how the funds could best be invested to benefit the economy and secure more jobs .
the federal government does not intend to dictate how the states use the money , but it no longer wants the millions to be used to cover state budget deficits .
economic data from the region in 2004 paint anything but a rosy picture . dw-world.de the east catches up a recent study of german cities confirms that the country ’ s economic powerhouses are concentrated in the west .
but among the up and coming locations are several cities in the former east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2005 european press review : hope for iraq ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's editors praised brave iraqis who risked their lives to vote the editorial pages of europe 's dailies on monday were dominated by reactions to the elections in iraq .
comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .
" the great question to be answered by iraq 's first free election in half a century was not who won but how many people voted , " the paper said , adding : " the answer must be - enough . " an impossible gamble " should we celebrate these elections in iraq ? " asked the french daily le monde .
" yes , without a doubt , as there have never been free elections in this country , " it replied .
but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .
" it looked like an impossible gamble , " said the paper , and yet this important step in the post-saddam democratic process " has turned out all right . " " when a nation holds its first elections after a long period of dictatorship , a temptation is to rejoice at the mere fact of its happening , " wrote britain 's the guardian , adding that such a reaction would be premature .
" in many respects it is difficult to be confident that this was a free or fair election , given the violence and intimidation surrounding it . "
nor , the paper said , do we have any idea when the " grim nightmare of violence " for iraqis will finally end . the swiss paper le temps took a similar view .
" certainly the elections do not spell the end of the problems , " it wrote , " nor do they provide a justification after the fact for what was a vile war . " but at least george w. bush and tony blair can breathe a sigh of relief , commented italy 's il messaggero .
the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq . "
the latter is the true goal of the american government , the paper said , since it has proved incapable of bringing security to iraq after its swift military victory . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de voting for iraq 's future from abroad iraqis abroad believe sunday 's election will bring change and security , even if it takes some time .

it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2005 eu commission unveils five-year strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treading carefully in parliament : jose barroso new eu commission head jose barroso has outlined his vision for the next five years .
it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .
then , it 'll be easier to see whether barroso really did sacrifice his own preferences . andreas leixnering -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso lays out aims for new commission two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact .

the fact is : it now faces some major tasks in the eu , says dw 's bernd riegert .

chancellor gerhard schröder spoke of an encouraging sign for the country . around the world , politicians heaped praise on the relatively peaceful elections in iraq on sunday .
in germany it was no different .
in a published statement , chancellor gerhard schröder praised the iraqi people 's resolve to determine their own future stressing that the election could lay the foundation for democracy in the war-torn country . germany would support the continuing democratization process " by word and deed . "
the strong voter turnout , the statement said , shows that iraqis had not been intimidated by violent attempts to derail the election . the german government also expressed the opinion that all of iraq ’ s ethnic and religious groups needed to be included in the ongoing political process .
this call was echoed by the opposition conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi women line up outside a polling station in the northern kurdish city of suleimaniya " my great hope is that the result of the election is a well-balanced representation of all groups , " said elmar brok , a senior christian democrat representative to the european parliament .
the strasbourg politician stressed like most people , that kurds , shiites and sunnis should be participating equally in iraq 's political process . direct support for iraq ? but the common praise of the parties ends there .
the center-left coalition in berlin has fundamentally opposed the iraq war , and in the process , has strained relations with washington .
the conservatives have long been critical of the schröder administration 's stance .
the opposition is urging berlin to do more to support the united states in their efforts to foster democracy in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the war of us president george w. bush is still a bone of contention in germany so far the german government refuses to provide assistance on the ground , but it is training iraqi police and security personnel in neighboring countries .
gernot erler , foreign policy expert of the ruling social democrats , said the german government 's policy on iraq would remain unchanged after the vote . despite the success of the elections , erler believes there is no reason to change berlin 's stance and its opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" those who opposed the war are still convinced that saddam hussein could have been sidelined by the international community without resorting to military force , " erler said . reconstruction aid nonetheless , germany is planning to pump more money into the rebuilding of iraq .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is said to support proposals for an additional € 200 million in reconstruction aid to iraq which will be discussed at an eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday . despite deep divisions in the 25-nation bloc over the iraq war , there is strong agreement to support iraqi reconstruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2005 eu commission unveils five-year strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treading carefully in parliament : jose barroso new eu commission head jose barroso has outlined his vision for the next five years .
it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .
then , it 'll be easier to see whether barroso really did sacrifice his own preferences . andreas leixnering -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso lays out aims for new commission two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .
" the great question to be answered by iraq 's first free election in half a century was not who won but how many people voted , " the paper said , adding : " the answer must be - enough . " an impossible gamble " should we celebrate these elections in iraq ? " asked the french daily le monde .
" yes , without a doubt , as there have never been free elections in this country , " it replied .
but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .
" it looked like an impossible gamble , " said the paper , and yet this important step in the post-saddam democratic process " has turned out all right . " " when a nation holds its first elections after a long period of dictatorship , a temptation is to rejoice at the mere fact of its happening , " wrote britain 's the guardian , adding that such a reaction would be premature .
" in many respects it is difficult to be confident that this was a free or fair election , given the violence and intimidation surrounding it . "
nor , the paper said , do we have any idea when the " grim nightmare of violence " for iraqis will finally end . the swiss paper le temps took a similar view .
" certainly the elections do not spell the end of the problems , " it wrote , " nor do they provide a justification after the fact for what was a vile war . " but at least george w. bush and tony blair can breathe a sigh of relief , commented italy 's il messaggero .
the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq . "
the latter is the true goal of the american government , the paper said , since it has proved incapable of bringing security to iraq after its swift military victory . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de voting for iraq 's future from abroad iraqis abroad believe sunday 's election will bring change and security , even if it takes some time .

both sides agree that the € 156 million -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- support , referred to as the solidarity pact ii , promised to rebuild the infrastructure in the east has to be used more effectively .
the demand of state premiers from the east to make the promise legally binding until 2019 has met with resistance from berlin .
up till now , only a financing of € 100 million has been guaranteed legally .
chancellor gerhard schröder warns that if the higher sum is also made binding , federal budget problems could develop .
the eastern states fear the remaining sums may never be seen without legislation .
federal transport minister manfred stolpe , who is in charge of the program to strengthen the east , reassured the state premiers from brandenburg , mecklenburg-west pommerania , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia that cuts in subsidies were not the purpose of the negotiations , rather how the funds could best be invested to benefit the economy and secure more jobs .
the federal government does not intend to dictate how the states use the money , but it no longer wants the millions to be used to cover state budget deficits .
economic data from the region in 2004 paint anything but a rosy picture . dw-world.de the east catches up a recent study of german cities confirms that the country ’ s economic powerhouses are concentrated in the west .
but among the up and coming locations are several cities in the former east .

their tinkering , along with floods of spam junk e-mails and phishing and spyware attacks that surreptitiously collect and pass on personal information from pcs , has caused an incalculable amount of damage .
but now a german initiative made up of leading it and internet companies , experts , politicians and public institutions have decided to fight the scourge with a project called " deutschland sicher-im-netz " -lrb- germany safe on the net -rrb- . " the threats have increased , " said microsoft ceo bill gates at the launch of the initiative in munich on monday .
" even microsoft , with a research and development budget of billions ca n't cope with it . " work days lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet security is a priority for bill gates too gates said the aim was to make the internet as secure as electricity or water supplies .
the groups involved , including german software firm sap , ebay as well as the german children 's charity and the german association of municipalities , said they would work to protect users from security problems and internet criminality .
users can learn more about guarding their private spheres on the initiative 's website , which aims to boost confidence in internet security . but gates did n't get to bask in the limelight without criticism as german economics minister wolfgang clement , the initiative 's patron , sent a volley in the billionaire 's direction .
" mistakes in software development frequently allowed the attacks in the first place , " he said .
information from germany 's it security authority showed that computer viruses cost the country 's businesses 1.2 million work days each year . " that is significantly more , mr. gates , than was lost to strikes , " clement said . safety standards however , both clement and gates stressed that the problem could only be adequately dealt with if politicians and business cooperated to improve internet security .

last week , ruling social democratic and green politicians demanded a new case against the party .
now christian democratic secretary-general volker kauder has said he would welcome another try to ban the neo-nazi party at the constitutional court .
at the same time , kauder attacked the center-left government of being jointly responsible for the rise of the npd .
" it 's obvious that with 4.6 or 4.7 million unemployed that the people are irritated and uncertain .
then they tend to wander to extreme parties , " said kauder on german public television zdf .
the calls for another npd trial have been met with skepticism by members from all parties .
cdu parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach said in an interview with the berliner zeitung that no matter how anti-democratic , anti-semitic and xenophobic the party may be , it must be proved that the npd has an aggressive attitude towards the state .
in march 2003 , a similar attempt to ban the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

both sides agree that the € 156 million -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- support , referred to as the solidarity pact ii , promised to rebuild the infrastructure in the east has to be used more effectively .
the demand of state premiers from the east to make the promise legally binding until 2019 has met with resistance from berlin .
up till now , only a financing of € 100 million has been guaranteed legally .
chancellor gerhard schröder warns that if the higher sum is also made binding , federal budget problems could develop .
the eastern states fear the remaining sums may never be seen without legislation .
federal transport minister manfred stolpe , who is in charge of the program to strengthen the east , reassured the state premiers from brandenburg , mecklenburg-west pommerania , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia that cuts in subsidies were not the purpose of the negotiations , rather how the funds could best be invested to benefit the economy and secure more jobs .
the federal government does not intend to dictate how the states use the money , but it no longer wants the millions to be used to cover state budget deficits .
economic data from the region in 2004 paint anything but a rosy picture . dw-world.de the east catches up a recent study of german cities confirms that the country ’ s economic powerhouses are concentrated in the west .
but among the up and coming locations are several cities in the former east .

comments were split as to whether the vote represented a victory for democracy in the war-torn country . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung observed that the atmosphere surrounding sunday 's election alternated between a dance of joy and a dance with death .
" the corpses will be counted before the votes are counted , " the paper wrote .
" bombs in baghdad and basra , attacks and skirmishes in many parts of the country - democracy was under heavy fire . "
despite the violence , the paper noted that the rebels were unable to achieve their goal of stopping the vote , thanks to all the iraqis who risked their lives to cast their ballots . the times of london also praised the courage of iraqis taking part in the elections .
" millions of iraqis had been warned that if they went to polling stations , their blood would wash the streets .
they voted anyway , " the paper wrote .
" the great question to be answered by iraq 's first free election in half a century was not who won but how many people voted , " the paper said , adding : " the answer must be - enough . " an impossible gamble " should we celebrate these elections in iraq ? " asked the french daily le monde .
" yes , without a doubt , as there have never been free elections in this country , " it replied .
but , the paper wondered how the elections could possibly reflect the political realities of modern iraqi society , given the fact that they took place under the pressure of the occupation and the threat of terrorism . belgium 's de standaard was among those papers that deemed the election a success for taking place at all .
" it looked like an impossible gamble , " said the paper , and yet this important step in the post-saddam democratic process " has turned out all right . " " when a nation holds its first elections after a long period of dictatorship , a temptation is to rejoice at the mere fact of its happening , " wrote britain 's the guardian , adding that such a reaction would be premature .
" in many respects it is difficult to be confident that this was a free or fair election , given the violence and intimidation surrounding it . "
nor , the paper said , do we have any idea when the " grim nightmare of violence " for iraqis will finally end . the swiss paper le temps took a similar view .
" certainly the elections do not spell the end of the problems , " it wrote , " nor do they provide a justification after the fact for what was a vile war . " but at least george w. bush and tony blair can breathe a sigh of relief , commented italy 's il messaggero .
the us president in particular can be satisfied for at least three reasons , the paper wrote : with the election , he " made progress against the threat of terrorism ; proved to the world that democracy and freedom can also be created with weapons ; but most of all , paved the way for america 's exit strategy out of iraq .

werder bremen struggled past rostock as it managed to clutch one last straw to defend its title . no matter what the result , bayern munich were already assured first place before their match on sunday against hertha berlin .
munich were the benefactors of surprise defeats by schalke 04 and stuttgart on saturday but only managed a mediocre 0-0 draw before a sellout crowd at the rebuilt olympic stadium .
the result put felix magath 's side , now with 38 points , one point clear of schalke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an appeal bremen 's stadium scoreboard for the fans to be fair to the referees munich looked nervous in the first half as they tried to take undeniable control of the bundesliga but in those first 45 minutes , they had to fight to avoid falling behind .
berlin have played marvelous soccer to move up towards the top of the table and they wanted to keep that trend going .
they played fiercely in the first 15 minutes .
at one point , referee lutz wagner grabbed the center of attention by disallowing an apparent goal by nando rafael in the ninth minute .
his assistant had called it correctly from the sideline .
in the second half , bayern played with more confidence .
substitute striker paolo guerrero just missed on a header off a free kick .
a shot by owen hargreaves just went wide 10 minutes from time .
all in all , the chances on both sides were balanced .
champions werder bremen made a big jump in the standings after a hard-fought 3-2 victory over last place rostock .
they stand in fifth place with 31 points , just seven back of leaders munich .
schalke and stuttgart fall to lesser opponents schalke had a tough time playing away at fritz walter stadium and was not able to capitalize on their chances against kaiserslautern .
making good use of the home field advantage , kaiserslautern took the lead with a goal from ioannis amanatidis and then went ahead by two after stefan blank converted a penalty kick in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserlautern 's ioannis amanatidis ' -lrb- right -rrb- shot is unstoppable for schalke keeper frank rost what kaiserslautern pulled off at home , vfb stuttgart managed to give away in their game against nuremberg .
in a weak performance unworthy of their status as contenders , matthias sammer 's squad was down going into the locker room and again at the end of the game .
nuremburg opened strong with a goal from sven müller in the sixth minute and another from markus schroth just five minute later .
stuttgart fought back in the second half leveling the score at two apiece when fernando meira and imre szabics scored in the 52nd and 71st minutes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2005 eu commission unveils five-year strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treading carefully in parliament : jose barroso new eu commission head jose barroso has outlined his vision for the next five years .
it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .
then , it 'll be easier to see whether barroso really did sacrifice his own preferences . andreas leixnering -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso lays out aims for new commission two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact .

last week , ruling social democratic and green politicians demanded a new case against the party .

" it 's obvious that with 4.6 or 4.7 million unemployed that the people are irritated and uncertain .
then they tend to wander to extreme parties , " said kauder on german public television zdf .
the calls for another npd trial have been met with skepticism by members from all parties .
cdu parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach said in an interview with the berliner zeitung that no matter how anti-democratic , anti-semitic and xenophobic the party may be , it must be proved that the npd has an aggressive attitude towards the state .
in march 2003 , a similar attempt to ban the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .

now christian democratic secretary-general volker kauder has said he would welcome another try to ban the neo-nazi party at the constitutional court .
at the same time , kauder attacked the center-left government of being jointly responsible for the rise of the npd .
" it 's obvious that with 4.6 or 4.7 million unemployed that the people are irritated and uncertain .
then they tend to wander to extreme parties , " said kauder on german public television zdf .
the calls for another npd trial have been met with skepticism by members from all parties .
cdu parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach said in an interview with the berliner zeitung that no matter how anti-democratic , anti-semitic and xenophobic the party may be , it must be proved that the npd has an aggressive attitude towards the state .
in march 2003 , a similar attempt to ban the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2005 eu commission unveils five-year strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treading carefully in parliament : jose barroso new eu commission head jose barroso has outlined his vision for the next five years .
it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported . " a stupid , useless debate " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker barroso 's economic and political measures are not exactly groundbreaking .
but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .
then , it 'll be easier to see whether barroso really did sacrifice his own preferences . andreas leixnering -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso lays out aims for new commission two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.01.2005 germany united in praise for iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians agree that the elections were a victory for iraq germany 's political parties all praised the millions of iraqis who braved threats of violence to vote in sunday 's election .
chancellor gerhard schröder spoke of an encouraging sign for the country . around the world , politicians heaped praise on the relatively peaceful elections in iraq on sunday .
in germany it was no different .
in a published statement , chancellor gerhard schröder praised the iraqi people 's resolve to determine their own future stressing that the election could lay the foundation for democracy in the war-torn country . germany would support the continuing democratization process " by word and deed . "
the strong voter turnout , the statement said , shows that iraqis had not been intimidated by violent attempts to derail the election . the german government also expressed the opinion that all of iraq ’ s ethnic and religious groups needed to be included in the ongoing political process .
this call was echoed by the opposition conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi women line up outside a polling station in the northern kurdish city of suleimaniya " my great hope is that the result of the election is a well-balanced representation of all groups , " said elmar brok , a senior christian democrat representative to the european parliament .
the strasbourg politician stressed like most people , that kurds , shiites and sunnis should be participating equally in iraq 's political process . direct support for iraq ? but the common praise of the parties ends there .
the center-left coalition in berlin has fundamentally opposed the iraq war , and in the process , has strained relations with washington .
the conservatives have long been critical of the schröder administration 's stance .
the opposition is urging berlin to do more to support the united states in their efforts to foster democracy in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the war of us president george w. bush is still a bone of contention in germany so far the german government refuses to provide assistance on the ground , but it is training iraqi police and security personnel in neighboring countries .

it includes turning the eu into an economic super-power , while also ensuring environmental and social issues do n't get left behind . how do you foster more prosperity and jobs for a community of 25 nations with almost 450 million people , when growth rates differ extremely , not just from country to country , but also from region to region ?
for jose barroso , eu commission head since november 2004 , this will be the cardinal question of his five-year term in office .
the portuguese leader recently outlined his approach to this question in a speech on the commission 's strategic goals . work and wealth for europeans barroso intends to get rid of superfluous regulations and trim the fat off the eu 's notoriously bulging bureaucracy .
in future , the eu will spend at least three instead of the current 1.1 percent of gross domestic product on research and education .
europe 's labor markets will have to become more flexible .
and soon , it 's supposed to become much easier for companies to offer services across borders .
" employer-friendly europe , " is the name of the goal .
but that demands a reform process " as bold as the creation of the economic community , the launch of the euro or european expansion , " barroso said . together with the eu industry commissioner , germany 's günter verheugen , barroso intends to take key steps toward the stated goal of making the eu the most competitive economic region in the world .
the dream was formalized on paper by the european council at a special meeting in lisbon in 2000 , and it was projected that certain aims would be met by 2010 .
but in the face of an average growth rate of just two percent , the commission has since parted with the ambitious timeframe , as the financial times deutschland reported .

but the priority that he originally planned to give economic development and job creation - ahead of other issues like improving social cohesiveness and protecting the environment - was a novelty .
in mid-january , barroso and current eu president jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- clashed over the issue of priorities .
juncker called the discussion about whether competitiveness was more important than social policy and environmental projects " stupid , useless debate " - the three goals were not mutually exclusive . eu parliamentarians from the greens , social democrats and even some from the christian conservative european people 's party bloc sided with juncker .
environmental groups such as the german organization bund and greenpeace vowed to fight barroso 's order of priorities . compromises or cosmetics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : site of the debate : the eu parliament when it came time to officially present his five-year plan in the european parliament , barroso chose his words carefully .
prosperity , solidarity -lrb- which he said includes protecting the environment -rrb- and security are the most important strategic goals .
giving priority to economic issues was no longer stated so explicitly .
the toned-down program was accepted by all the fractions - with certain reservations , even by the greens . despite this , many remain sceptical as to whether barroso changed his intentions , or simply made some cosmetic touches to his rhetoric . " barroso held a well-balanced speech , in which he even took on suggestions from the left , " said jan marinus wiersma , deputy parliamentary group leader of the social democrats in the eu parliament .
" we just have to be careful now and wait to see if he keeps to his word . " the moment of truth is coming ever closer .
on wednesday this week , the eu commission will lay out a new , concrete plan of action based on the lisbon agenda .

african champions tunisia have stuttered in their campaign but 2010 world cup hosts south africa are playing well . in asia , cambodia , the philippines , bhutan and brunei darussalam did not enroll for the 2006 competition and myanmar was excluded so the 44 teams of the asian federation were reduced to 39 for qualifying .

the other six second placed teams are drawn against each other for three play-off matches , once again on a home and away basis , to determine the other three qualifiers .
these are due to be played on the november 12 and 16 , 2005 . in the south american qualifying group , ten teams fight it out home and away in a league situation similar to a reduced version of a domestic league , with the top four teams going through automatically to the finals .
the fifth placed team in the league still has a chance to qualify by beating the winner of the oceania group in a play-off match . brazil , argentina looking good for finals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldo , left , and kleberson kiss the trophy after brazil defeated germany 2-0 in the 2002 world cup final soccer match at the yokohama stadium in japan , sunday june 30 , 2002 .
for brazilians and argentines who play their domestic soccer in europe , this means a lot of traveling .
but it does n't seem to be having too much of an adverse effect on their countries ' performance .
both world champions brazil and the much-fancied argentina are placed first and second in the south american qualifying league .
incidentally , the 2006 qualifying campaign is the first in which a defending champion has to qualify .
normally , the title of world champion comes with an automatic invitation to defend that honor at the following championship . african qualification takes a rather different form .
instead of a league process , the 51 teams – normally 52 but djibouti failed to register for this world cup – are divided into two groups . nine teams advance directly to the second stage of qualification .
these are the 5 african qualifiers for the 2002 world cup in korea / japan - cameroon , nigeria , south africa , senegal and tunisia – and the 4 highest ranking african teams in the fifa world ranking published on june 25 , 2003 which were morocco , egypt , côte d ’ ivoire and congo dr. complex african group still up for grabs the other 42 teams were paired off in a draw held in paris on june 27 , 2004 and placed into a cup system to play designated opponents on a home and away basis .
the 21 winners from these games advance directly to the second stage .
the 30 teams are then split into five groups of six teams to play off in a league situation on a home and away basis .
the winners of the five groups progress to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of cameroon 's team hold up the trophy after the africa cup of nations soccer match against senegal in bamako , mali , sunday , feb .
10 , 2002 .
the balance of power in africa seems to be a very fluid thing .
the heavily-fancied malians are already out of the competition while the indominatable lions of cameroon have their work cut out to qualify in their group .
african champions tunisia have stuttered in their campaign but 2010 world cup hosts south africa are playing well . in asia , cambodia , the philippines , bhutan and brunei darussalam did not enroll for the 2006 competition and myanmar was excluded so the 44 teams of the asian federation were reduced to 39 for qualifying .
in the first phase , the 14 lowest-ranked teams classified on the basis of the fifa world ranking published on october 22 , 2003 , start off playing in a cup system on a home and away basis . asian qualification a conundrum the seven winners advance to the second stage where they join the rest of the federation teams to make up 32 teams which are split into eight groups of four to play in a league system on a home and away basis .
the eight winners of each group then advance to the third stage . two groups of four teams then play-off for the chance to go to germany .
the first- and second-placed teams in each group qualify directly while the third placed team from each group will contest a two-leg play-off on a home and away basis . in the north , central america and caribbean qualifying zone , 34 teams are split into ten groups of three teams and two groups of two teams to play in a cup system on a home and away basis .
the group winners advance to the second stage which takes on a league format with three groups of four teams . concaf group is advnaced stages the three winners and three runners-up from each group will qualify for the third stage which consists of a single group of six teams playing in a league system on a home and away basis .
the three top teams in the group will qualify for the 2006 world cup germany .
the fourth placed team can still qualify over a two-match play-off with fifth placed team from the asia zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa goalkeeper brad friedel .
the third stage is ready to begin with the usa , panama , costa rica , guatemala , mexico , and trinidad / tobago preparing to play off for the three qualification places from february 9 to october 12 . oceania has no guarantees no team from the oceania group qualifies directly for the world cup finals .
the winner of the oceania group does get the chance but must beat the fifth placed south american team to get to germany .
at the initial stage , two groups of five teams play in a league format with the winner and runner-up of each group advancing to the second stage . the second stage sees the introduction of the seeded teams , australia and new zealand , which complete a line-up of six teams in a single league group .
the winner and the runner-up advance to the third stage which consists of home and away legs to see who earns the right to meet the south american contender for a place in germany 2006 .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- what high-definition will do to dvds bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 31 january , 2005 , 08:27 gmt what high-definition will do to dvds by jo twist bbc news science and technology reporter first it was the humble home video , then it was the dvd , and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition .
high-definition gives incredible , 3d-like pictures and surround sound .
the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so , and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out .
but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds , it will profoundly change home entertainment .
for rick dean , director of business development for digital content company thx , a high-definition future is an exciting prospect .
he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy , finding nemo , the incredibles and indiana jones .
" there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds , " he told the bbc news website . "
i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting " rick dean , thx " the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined .
" the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master , " he says .
but currently , putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology can not hold as much as high-definition films demand .
" as much as you compress the picture data rate wise , you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master , " he explains .
" i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting . "
more to a disk high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to .
it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months ' time .
mr dean is confident though : " i think if they see real hd -lsb- high-definition -rsb- , not some heavily compressed version of it , there is such a remarkable difference .
" i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen . "
high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too .
on the whole , producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed .
equally , it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd .
" when we master movies right now , our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second , " says mr dean .
" our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second .
" that 's a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98 % .
so if you have anything that allows more space , you do n't have to compress so hard . "
studios could fit a lot more marketing material , games , and features , onto high-capacity dvds .
currently , an entire dvd project can take up to three months , says mr dean .
although the step of down-converting will be bypassed , this will realistically only save a day 's work , says mr dean .
one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems .
on the fairly complex star wars disks , making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone .
if studios want to cash in on the extra space , it could mean extra human hours , for which someone has to pay .
" if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks , it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required . "
and if studios do focus on delivering more " added value content " , thinks mr dean , ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it .
those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd .
but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price , studios will listen , thinks mr dean .
death star filing cabinets high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike .
more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous .
" when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i , everybody was very sun-tanned , but that was make-up .
" in the hd version of episode i , all these make-up lines showed up , " explains mr dean .
the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too .
" there are scans of a corridor -lsb- on the death star -rsb- and fairly plainly in one of those shots , there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways .
" you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just did n't see it . "
what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur .
with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas , this line blurs even further .
it could also mean that how we get films , and in what format , will widen .
" in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip -lsb- internet protocol - broadband -rsb- , giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive , " says mr dean .
but that is some time off for most , and for now , people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves .

high-definition gives incredible , 3d-like pictures and surround sound .
the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so , and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out .
but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds , it will profoundly change home entertainment .
for rick dean , director of business development for digital content company thx , a high-definition future is an exciting prospect .
he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy , finding nemo , the incredibles and indiana jones .
" there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds , " he told the bbc news website .
i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting rick dean , thx " the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined .
" the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master , " he says .
but currently , putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology can not hold as much as high-definition films demand .
" as much as you compress the picture data rate wise , you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master , " he explains .
" i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting . "
more to a disk high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to .
it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months ' time .
mr dean is confident though : " i think if they see real hd -lsb- high-definition -rsb- , not some heavily compressed version of it , there is such a remarkable difference .
" i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen . "
film or game ?
soon we might not be able to tell the difference high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too .
on the whole , producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed .
equally , it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd .
" when we master movies right now , our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second , " says mr dean .
" our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second .
" that 's a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98 % .
so if you have anything that allows more space , you do n't have to compress so hard . "
studios could fit a lot more marketing material , games , and features , onto high-capacity dvds .
currently , an entire dvd project can take up to three months , says mr dean .
although the step of down-converting will be bypassed , this will realistically only save a day 's work , says mr dean .
one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems .
on the fairly complex star wars disks , making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone .
if studios want to cash in on the extra space , it could mean extra human hours , for which someone has to pay .
" if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks , it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required . "
and if studios do focus on delivering more " added value content " , thinks mr dean , ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it .
those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd .
but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price , studios will listen , thinks mr dean .
death star filing cabinets high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike .
more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous .
" when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i , everybody was very sun-tanned , but that was make-up .
" in the hd version of episode i , all these make-up lines showed up , " explains mr dean .
the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too .
' future definition high it is ' " there are scans of a corridor -lsb- on the death star -rsb- and fairly plainly in one of those shots , there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways .
" you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just did n't see it . "
what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur .
with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas , this line blurs even further .
it could also mean that how we get films , and in what format , will widen .
" in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip -lsb- internet protocol - broadband -rsb- , giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive , " says mr dean .

" when we master movies right now , our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second , " says mr dean .
" our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second .
" that 's a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98 % .
so if you have anything that allows more space , you do n't have to compress so hard . "
studios could fit a lot more marketing material , games , and features , onto high-capacity dvds .
currently , an entire dvd project can take up to three months , says mr dean .
although the step of down-converting will be bypassed , this will realistically only save a day 's work , says mr dean .
one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems .
on the fairly complex star wars disks , making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone .
if studios want to cash in on the extra space , it could mean extra human hours , for which someone has to pay .
" if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks , it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required . "
and if studios do focus on delivering more " added value content " , thinks mr dean , ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it .
those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd .
but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price , studios will listen , thinks mr dean .
death star filing cabinets high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike .
more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous .
" when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i , everybody was very sun-tanned , but that was make-up .
" in the hd version of episode i , all these make-up lines showed up , " explains mr dean .
the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too .
' future definition high it is ' " there are scans of a corridor -lsb- on the death star -rsb- and fairly plainly in one of those shots , there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways .
" you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just did n't see it . "
what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur .
with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas , this line blurs even further .
it could also mean that how we get films , and in what format , will widen .
" in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip -lsb- internet protocol - broadband -rsb- , giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive , " says mr dean .
but that is some time off for most , and for now , people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves .

high-definition gives incredible , 3d-like pictures and surround sound .
the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so , and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out .

he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy , finding nemo , the incredibles and indiana jones .

" the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master , " he says .
but currently , putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology can not hold as much as high-definition films demand .

i have been hard at work highlighting oxfam 's make trade fair campaign .
the campaign is calling on world governments to change the rules that govern trade so that it can benefit poor countries and poor farmers and not just rich countries and big business .
we have been lucky enough to work with the sekala brothers , one of zambia 's top selling bands and passionate campaigners for trade justice .
their sensational singing , a blend of modern and traditional zambian music , drew in crowds of people to watch , dance , hear about the campaign and join the big noise - a global petition calling on world leaders to make trade fair .
unfair trade people from all over the world have joined the campaign and meeting so many different people from so many different places has been one of the highlights of my time here .
people gathered to share ideas and experiences many have their own stories to tell about how unfair trade has affected their lives .
one dairy farmer from the south of brazil told me how he was forced to sell his milk at low prices to a big european company which went on to sell it for more then eight times the price .
he said he had no choice .
he had to accept the price on offer as he had no other way of selling it .
the farmer joined the big noise petition and kept coming back during the afternoon with more and more people he had recruited to the campaign .
a different future i was also able to meet groups from across the globe to share ideas and plan activities for the global week of action for trade justice in april .
representatives of coalitions from bolivia to bangladesh , from sweden to senegal shared ideas and plans for the week which will see thousands of organisations demanding their governments , big business and international institutions such as the world trade organisation deliver trade justice .
the wsf is a unique event .
it 's a bit chaotic at times but it 's not surprising considering that an estimated 120,000 people from many different countries , speaking lots of different languages , all converge in one place .
people have gathered here to share ideas and experiences and to build partnerships and plan action for the months and years to come .
the wsf motto is " another world is possible " , and when the people gathered here return home they will be working hard to achieve it .

i have been hard at work highlighting oxfam 's make trade fair campaign .
the campaign is calling on world governments to change the rules that govern trade so that it can benefit poor countries and poor farmers and not just rich countries and big business .
we have been lucky enough to work with the sekala brothers , one of zambia 's top selling bands and passionate campaigners for trade justice .
their sensational singing , a blend of modern and traditional zambian music , drew in crowds of people to watch , dance , hear about the campaign and join the big noise - a global petition calling on world leaders to make trade fair .
unfair trade people from all over the world have joined the campaign and meeting so many different people from so many different places has been one of the highlights of my time here .
people gathered to share ideas and experiences many have their own stories to tell about how unfair trade has affected their lives .
one dairy farmer from the south of brazil told me how he was forced to sell his milk at low prices to a big european company which went on to sell it for more then eight times the price .
he said he had no choice .
he had to accept the price on offer as he had no other way of selling it .
the farmer joined the big noise petition and kept coming back during the afternoon with more and more people he had recruited to the campaign .
a different future i was also able to meet groups from across the globe to share ideas and plan activities for the global week of action for trade justice in april .
representatives of coalitions from bolivia to bangladesh , from sweden to senegal shared ideas and plans for the week which will see thousands of organisations demanding their governments , big business and international institutions such as the world trade organisation deliver trade justice .
the wsf is a unique event .
it 's a bit chaotic at times but it 's not surprising considering that an estimated 120,000 people from many different countries , speaking lots of different languages , all converge in one place .
people have gathered here to share ideas and experiences and to build partnerships and plan action for the months and years to come .
the wsf motto is " another world is possible " , and when the people gathered here return home they will be working hard to achieve it .

i got up early , went out at 10am with my family and walked to the polling station about 10 minutes from my home .
there were many people walking in the street , everyone was running around smiling and happy , it was just like a feast day .
we queued for about 10 minutes and they searched all of us , they even went through my handbag .
then i went in and voted and waited for my family to vote too .
everyone is so excited .
we heard many bombs this morning but we did n't care because we have to use our right to vote .
so many people were afraid to go this morning , but now it seems in the afternoon that more people have voted .
i am so happy , so glad .
later this afternoon we will meet up with our friends for a celebration .
we will have a meal , drink tea and eat cake .
then we will have to head back home because of the 7pm curfew .
i spoke to relatives of mine in najaf and they said people there had voted and that everything was fine .
they too were so happy .
if we are elected then i will go to my party offices in a few days and they will decide what we should do .
i wo n't find out if i have won for two or three days .
i do n't think we shall win because we did n't have many posters or people handing out our papers in the street - so very few people really knew about us .
it was just not safe to campaign .
but it does n't matter .
today is a great day .
read about zeina and the other log contributors comment on this post nobody around here voted posted by tariq al-ani law student , hit , 30 january the city is completely empty today , all you see are the us troops patrolling .
there have been some small clashes , but nothing major .
at least the water and power has been good today .
the atmosphere is very edgy - no-one can guess what 's going to happen .
i did not vote .
nobody did around here did , despite the leaflets dropped by airplanes encouraging us to do so .
last night and this morning i stayed at my relative 's home .
yesterday my wife was afraid because we could hear many vehicles going past where we were , but they did n't seem to cause any trouble and after it went quiet she managed to relax .
i did not vote for many reasons .
the most obvious is simply security - no-one went to the polling station , it was too dangerous .
also , we are not used to this .
in the past it was all propaganda , now we have a new process and people here are just not used to it .
iraqis do n't know what to do .
also the candidates ...
i admire them for having the courage to stand , but they do n't seem to have any real policies or programmes for the future .
i 've had no communication with anyone because of the curfew so i have n't spoken about it with any of my friends , although we 've watched a lot of it on tv .
i suppose tomorrow we can all sit down and talk about it .
it should be interesting !
for the future ... personally i think that half a loaf is better than none as the british would say .
we have no option at the moment here - the situation is so out of control that we must adapt to what is happening .
it may be an important day for iraq , but we 'll see .
i hope it is significant , it 's a chance to move from something unilateral - which we had for so many years - to something multilateral .
we want a legitimate government that will take care of iraq .
we want it to be an open government that creates good relationships with others and ensures our security and prosperity .
surely that is a natural right for any human being ?
read about tariq and the other log contributors comment on this post everybody at the polling station was smiling posted by louay al-tahan iraqi businessman , baghdad , 30 january we were quite worried early in the morning , so we decided to wait till things were clearer .
we kept close watch on the tv and called friends and relatives .
we heard some explosions but not as loud as they usually sound .
finally at around 11:00 local time we decided that it was safe enough to try to vote .
the polling station is about 200m from where i live in the mansoor district of baghdad , so we walked there and it was amazing .
the turnout was high .
all our neighbours and friends were there .
we were welcomed by a group of election officials , and then searched very closely .
everybody was smiling and happy , even the security people - something we are not used to here in iraq .
all the people leaving the polling station were so pleased showing off their finger marked with indelible ink .
we went in , another group of officials checked our id cards against the list of registered voters .
a ballot paper was handed to us .
we waited in line for an empty voting booth .
i made my selection along with my wife and then put them in the ballot boxes .
it was great no-one interfered or imposed their opinion on any one .
the officials were very helpful .
the helped some elderly people inside , gave general instructions on how to use the ballot papers .
when we left the station people were congratulating each other .
in all , i think it has been a great success ... as far as i can see transparent and not biased in any way .
during the whole process i did n't see any americans in the area .
afterwards we took loads of photos with friends and family .
i called friends in other parts of town to congratulate them or to encourage them to vote .
later in the afternoon , at about 1600 , it felt so safe and quite , i took my wife and two daughters for a walk .
this is something we have n't done for quite a while .
we walked by two busy polling stations .
it was amazing people we do n't know were asking us if we had voted , and congratulating us on doing so .
read about louay and the other log contributors comment on this post i voted but i missed the tennis final posted by youssef iraqi doctor , basra , 30 january well , thank god the elections went ahead without big disturbances .
we heard two explosions early this morning .
i heard later that these particular attacks caused no injuries at all .
and yes , i did manage to go and actually vote for the list i thought was the best , but i had to walk a total of 10km on foot because of the ban imposed on all cars other than police cars and ambulances .
it took me about three and a half hours to do this so i missed the last two sets of the final of the australian open tennis .
i am pleased safin won .
i 'm a great fan of his .
despite the tiresome trip , i think it was worth every step to share in this process .
there were a lot of checkpoints all through the way and we were checked with a metal detector before getting into the hall where we did the actual paper work .
it was really well organised and i think the tough security measures - as annoying as they were - contributed to the relatively high turn out .
almost everyone i know voted .
last night , just after midnight , loudspeakers of the mosques called on people not to use the tap water because it had been contaminated by saboteurs .
to tell you the truth , it caused a wave of panic throughout the city and my phone kept ringing as friends were spreading the news to each other .
then , around 02:00 this morning , police cars started patrolling the city telling everyone through loud speakers , that it was all a rumour and that there was nothing wrong with tap water .
everyone remained cautious , though , but not a single case of any sort of poisoning was registered all through basra so i guess it was just paranoia .

which is really weird posted by susan american aid worker , northern iraq , 30 january thankfully nothing bad has happened where i am today .
on friday , there were two explosions here in the evening , about 10 minutes apart .
they happened roughly the same place , not far from the city 's main market place .
the first was in a trash container , the second under a pile of sand .
four people were injured , none killed .
my friends in the city told me there was a car with baghdad number plates parked near their house .
they called police , who came and questioned the driver .
he would n't say where he was from .
after that , apparently the driver was taken into custody and tnt was found in the car .
today it has been really quiet where i am because of the traffic ban .
last night they were still allowing traffic into the main city until the late evening .
there are now lots of concrete barriers up and many roads have been blocked off .
i went out around 6pm and there were still people milling about .
from the roof of my house , through the mist , i can see one of the polling stations .
there are local armed guards stationed on the roofs around it , keeping an eye on things .
there are n't many long lines of voters .
i 'd say it was more of a steady stream .
people seem normal , certainly no-one is looking scared or running around , it 's just very quiet - which is a little weird .
if they 're not voting i guess people are mostly staying at home .
from what i can tell , speaking to local friends here , people believe that voting will help them .
they say it will still be a struggle , but the kurds in general seem positive about it .
they do n't expect miracles , in fact some are quite cynical about the choices they have on the ballot papers .
one friend told me she was voting for one of the main kurdish parties -lsb- northern alliance -rsb- because she believes this will give her people more power .
the more power the parties have the greater the chance of more independence , she told me .

some of the comments refer to previous logs : 28 january 2005 27 january 2005 26 january 2005 25 january 2005 24 january 2005 click here to read last year 's log on daily life in iraq these are some of the comments we have received so far about this log .
it was a turning point for iraq and for iraqis , i admire the brave people who went to polling stations and cast their vote for their future .
but there are a lot of things to be done by the people of iraq .
dr. najibullah , kabul , afghanistan i stayed up until 0400 to watch the iraqi vote on tv .
i was truly moved to tears when i saw the joy and pride on the iraqi faces as they voted for the first time .
the iraqi people have been through so much before and after the invasion of iraq .
so many lives have been lost and so much destruction has taken place to get to the day where the people of iraq could finally choose the type of government that they want .
it seems that we here in america take the right to vote for granted .
today is a reminder of the price that is paid to have democracy .
congratulations to the people of iraq and may god bless all of you and your country .
greg , redmond , washington , usa i whole heartedly empathize how tariq al ani is feeling as he does not know what to expect next .
yes it is true that a journey of million miles must begin with a single step but when there is so much chaos and lawlessness , it gives us very little reason to be optimistic .
we too are facing a similar situation out here as the crisis between government forces and maoist rebels deepens - though not in the scale as in iraq - and majority of the population are so much insecure about their future , so i am sure the majority of the people in iraq are feeling the same way .
to say the least all we can do is hope for the best and that 's all we have .
prashant pradhan , kathmandu , nepal .
it is wonderful to hear from iraqis ; our media filters news and it is difficult to know whether or not we are hearing the truth .
every day there are more people killed , americans and iraqis , but we hear only the body count for americans .
can someone tell me how many iraqis have died since the invasion ?
melanie faith , amherst , ma , us i honestly believe that the whole world is on the side of the iraqi people .
everyone wants to fight for you -lrb- each in their own way -rrb- .
that includes europeans , asians , africans , americans , arabs , iranians , russians , pacific islanders and whoever else you care to mention on these boards .
whether people opposed or supported the war , they honestly want to see the iraqi people win .
it 's only through your vote we will know what you want .
jamie , australia i am amazed at the courage of the iraqis who are going out to vote at this time .
here in the west we talk and vote according to our wishes .
never do we have to look over our shoulders when we express an opinion .
we have almost total security of person .
yet so many of us take these rights for granted and do not even bother to vote at election time .
here in iraq we have a people who are used only to oppression , yet they put their lives on the line to vote .
i can only applaud their bravery , and pray that a new and democratic government will bring them the happiness and security which the sacrifices of coalition troops have paid for .
clive hickson , winnipeg , canada i read an article where one iraqi described election day as " a wedding for all of iraq " .
it 's very encouraging to see so many brave the danger to exercise their rights .
i also understand those who could not put themselves in danger , in the most dangerous cities such as hit .
democracy is not supposed to be a suicide pact .
those people will have to allow their fellow citizens to start the process of representative government for them , this time .
put aside the religious differences for now , today you are all iraqis .
democracy is no respecter of religion .
congratulations on your newfound freedom .
faye , el paso , tx , usa it is sobering to think that a car with tnt could be parked outside my home .
i am glad there is a system to alert police ; it seems to work well to prevent these acts .
i only hope all those in iraq have access to communication .
the more , the better .
i know there are still mistakes made by the authorities , and hopefully in time it will be better .
i thank bbc for setting this journal up .
it is great to hear from iraqis this way , as it feels very close and personal .
good luck to all of you .
louis di meglio , brooklyn , ny usa dr youssef , i am praying for you and your family .
sometimes i believe so strongly that the american government will do what is right and fair for the brave people of iraq , while other times i truly wonder where the sense is in all of this .
how is your family ?
how are your children doing through all of this ?
what does your wife think about the elections ?
i can not even imagine what you are living through .
i admire you and the other brave citizens of iraq and i encourage you to vote .
it is your right to vote and to elect whoever you want to lead you .
once again , know that my prayers are with you and your family .
crystal young , los angeles , usa i have opposed the iraq war from the outset .
despite that , i woke up early to search the news for reports on the voter turnout and progress on voting .
it may be the first time that bush and i have hoped for the same thing .
let 's hope that the estimates of voter turnout are not overly optimistic .
but having said that , it 's hard not to feel optimism for iraq 's future and awe at the bravery of people who would risk their lives in order to vote .
i 'm also struck that the honour and courage of a people is far more effective in staring down the face of terrorism than any " war on terror " we 've been able to muster .
pat , red bank , nj usa this comment is for mr. tariq al-ani .
hi tariq and hi to your wife and children .
your description of relaxing in the desert was well-written .
i 'm here in brooklyn where the neighbour next door is scraping at the snow with his shovel !
i hope your whole family will be blessed with peace and safety and i admire you and your family for staying happy in spite of all that 's so hard for you now .
kim worthy , brooklyn , new york thanks bbc for giving un-edited voice to the people living behind the headlines .
and to everyone involved in the elections this weekend - a huge good luck .
my thoughts and prayers are with you .
kiki stevens , minneapolis , usa so many can not comprehend the threats people are facing when going to the polls .
honestly , would you send your family to vote knowing it is a life or death situation and that they would not come back tomorrow ?
i believe in the elections and have voted .
the faith of the iraqi people has been tested many times and some are prepared to sacrifice their life for the vote and a better future for their people .
husain , baghdad , iraq i think the national election in iraq is very important to the iraqi population .
i hope all areas of the country will be represented despite hardships the voters will be going through .
as i read your article today on the positive kurdish response to the election and for the high hopes they have for a new iraq it confirms my belief there is an excellent chance for iraq people to be better off tomorrow than yesterday .
i encourage everyone that is eligible to vote and then support the government that is elected .
stephen segall , united states as in my own country , south africa , we see the potential for a new , dynamic and free country of citizens who put the interests of the common good above their own separatist and racist tendencies .
as long as we can stop george bush from making pronouncements about ' crusades ' and the like , there is a chance that iraqis see this as a historic moment for themselves .
let love and peace triumph over hate , fear and despair .
andy lawrence , united arab emirates i am an iraqi living in the us .
i watch the news and i ca n't quit thinking of what 's going on in my country .
i believe that a bright future for iraq requires great efforts and sacrifices , and today , the election day , is the time to show those sacrifices by going to vote no matter what !
peace be upon everyone that is going to vote .
mohammed , western new york , usa for children of iraqi exiles , the most important events in our lives took place before we were even born .
today , on the first day of out-of-country voting , this is no longer true .
as an iraqi-american born and raised in the us , i plan to vote in the ocv program today .
i have never been to iraq , but both my parents are iraqi and it has always been the basis of my identity .
i am proud to vote and be a part of the future or iraq .
i have tremendous admiration for the election log contributors who are brave enough to risk their lives to fight a state of perpetual inconsequence .
babylonia marcus , washington , dc , usa it 's time for the rest of the world to get behind this project to get iraq back on its feet .
regardless of past disagreement on the war - what alternative is there ? ; i think its a shame that much of the passion on the issue of iraq is spent on ' disagreeing ' with america and arguing about the questionable justification of the war and not on unequivocally condemning the atrocities being committed by the insurgents .
olawande kasumu , lagos , nigeria to ian stephenson : you said north american , that would include you , since you are from canada .
blissful is not what most people have in mind when it comes to iraq .
the fact that they are able to vote is somewhat of a miracle all by itself , is n't it ?
whether it is in the middle of the " war zone " -lrb- as you put it -rrb- or not .
how many of these people are thankful they can vote at all ?
how many died for one person to vote ?
if you had been bound up for 50 years and suddenly freedom was at your door , would n't you pay the price , no matter what the cost ?
tez , st louis , mo us i 'd like to answer ian who posted earlier .
voting in the middle of a war zone is like going out in the morning to college or work place and facing the prospect of a suicide bomber in the way -lrb- frightening but has to be done .
as someone said on this site , voting is voting against violence , not particularly for a certain party or group of persons , but against intimidations by certain people .
i 'm no idealist and i sure hope to survive this period and its aftermath , but i do know that by voting i would tell those certain people that i do n't like their way of thinking and that they do n't speak for the rest of the sunnis -lrb- which i am one of .
mays , baghdad , iraq just want to say to all iraqis out there who may be reading this - good luck for this weekend !
i hope that , despite the probable violence in some areas , the election progresses iraq and you all go a little further down the road to peace , stability and a good life .
the " north american ideals " a canadian contributor derided on this page , are not just north american but global desires for peace , justice and a good life for all our families , friends and neighbours .
that 's something worth voting for !
rachelle , london , uk the elections will not be a magic bullet to fix all the problems in iraq , but it is a start whether they are dodging bullets and bombers or not .
to hear iraqi nationals who live outside the ' death triangle ' describe how they feel about the vote is optimistic , blissful , and hopeful .
the troublemakers are angry that they are losing their control , so they create havoc and murder as a form of social control through fear .
i seriously doubt the elections will be legitimate since so many are being used as pawns in the game of fear , but in the long run i have faith in the iraqi people to show the rest of the middle east how good it can be to have that rare freedom of a constitution protecting their basic human rights .

if they 're not voting i guess people are mostly staying at home .
from what i can tell , speaking to local friends here , people believe that voting will help them .
they say it will still be a struggle , but the kurds in general seem positive about it .
they do n't expect miracles , in fact some are quite cynical about the choices they have on the ballot papers .
one friend told me she was voting for one of the main kurdish parties -lsb- northern alliance -rsb- because she believes this will give her people more power .
the more power the parties have the greater the chance of more independence , she told me .

it was a turning point for iraq and for iraqis , i admire the brave people who went to polling stations and cast their vote for their future .
but there are a lot of things to be done by the people of iraq .
dr. najibullah , kabul , afghanistan i stayed up until 0400 to watch the iraqi vote on tv .
i was truly moved to tears when i saw the joy and pride on the iraqi faces as they voted for the first time .
the iraqi people have been through so much before and after the invasion of iraq .
so many lives have been lost and so much destruction has taken place to get to the day where the people of iraq could finally choose the type of government that they want .
it seems that we here in america take the right to vote for granted .
today is a reminder of the price that is paid to have democracy .
congratulations to the people of iraq and may god bless all of you and your country .
greg , redmond , washington , usa i whole heartedly empathize how tariq al ani is feeling as he does not know what to expect next .
yes it is true that a journey of million miles must begin with a single step but when there is so much chaos and lawlessness , it gives us very little reason to be optimistic .
we too are facing a similar situation out here as the crisis between government forces and maoist rebels deepens - though not in the scale as in iraq - and majority of the population are so much insecure about their future , so i am sure the majority of the people in iraq are feeling the same way .
to say the least all we can do is hope for the best and that 's all we have .
prashant pradhan , kathmandu , nepal .
it is wonderful to hear from iraqis ; our media filters news and it is difficult to know whether or not we are hearing the truth .
every day there are more people killed , americans and iraqis , but we hear only the body count for americans .
can someone tell me how many iraqis have died since the invasion ?
melanie faith , amherst , ma , us i honestly believe that the whole world is on the side of the iraqi people .
everyone wants to fight for you -lrb- each in their own way -rrb- .
that includes europeans , asians , africans , americans , arabs , iranians , russians , pacific islanders and whoever else you care to mention on these boards .
whether people opposed or supported the war , they honestly want to see the iraqi people win .
it 's only through your vote we will know what you want .
jamie , australia i am amazed at the courage of the iraqis who are going out to vote at this time .
here in the west we talk and vote according to our wishes .
never do we have to look over our shoulders when we express an opinion .
we have almost total security of person .
yet so many of us take these rights for granted and do not even bother to vote at election time .
here in iraq we have a people who are used only to oppression , yet they put their lives on the line to vote .
i can only applaud their bravery , and pray that a new and democratic government will bring them the happiness and security which the sacrifices of coalition troops have paid for .
clive hickson , winnipeg , canada i read an article where one iraqi described election day as " a wedding for all of iraq " .
it 's very encouraging to see so many brave the danger to exercise their rights .
i also understand those who could not put themselves in danger , in the most dangerous cities such as hit .
democracy is not supposed to be a suicide pact .
those people will have to allow their fellow citizens to start the process of representative government for them , this time .
put aside the religious differences for now , today you are all iraqis .
democracy is no respecter of religion .
congratulations on your newfound freedom .
faye , el paso , tx , usa it is sobering to think that a car with tnt could be parked outside my home .
i am glad there is a system to alert police ; it seems to work well to prevent these acts .
i only hope all those in iraq have access to communication .
the more , the better .
i know there are still mistakes made by the authorities , and hopefully in time it will be better .
i thank bbc for setting this journal up .
it is great to hear from iraqis this way , as it feels very close and personal .
good luck to all of you .
louis di meglio , brooklyn , ny usa dr youssef , i am praying for you and your family .
sometimes i believe so strongly that the american government will do what is right and fair for the brave people of iraq , while other times i truly wonder where the sense is in all of this .
how is your family ?
how are your children doing through all of this ?
what does your wife think about the elections ?
i can not even imagine what you are living through .
i admire you and the other brave citizens of iraq and i encourage you to vote .
it is your right to vote and to elect whoever you want to lead you .
once again , know that my prayers are with you and your family .
crystal young , los angeles , usa i have opposed the iraq war from the outset .
despite that , i woke up early to search the news for reports on the voter turnout and progress on voting .
it may be the first time that bush and i have hoped for the same thing .
let 's hope that the estimates of voter turnout are not overly optimistic .
but having said that , it 's hard not to feel optimism for iraq 's future and awe at the bravery of people who would risk their lives in order to vote .
i 'm also struck that the honour and courage of a people is far more effective in staring down the face of terrorism than any " war on terror " we 've been able to muster .
pat , red bank , nj usa this comment is for mr. tariq al-ani .
hi tariq and hi to your wife and children .
your description of relaxing in the desert was well-written .
i 'm here in brooklyn where the neighbour next door is scraping at the snow with his shovel !
i hope your whole family will be blessed with peace and safety and i admire you and your family for staying happy in spite of all that 's so hard for you now .
kim worthy , brooklyn , new york thanks bbc for giving un-edited voice to the people living behind the headlines .
and to everyone involved in the elections this weekend - a huge good luck .
my thoughts and prayers are with you .
kiki stevens , minneapolis , usa so many can not comprehend the threats people are facing when going to the polls .
honestly , would you send your family to vote knowing it is a life or death situation and that they would not come back tomorrow ?
i believe in the elections and have voted .
the faith of the iraqi people has been tested many times and some are prepared to sacrifice their life for the vote and a better future for their people .
husain , baghdad , iraq i think the national election in iraq is very important to the iraqi population .
i hope all areas of the country will be represented despite hardships the voters will be going through .
as i read your article today on the positive kurdish response to the election and for the high hopes they have for a new iraq it confirms my belief there is an excellent chance for iraq people to be better off tomorrow than yesterday .
i encourage everyone that is eligible to vote and then support the government that is elected .
stephen segall , united states as in my own country , south africa , we see the potential for a new , dynamic and free country of citizens who put the interests of the common good above their own separatist and racist tendencies .
as long as we can stop george bush from making pronouncements about ' crusades ' and the like , there is a chance that iraqis see this as a historic moment for themselves .
let love and peace triumph over hate , fear and despair .
andy lawrence , united arab emirates i am an iraqi living in the us .
i watch the news and i ca n't quit thinking of what 's going on in my country .
i believe that a bright future for iraq requires great efforts and sacrifices , and today , the election day , is the time to show those sacrifices by going to vote no matter what !
peace be upon everyone that is going to vote .
mohammed , western new york , usa for children of iraqi exiles , the most important events in our lives took place before we were even born .
today , on the first day of out-of-country voting , this is no longer true .
as an iraqi-american born and raised in the us , i plan to vote in the ocv program today .
i have never been to iraq , but both my parents are iraqi and it has always been the basis of my identity .
i am proud to vote and be a part of the future or iraq .
i have tremendous admiration for the election log contributors who are brave enough to risk their lives to fight a state of perpetual inconsequence .
babylonia marcus , washington , dc , usa it 's time for the rest of the world to get behind this project to get iraq back on its feet .
regardless of past disagreement on the war - what alternative is there ? ; i think its a shame that much of the passion on the issue of iraq is spent on ' disagreeing ' with america and arguing about the questionable justification of the war and not on unequivocally condemning the atrocities being committed by the insurgents .
olawande kasumu , lagos , nigeria to ian stephenson : you said north american , that would include you , since you are from canada .
blissful is not what most people have in mind when it comes to iraq .
the fact that they are able to vote is somewhat of a miracle all by itself , is n't it ?
whether it is in the middle of the " war zone " -lrb- as you put it -rrb- or not .
how many of these people are thankful they can vote at all ?
how many died for one person to vote ?
if you had been bound up for 50 years and suddenly freedom was at your door , would n't you pay the price , no matter what the cost ?
tez , st louis , mo us i 'd like to answer ian who posted earlier .
voting in the middle of a war zone is like going out in the morning to college or work place and facing the prospect of a suicide bomber in the way -lrb- frightening but has to be done .
as someone said on this site , voting is voting against violence , not particularly for a certain party or group of persons , but against intimidations by certain people .
i 'm no idealist and i sure hope to survive this period and its aftermath , but i do know that by voting i would tell those certain people that i do n't like their way of thinking and that they do n't speak for the rest of the sunnis -lrb- which i am one of .
mays , baghdad , iraq just want to say to all iraqis out there who may be reading this - good luck for this weekend !
i hope that , despite the probable violence in some areas , the election progresses iraq and you all go a little further down the road to peace , stability and a good life .
the " north american ideals " a canadian contributor derided on this page , are not just north american but global desires for peace , justice and a good life for all our families , friends and neighbours .
that 's something worth voting for !
rachelle , london , uk the elections will not be a magic bullet to fix all the problems in iraq , but it is a start whether they are dodging bullets and bombers or not .
to hear iraqi nationals who live outside the ' death triangle ' describe how they feel about the vote is optimistic , blissful , and hopeful .
the troublemakers are angry that they are losing their control , so they create havoc and murder as a form of social control through fear .
i seriously doubt the elections will be legitimate since so many are being used as pawns in the game of fear , but in the long run i have faith in the iraqi people to show the rest of the middle east how good it can be to have that rare freedom of a constitution protecting their basic human rights .

posted by zeina election candidate , baghdad , 30 january today i went and voted !
i got up early , went out at 10am with my family and walked to the polling station about 10 minutes from my home .
there were many people walking in the street , everyone was running around smiling and happy , it was just like a feast day .
we queued for about 10 minutes and they searched all of us , they even went through my handbag .
then i went in and voted and waited for my family to vote too .
everyone is so excited .
we heard many bombs this morning but we did n't care because we have to use our right to vote .
so many people were afraid to go this morning , but now it seems in the afternoon that more people have voted .
i am so happy , so glad .
later this afternoon we will meet up with our friends for a celebration .
we will have a meal , drink tea and eat cake .
then we will have to head back home because of the 7pm curfew .
i spoke to relatives of mine in najaf and they said people there had voted and that everything was fine .
they too were so happy .
if we are elected then i will go to my party offices in a few days and they will decide what we should do .
i wo n't find out if i have won for two or three days .
i do n't think we shall win because we did n't have many posters or people handing out our papers in the street - so very few people really knew about us .
it was just not safe to campaign .
but it does n't matter .
today is a great day .
read about zeina and the other log contributors comment on this post nobody around here voted posted by tariq al-ani law student , hit , 30 january the city is completely empty today , all you see are the us troops patrolling .
there have been some small clashes , but nothing major .
at least the water and power has been good today .
the atmosphere is very edgy - no-one can guess what 's going to happen .
i did not vote .
nobody did around here did , despite the leaflets dropped by airplanes encouraging us to do so .
last night and this morning i stayed at my relative 's home .
yesterday my wife was afraid because we could hear many vehicles going past where we were , but they did n't seem to cause any trouble and after it went quiet she managed to relax .
i did not vote for many reasons .
the most obvious is simply security - no-one went to the polling station , it was too dangerous .
also , we are not used to this .
in the past it was all propaganda , now we have a new process and people here are just not used to it .
iraqis do n't know what to do .
also the candidates ...
i admire them for having the courage to stand , but they do n't seem to have any real policies or programmes for the future .
i 've had no communication with anyone because of the curfew so i have n't spoken about it with any of my friends , although we 've watched a lot of it on tv .
i suppose tomorrow we can all sit down and talk about it .
it should be interesting !
for the future ... personally i think that half a loaf is better than none as the british would say .
we have no option at the moment here - the situation is so out of control that we must adapt to what is happening .
it may be an important day for iraq , but we 'll see .
i hope it is significant , it 's a chance to move from something unilateral - which we had for so many years - to something multilateral .
we want a legitimate government that will take care of iraq .
we want it to be an open government that creates good relationships with others and ensures our security and prosperity .
surely that is a natural right for any human being ?
read about tariq and the other log contributors comment on this post everybody at the polling station was smiling posted by louay al-tahan iraqi businessman , baghdad , 30 january we were quite worried early in the morning , so we decided to wait till things were clearer .
we kept close watch on the tv and called friends and relatives .
we heard some explosions but not as loud as they usually sound .
finally at around 11:00 local time we decided that it was safe enough to try to vote .
the polling station is about 200m from where i live in the mansoor district of baghdad , so we walked there and it was amazing .
the turnout was high .
all our neighbours and friends were there .
we were welcomed by a group of election officials , and then searched very closely .
everybody was smiling and happy , even the security people - something we are not used to here in iraq .
all the people leaving the polling station were so pleased showing off their finger marked with indelible ink .
we went in , another group of officials checked our id cards against the list of registered voters .
a ballot paper was handed to us .
we waited in line for an empty voting booth .
i made my selection along with my wife and then put them in the ballot boxes .
it was great no-one interfered or imposed their opinion on any one .
the officials were very helpful .
the helped some elderly people inside , gave general instructions on how to use the ballot papers .
when we left the station people were congratulating each other .
in all , i think it has been a great success ... as far as i can see transparent and not biased in any way .
during the whole process i did n't see any americans in the area .
afterwards we took loads of photos with friends and family .
i called friends in other parts of town to congratulate them or to encourage them to vote .
later in the afternoon , at about 1600 , it felt so safe and quite , i took my wife and two daughters for a walk .
this is something we have n't done for quite a while .
we walked by two busy polling stations .
it was amazing people we do n't know were asking us if we had voted , and congratulating us on doing so .
read about louay and the other log contributors comment on this post i voted but i missed the tennis final posted by youssef iraqi doctor , basra , 30 january well , thank god the elections went ahead without big disturbances .
we heard two explosions early this morning .
i heard later that these particular attacks caused no injuries at all .
and yes , i did manage to go and actually vote for the list i thought was the best , but i had to walk a total of 10km on foot because of the ban imposed on all cars other than police cars and ambulances .
it took me about three and a half hours to do this so i missed the last two sets of the final of the australian open tennis .
i am pleased safin won .
i 'm a great fan of his .
despite the tiresome trip , i think it was worth every step to share in this process .
there were a lot of checkpoints all through the way and we were checked with a metal detector before getting into the hall where we did the actual paper work .
it was really well organised and i think the tough security measures - as annoying as they were - contributed to the relatively high turn out .
almost everyone i know voted .
last night , just after midnight , loudspeakers of the mosques called on people not to use the tap water because it had been contaminated by saboteurs .
to tell you the truth , it caused a wave of panic throughout the city and my phone kept ringing as friends were spreading the news to each other .
then , around 02:00 this morning , police cars started patrolling the city telling everyone through loud speakers , that it was all a rumour and that there was nothing wrong with tap water .
everyone remained cautious , though , but not a single case of any sort of poisoning was registered all through basra so i guess it was just paranoia .
read about youssef and the other log contributors comment on this post it 's very quiet ...
which is really weird posted by susan american aid worker , northern iraq , 30 january thankfully nothing bad has happened where i am today .
on friday , there were two explosions here in the evening , about 10 minutes apart .
they happened roughly the same place , not far from the city 's main market place .
the first was in a trash container , the second under a pile of sand .
four people were injured , none killed .
my friends in the city told me there was a car with baghdad number plates parked near their house .
they called police , who came and questioned the driver .
he would n't say where he was from .
after that , apparently the driver was taken into custody and tnt was found in the car .
today it has been really quiet where i am because of the traffic ban .
last night they were still allowing traffic into the main city until the late evening .
there are now lots of concrete barriers up and many roads have been blocked off .
i went out around 6pm and there were still people milling about .
from the roof of my house , through the mist , i can see one of the polling stations .
there are local armed guards stationed on the roofs around it , keeping an eye on things .
there are n't many long lines of voters .
i 'd say it was more of a steady stream .
people seem normal , certainly no-one is looking scared or running around , it 's just very quiet - which is a little weird .
if they 're not voting i guess people are mostly staying at home .
from what i can tell , speaking to local friends here , people believe that voting will help them .
they say it will still be a struggle , but the kurds in general seem positive about it .
they do n't expect miracles , in fact some are quite cynical about the choices they have on the ballot papers .

the more power the parties have the greater the chance of more independence , she told me .

i believe that a bright future for iraq requires great efforts and sacrifices , and today , the election day , is the time to show those sacrifices by going to vote no matter what !
peace be upon everyone that is going to vote .
mohammed , western new york , usa for children of iraqi exiles , the most important events in our lives took place before we were even born .
today , on the first day of out-of-country voting , this is no longer true .
as an iraqi-american born and raised in the us , i plan to vote in the ocv program today .
i have never been to iraq , but both my parents are iraqi and it has always been the basis of my identity .
i am proud to vote and be a part of the future or iraq .
i have tremendous admiration for the election log contributors who are brave enough to risk their lives to fight a state of perpetual inconsequence .
babylonia marcus , washington , dc , usa it 's time for the rest of the world to get behind this project to get iraq back on its feet .
regardless of past disagreement on the war - what alternative is there ? ; i think its a shame that much of the passion on the issue of iraq is spent on ' disagreeing ' with america and arguing about the questionable justification of the war and not on unequivocally condemning the atrocities being committed by the insurgents .
olawande kasumu , lagos , nigeria to ian stephenson : you said north american , that would include you , since you are from canada .
blissful is not what most people have in mind when it comes to iraq .
the fact that they are able to vote is somewhat of a miracle all by itself , is n't it ?
whether it is in the middle of the " war zone " -lrb- as you put it -rrb- or not .
how many of these people are thankful they can vote at all ?
how many died for one person to vote ?
if you had been bound up for 50 years and suddenly freedom was at your door , would n't you pay the price , no matter what the cost ?
tez , st louis , mo us i 'd like to answer ian who posted earlier .
voting in the middle of a war zone is like going out in the morning to college or work place and facing the prospect of a suicide bomber in the way -lrb- frightening but has to be done .
as someone said on this site , voting is voting against violence , not particularly for a certain party or group of persons , but against intimidations by certain people .
i 'm no idealist and i sure hope to survive this period and its aftermath , but i do know that by voting i would tell those certain people that i do n't like their way of thinking and that they do n't speak for the rest of the sunnis -lrb- which i am one of .
mays , baghdad , iraq just want to say to all iraqis out there who may be reading this - good luck for this weekend !
i hope that , despite the probable violence in some areas , the election progresses iraq and you all go a little further down the road to peace , stability and a good life .
the " north american ideals " a canadian contributor derided on this page , are not just north american but global desires for peace , justice and a good life for all our families , friends and neighbours .
that 's something worth voting for !
rachelle , london , uk the elections will not be a magic bullet to fix all the problems in iraq , but it is a start whether they are dodging bullets and bombers or not .
to hear iraqi nationals who live outside the ' death triangle ' describe how they feel about the vote is optimistic , blissful , and hopeful .
the troublemakers are angry that they are losing their control , so they create havoc and murder as a form of social control through fear .
i seriously doubt the elections will be legitimate since so many are being used as pawns in the game of fear , but in the long run i have faith in the iraqi people to show the rest of the middle east how good it can be to have that rare freedom of a constitution protecting their basic human rights .

posted by zeina election candidate , baghdad , 30 january today i went and voted !
i got up early , went out at 10am with my family and walked to the polling station about 10 minutes from my home .
there were many people walking in the street , everyone was running around smiling and happy , it was just like a feast day .
we queued for about 10 minutes and they searched all of us , they even went through my handbag .
then i went in and voted and waited for my family to vote too .
everyone is so excited .
we heard many bombs this morning but we did n't care because we have to use our right to vote .
so many people were afraid to go this morning , but now it seems in the afternoon that more people have voted .
i am so happy , so glad .
later this afternoon we will meet up with our friends for a celebration .
we will have a meal , drink tea and eat cake .
then we will have to head back home because of the 7pm curfew .
i spoke to relatives of mine in najaf and they said people there had voted and that everything was fine .
they too were so happy .
if we are elected then i will go to my party offices in a few days and they will decide what we should do .
i wo n't find out if i have won for two or three days .
i do n't think we shall win because we did n't have many posters or people handing out our papers in the street - so very few people really knew about us .
it was just not safe to campaign .
but it does n't matter .
today is a great day .
read about zeina and the other log contributors comment on this post nobody around here voted posted by tariq al-ani law student , hit , 30 january the city is completely empty today , all you see are the us troops patrolling .
there have been some small clashes , but nothing major .
at least the water and power has been good today .
the atmosphere is very edgy - no-one can guess what 's going to happen .
i did not vote .
nobody did around here did , despite the leaflets dropped by airplanes encouraging us to do so .
last night and this morning i stayed at my relative 's home .
yesterday my wife was afraid because we could hear many vehicles going past where we were , but they did n't seem to cause any trouble and after it went quiet she managed to relax .
i did not vote for many reasons .
the most obvious is simply security - no-one went to the polling station , it was too dangerous .
also , we are not used to this .
in the past it was all propaganda , now we have a new process and people here are just not used to it .
iraqis do n't know what to do .
also the candidates ...
i admire them for having the courage to stand , but they do n't seem to have any real policies or programmes for the future .
i 've had no communication with anyone because of the curfew so i have n't spoken about it with any of my friends , although we 've watched a lot of it on tv .
i suppose tomorrow we can all sit down and talk about it .
it should be interesting !
for the future ... personally i think that half a loaf is better than none as the british would say .
we have no option at the moment here - the situation is so out of control that we must adapt to what is happening .
it may be an important day for iraq , but we 'll see .
i hope it is significant , it 's a chance to move from something unilateral - which we had for so many years - to something multilateral .
we want a legitimate government that will take care of iraq .
we want it to be an open government that creates good relationships with others and ensures our security and prosperity .
surely that is a natural right for any human being ?
read about tariq and the other log contributors comment on this post everybody at the polling station was smiling posted by louay al-tahan iraqi businessman , baghdad , 30 january we were quite worried early in the morning , so we decided to wait till things were clearer .
we kept close watch on the tv and called friends and relatives .
we heard some explosions but not as loud as they usually sound .
finally at around 11:00 local time we decided that it was safe enough to try to vote .
the polling station is about 200m from where i live in the mansoor district of baghdad , so we walked there and it was amazing .
the turnout was high .
all our neighbours and friends were there .
we were welcomed by a group of election officials , and then searched very closely .
everybody was smiling and happy , even the security people - something we are not used to here in iraq .
all the people leaving the polling station were so pleased showing off their finger marked with indelible ink .
we went in , another group of officials checked our id cards against the list of registered voters .
a ballot paper was handed to us .
we waited in line for an empty voting booth .
i made my selection along with my wife and then put them in the ballot boxes .
it was great no-one interfered or imposed their opinion on any one .
the officials were very helpful .
the helped some elderly people inside , gave general instructions on how to use the ballot papers .
when we left the station people were congratulating each other .
in all , i think it has been a great success ... as far as i can see transparent and not biased in any way .
during the whole process i did n't see any americans in the area .
afterwards we took loads of photos with friends and family .
i called friends in other parts of town to congratulate them or to encourage them to vote .
later in the afternoon , at about 1600 , it felt so safe and quite , i took my wife and two daughters for a walk .
this is something we have n't done for quite a while .
we walked by two busy polling stations .
it was amazing people we do n't know were asking us if we had voted , and congratulating us on doing so .
read about louay and the other log contributors comment on this post i voted but i missed the tennis final posted by youssef iraqi doctor , basra , 30 january well , thank god the elections went ahead without big disturbances .
we heard two explosions early this morning .
i heard later that these particular attacks caused no injuries at all .
and yes , i did manage to go and actually vote for the list i thought was the best , but i had to walk a total of 10km on foot because of the ban imposed on all cars other than police cars and ambulances .
it took me about three and a half hours to do this so i missed the last two sets of the final of the australian open tennis .
i am pleased safin won .
i 'm a great fan of his .
despite the tiresome trip , i think it was worth every step to share in this process .
there were a lot of checkpoints all through the way and we were checked with a metal detector before getting into the hall where we did the actual paper work .
it was really well organised and i think the tough security measures - as annoying as they were - contributed to the relatively high turn out .
almost everyone i know voted .
last night , just after midnight , loudspeakers of the mosques called on people not to use the tap water because it had been contaminated by saboteurs .
to tell you the truth , it caused a wave of panic throughout the city and my phone kept ringing as friends were spreading the news to each other .
then , around 02:00 this morning , police cars started patrolling the city telling everyone through loud speakers , that it was all a rumour and that there was nothing wrong with tap water .
everyone remained cautious , though , but not a single case of any sort of poisoning was registered all through basra so i guess it was just paranoia .
read about youssef and the other log contributors comment on this post it 's very quiet ...
which is really weird posted by susan american aid worker , northern iraq , 30 january thankfully nothing bad has happened where i am today .
on friday , there were two explosions here in the evening , about 10 minutes apart .
they happened roughly the same place , not far from the city 's main market place .
the first was in a trash container , the second under a pile of sand .
four people were injured , none killed .
my friends in the city told me there was a car with baghdad number plates parked near their house .
they called police , who came and questioned the driver .
he would n't say where he was from .
after that , apparently the driver was taken into custody and tnt was found in the car .
today it has been really quiet where i am because of the traffic ban .
last night they were still allowing traffic into the main city until the late evening .
there are now lots of concrete barriers up and many roads have been blocked off .
i went out around 6pm and there were still people milling about .
from the roof of my house , through the mist , i can see one of the polling stations .
there are local armed guards stationed on the roofs around it , keeping an eye on things .
there are n't many long lines of voters .
i 'd say it was more of a steady stream .
people seem normal , certainly no-one is looking scared or running around , it 's just very quiet - which is a little weird .
if they 're not voting i guess people are mostly staying at home .
from what i can tell , speaking to local friends here , people believe that voting will help them .
they say it will still be a struggle , but the kurds in general seem positive about it .
they do n't expect miracles , in fact some are quite cynical about the choices they have on the ballot papers .
one friend told me she was voting for one of the main kurdish parties -lsb- northern alliance -rsb- because she believes this will give her people more power .
the more power the parties have the greater the chance of more independence , she told me .
read about susan and the other log contributors comment on this post these are some of the comments we have received so far about this log .
some of the comments refer to previous logs : 28 january 2005 27 january 2005 26 january 2005 25 january 2005 24 january 2005 click here to read last year 's log on daily life in iraq these are some of the comments we have received so far about this log .
it was a turning point for iraq and for iraqis , i admire the brave people who went to polling stations and cast their vote for their future .
but there are a lot of things to be done by the people of iraq .
dr. najibullah , kabul , afghanistan i stayed up until 0400 to watch the iraqi vote on tv .
i was truly moved to tears when i saw the joy and pride on the iraqi faces as they voted for the first time .
the iraqi people have been through so much before and after the invasion of iraq .
so many lives have been lost and so much destruction has taken place to get to the day where the people of iraq could finally choose the type of government that they want .
it seems that we here in america take the right to vote for granted .
today is a reminder of the price that is paid to have democracy .
congratulations to the people of iraq and may god bless all of you and your country .
greg , redmond , washington , usa i whole heartedly empathize how tariq al ani is feeling as he does not know what to expect next .
yes it is true that a journey of million miles must begin with a single step but when there is so much chaos and lawlessness , it gives us very little reason to be optimistic .
we too are facing a similar situation out here as the crisis between government forces and maoist rebels deepens - though not in the scale as in iraq - and majority of the population are so much insecure about their future , so i am sure the majority of the people in iraq are feeling the same way .
to say the least all we can do is hope for the best and that 's all we have .
prashant pradhan , kathmandu , nepal .
it is wonderful to hear from iraqis ; our media filters news and it is difficult to know whether or not we are hearing the truth .
every day there are more people killed , americans and iraqis , but we hear only the body count for americans .
can someone tell me how many iraqis have died since the invasion ?
melanie faith , amherst , ma , us i honestly believe that the whole world is on the side of the iraqi people .
everyone wants to fight for you -lrb- each in their own way -rrb- .
that includes europeans , asians , africans , americans , arabs , iranians , russians , pacific islanders and whoever else you care to mention on these boards .
whether people opposed or supported the war , they honestly want to see the iraqi people win .
it 's only through your vote we will know what you want .
jamie , australia i am amazed at the courage of the iraqis who are going out to vote at this time .
here in the west we talk and vote according to our wishes .
never do we have to look over our shoulders when we express an opinion .
we have almost total security of person .
yet so many of us take these rights for granted and do not even bother to vote at election time .
here in iraq we have a people who are used only to oppression , yet they put their lives on the line to vote .
i can only applaud their bravery , and pray that a new and democratic government will bring them the happiness and security which the sacrifices of coalition troops have paid for .
clive hickson , winnipeg , canada i read an article where one iraqi described election day as " a wedding for all of iraq " .
it 's very encouraging to see so many brave the danger to exercise their rights .
i also understand those who could not put themselves in danger , in the most dangerous cities such as hit .
democracy is not supposed to be a suicide pact .
those people will have to allow their fellow citizens to start the process of representative government for them , this time .
put aside the religious differences for now , today you are all iraqis .
democracy is no respecter of religion .
congratulations on your newfound freedom .
faye , el paso , tx , usa it is sobering to think that a car with tnt could be parked outside my home .
i am glad there is a system to alert police ; it seems to work well to prevent these acts .
i only hope all those in iraq have access to communication .
the more , the better .
i know there are still mistakes made by the authorities , and hopefully in time it will be better .
i thank bbc for setting this journal up .
it is great to hear from iraqis this way , as it feels very close and personal .
good luck to all of you .
louis di meglio , brooklyn , ny usa dr youssef , i am praying for you and your family .
sometimes i believe so strongly that the american government will do what is right and fair for the brave people of iraq , while other times i truly wonder where the sense is in all of this .
how is your family ?
how are your children doing through all of this ?
what does your wife think about the elections ?
i can not even imagine what you are living through .
i admire you and the other brave citizens of iraq and i encourage you to vote .
it is your right to vote and to elect whoever you want to lead you .
once again , know that my prayers are with you and your family .
crystal young , los angeles , usa i have opposed the iraq war from the outset .
despite that , i woke up early to search the news for reports on the voter turnout and progress on voting .
it may be the first time that bush and i have hoped for the same thing .
let 's hope that the estimates of voter turnout are not overly optimistic .
but having said that , it 's hard not to feel optimism for iraq 's future and awe at the bravery of people who would risk their lives in order to vote .
i 'm also struck that the honour and courage of a people is far more effective in staring down the face of terrorism than any " war on terror " we 've been able to muster .
pat , red bank , nj usa this comment is for mr. tariq al-ani .
hi tariq and hi to your wife and children .
your description of relaxing in the desert was well-written .
i 'm here in brooklyn where the neighbour next door is scraping at the snow with his shovel !
i hope your whole family will be blessed with peace and safety and i admire you and your family for staying happy in spite of all that 's so hard for you now .
kim worthy , brooklyn , new york thanks bbc for giving un-edited voice to the people living behind the headlines .
and to everyone involved in the elections this weekend - a huge good luck .
my thoughts and prayers are with you .
kiki stevens , minneapolis , usa so many can not comprehend the threats people are facing when going to the polls .
honestly , would you send your family to vote knowing it is a life or death situation and that they would not come back tomorrow ?
i believe in the elections and have voted .
the faith of the iraqi people has been tested many times and some are prepared to sacrifice their life for the vote and a better future for their people .
husain , baghdad , iraq i think the national election in iraq is very important to the iraqi population .
i hope all areas of the country will be represented despite hardships the voters will be going through .
as i read your article today on the positive kurdish response to the election and for the high hopes they have for a new iraq it confirms my belief there is an excellent chance for iraq people to be better off tomorrow than yesterday .
i encourage everyone that is eligible to vote and then support the government that is elected .
stephen segall , united states as in my own country , south africa , we see the potential for a new , dynamic and free country of citizens who put the interests of the common good above their own separatist and racist tendencies .
as long as we can stop george bush from making pronouncements about ' crusades ' and the like , there is a chance that iraqis see this as a historic moment for themselves .
let love and peace triumph over hate , fear and despair .
andy lawrence , united arab emirates i am an iraqi living in the us .
i watch the news and i ca n't quit thinking of what 's going on in my country .
i believe that a bright future for iraq requires great efforts and sacrifices , and today , the election day , is the time to show those sacrifices by going to vote no matter what !
peace be upon everyone that is going to vote .
mohammed , western new york , usa for children of iraqi exiles , the most important events in our lives took place before we were even born .

last night and this morning i stayed at my relative 's home .
yesterday my wife was afraid because we could hear many vehicles going past where we were , but they did n't seem to cause any trouble and after it went quiet she managed to relax .
i did not vote for many reasons .
the most obvious is simply security - no-one went to the polling station , it was too dangerous .
also , we are not used to this .
in the past it was all propaganda , now we have a new process and people here are just not used to it .
iraqis do n't know what to do .
also the candidates ...
i admire them for having the courage to stand , but they do n't seem to have any real policies or programmes for the future .
i 've had no communication with anyone because of the curfew so i have n't spoken about it with any of my friends , although we 've watched a lot of it on tv .
i suppose tomorrow we can all sit down and talk about it .
it should be interesting !
for the future ... personally i think that half a loaf is better than none as the british would say .
we have no option at the moment here - the situation is so out of control that we must adapt to what is happening .
it may be an important day for iraq , but we 'll see .
i hope it is significant , it 's a chance to move from something unilateral - which we had for so many years - to something multilateral .
we want a legitimate government that will take care of iraq .
we want it to be an open government that creates good relationships with others and ensures our security and prosperity .
surely that is a natural right for any human being ?
read about tariq and the other log contributors comment on this post everybody at the polling station was smiling posted by louay al-tahan iraqi businessman , baghdad , 30 january we were quite worried early in the morning , so we decided to wait till things were clearer .
we kept close watch on the tv and called friends and relatives .
we heard some explosions but not as loud as they usually sound .
finally at around 11:00 local time we decided that it was safe enough to try to vote .
the polling station is about 200m from where i live in the mansoor district of baghdad , so we walked there and it was amazing .
the turnout was high .
all our neighbours and friends were there .
we were welcomed by a group of election officials , and then searched very closely .
everybody was smiling and happy , even the security people - something we are not used to here in iraq .
all the people leaving the polling station were so pleased showing off their finger marked with indelible ink .
we went in , another group of officials checked our id cards against the list of registered voters .
a ballot paper was handed to us .
we waited in line for an empty voting booth .
i made my selection along with my wife and then put them in the ballot boxes .
it was great no-one interfered or imposed their opinion on any one .
the officials were very helpful .
the helped some elderly people inside , gave general instructions on how to use the ballot papers .
when we left the station people were congratulating each other .
in all , i think it has been a great success ... as far as i can see transparent and not biased in any way .
during the whole process i did n't see any americans in the area .
afterwards we took loads of photos with friends and family .
i called friends in other parts of town to congratulate them or to encourage them to vote .
later in the afternoon , at about 1600 , it felt so safe and quite , i took my wife and two daughters for a walk .
this is something we have n't done for quite a while .
we walked by two busy polling stations .
it was amazing people we do n't know were asking us if we had voted , and congratulating us on doing so .
read about louay and the other log contributors comment on this post i voted but i missed the tennis final posted by youssef iraqi doctor , basra , 30 january well , thank god the elections went ahead without big disturbances .
we heard two explosions early this morning .
i heard later that these particular attacks caused no injuries at all .
and yes , i did manage to go and actually vote for the list i thought was the best , but i had to walk a total of 10km on foot because of the ban imposed on all cars other than police cars and ambulances .
it took me about three and a half hours to do this so i missed the last two sets of the final of the australian open tennis .
i am pleased safin won .
i 'm a great fan of his .
despite the tiresome trip , i think it was worth every step to share in this process .
there were a lot of checkpoints all through the way and we were checked with a metal detector before getting into the hall where we did the actual paper work .
it was really well organised and i think the tough security measures - as annoying as they were - contributed to the relatively high turn out .
almost everyone i know voted .
last night , just after midnight , loudspeakers of the mosques called on people not to use the tap water because it had been contaminated by saboteurs .
to tell you the truth , it caused a wave of panic throughout the city and my phone kept ringing as friends were spreading the news to each other .
then , around 02:00 this morning , police cars started patrolling the city telling everyone through loud speakers , that it was all a rumour and that there was nothing wrong with tap water .
everyone remained cautious , though , but not a single case of any sort of poisoning was registered all through basra so i guess it was just paranoia .
read about youssef and the other log contributors comment on this post it 's very quiet ...
which is really weird posted by susan american aid worker , northern iraq , 30 january thankfully nothing bad has happened where i am today .
on friday , there were two explosions here in the evening , about 10 minutes apart .
they happened roughly the same place , not far from the city 's main market place .
the first was in a trash container , the second under a pile of sand .
four people were injured , none killed .
my friends in the city told me there was a car with baghdad number plates parked near their house .
they called police , who came and questioned the driver .
he would n't say where he was from .
after that , apparently the driver was taken into custody and tnt was found in the car .
today it has been really quiet where i am because of the traffic ban .
last night they were still allowing traffic into the main city until the late evening .
there are now lots of concrete barriers up and many roads have been blocked off .
i went out around 6pm and there were still people milling about .
from the roof of my house , through the mist , i can see one of the polling stations .
there are local armed guards stationed on the roofs around it , keeping an eye on things .
there are n't many long lines of voters .
i 'd say it was more of a steady stream .
people seem normal , certainly no-one is looking scared or running around , it 's just very quiet - which is a little weird .
if they 're not voting i guess people are mostly staying at home .
from what i can tell , speaking to local friends here , people believe that voting will help them .
they say it will still be a struggle , but the kurds in general seem positive about it .
they do n't expect miracles , in fact some are quite cynical about the choices they have on the ballot papers .
one friend told me she was voting for one of the main kurdish parties -lsb- northern alliance -rsb- because she believes this will give her people more power .
the more power the parties have the greater the chance of more independence , she told me .

it was a turning point for iraq and for iraqis , i admire the brave people who went to polling stations and cast their vote for their future .
but there are a lot of things to be done by the people of iraq .
dr. najibullah , kabul , afghanistan i stayed up until 0400 to watch the iraqi vote on tv .
i was truly moved to tears when i saw the joy and pride on the iraqi faces as they voted for the first time .
the iraqi people have been through so much before and after the invasion of iraq .
so many lives have been lost and so much destruction has taken place to get to the day where the people of iraq could finally choose the type of government that they want .
it seems that we here in america take the right to vote for granted .
today is a reminder of the price that is paid to have democracy .
congratulations to the people of iraq and may god bless all of you and your country .
greg , redmond , washington , usa i whole heartedly empathize how tariq al ani is feeling as he does not know what to expect next .
yes it is true that a journey of million miles must begin with a single step but when there is so much chaos and lawlessness , it gives us very little reason to be optimistic .
we too are facing a similar situation out here as the crisis between government forces and maoist rebels deepens - though not in the scale as in iraq - and majority of the population are so much insecure about their future , so i am sure the majority of the people in iraq are feeling the same way .
to say the least all we can do is hope for the best and that 's all we have .
prashant pradhan , kathmandu , nepal .
it is wonderful to hear from iraqis ; our media filters news and it is difficult to know whether or not we are hearing the truth .
every day there are more people killed , americans and iraqis , but we hear only the body count for americans .
can someone tell me how many iraqis have died since the invasion ?
melanie faith , amherst , ma , us i honestly believe that the whole world is on the side of the iraqi people .
everyone wants to fight for you -lrb- each in their own way -rrb- .
that includes europeans , asians , africans , americans , arabs , iranians , russians , pacific islanders and whoever else you care to mention on these boards .
whether people opposed or supported the war , they honestly want to see the iraqi people win .
it 's only through your vote we will know what you want .
jamie , australia i am amazed at the courage of the iraqis who are going out to vote at this time .
here in the west we talk and vote according to our wishes .
never do we have to look over our shoulders when we express an opinion .
we have almost total security of person .
yet so many of us take these rights for granted and do not even bother to vote at election time .
here in iraq we have a people who are used only to oppression , yet they put their lives on the line to vote .
i can only applaud their bravery , and pray that a new and democratic government will bring them the happiness and security which the sacrifices of coalition troops have paid for .
clive hickson , winnipeg , canada i read an article where one iraqi described election day as " a wedding for all of iraq " .
it 's very encouraging to see so many brave the danger to exercise their rights .
i also understand those who could not put themselves in danger , in the most dangerous cities such as hit .
democracy is not supposed to be a suicide pact .
those people will have to allow their fellow citizens to start the process of representative government for them , this time .
put aside the religious differences for now , today you are all iraqis .
democracy is no respecter of religion .
congratulations on your newfound freedom .
faye , el paso , tx , usa it is sobering to think that a car with tnt could be parked outside my home .
i am glad there is a system to alert police ; it seems to work well to prevent these acts .
i only hope all those in iraq have access to communication .
the more , the better .
i know there are still mistakes made by the authorities , and hopefully in time it will be better .
i thank bbc for setting this journal up .
it is great to hear from iraqis this way , as it feels very close and personal .
good luck to all of you .
louis di meglio , brooklyn , ny usa dr youssef , i am praying for you and your family .
sometimes i believe so strongly that the american government will do what is right and fair for the brave people of iraq , while other times i truly wonder where the sense is in all of this .
how is your family ?
how are your children doing through all of this ?
what does your wife think about the elections ?
i can not even imagine what you are living through .
i admire you and the other brave citizens of iraq and i encourage you to vote .
it is your right to vote and to elect whoever you want to lead you .
once again , know that my prayers are with you and your family .
crystal young , los angeles , usa i have opposed the iraq war from the outset .
despite that , i woke up early to search the news for reports on the voter turnout and progress on voting .
it may be the first time that bush and i have hoped for the same thing .
let 's hope that the estimates of voter turnout are not overly optimistic .
but having said that , it 's hard not to feel optimism for iraq 's future and awe at the bravery of people who would risk their lives in order to vote .
i 'm also struck that the honour and courage of a people is far more effective in staring down the face of terrorism than any " war on terror " we 've been able to muster .
pat , red bank , nj usa this comment is for mr. tariq al-ani .
hi tariq and hi to your wife and children .
your description of relaxing in the desert was well-written .
i 'm here in brooklyn where the neighbour next door is scraping at the snow with his shovel !
i hope your whole family will be blessed with peace and safety and i admire you and your family for staying happy in spite of all that 's so hard for you now .
kim worthy , brooklyn , new york thanks bbc for giving un-edited voice to the people living behind the headlines .
and to everyone involved in the elections this weekend - a huge good luck .
my thoughts and prayers are with you .
kiki stevens , minneapolis , usa so many can not comprehend the threats people are facing when going to the polls .
honestly , would you send your family to vote knowing it is a life or death situation and that they would not come back tomorrow ?
i believe in the elections and have voted .
the faith of the iraqi people has been tested many times and some are prepared to sacrifice their life for the vote and a better future for their people .
husain , baghdad , iraq i think the national election in iraq is very important to the iraqi population .
i hope all areas of the country will be represented despite hardships the voters will be going through .
as i read your article today on the positive kurdish response to the election and for the high hopes they have for a new iraq it confirms my belief there is an excellent chance for iraq people to be better off tomorrow than yesterday .
i encourage everyone that is eligible to vote and then support the government that is elected .
stephen segall , united states as in my own country , south africa , we see the potential for a new , dynamic and free country of citizens who put the interests of the common good above their own separatist and racist tendencies .
as long as we can stop george bush from making pronouncements about ' crusades ' and the like , there is a chance that iraqis see this as a historic moment for themselves .
let love and peace triumph over hate , fear and despair .
andy lawrence , united arab emirates i am an iraqi living in the us .
i watch the news and i ca n't quit thinking of what 's going on in my country .
i believe that a bright future for iraq requires great efforts and sacrifices , and today , the election day , is the time to show those sacrifices by going to vote no matter what !
peace be upon everyone that is going to vote .
mohammed , western new york , usa for children of iraqi exiles , the most important events in our lives took place before we were even born .
today , on the first day of out-of-country voting , this is no longer true .
as an iraqi-american born and raised in the us , i plan to vote in the ocv program today .
i have never been to iraq , but both my parents are iraqi and it has always been the basis of my identity .
i am proud to vote and be a part of the future or iraq .
i have tremendous admiration for the election log contributors who are brave enough to risk their lives to fight a state of perpetual inconsequence .
babylonia marcus , washington , dc , usa it 's time for the rest of the world to get behind this project to get iraq back on its feet .
regardless of past disagreement on the war - what alternative is there ? ; i think its a shame that much of the passion on the issue of iraq is spent on ' disagreeing ' with america and arguing about the questionable justification of the war and not on unequivocally condemning the atrocities being committed by the insurgents .
olawande kasumu , lagos , nigeria to ian stephenson : you said north american , that would include you , since you are from canada .
blissful is not what most people have in mind when it comes to iraq .
the fact that they are able to vote is somewhat of a miracle all by itself , is n't it ?
whether it is in the middle of the " war zone " -lrb- as you put it -rrb- or not .
how many of these people are thankful they can vote at all ?
how many died for one person to vote ?
if you had been bound up for 50 years and suddenly freedom was at your door , would n't you pay the price , no matter what the cost ?
tez , st louis , mo us i 'd like to answer ian who posted earlier .
voting in the middle of a war zone is like going out in the morning to college or work place and facing the prospect of a suicide bomber in the way -lrb- frightening but has to be done .
as someone said on this site , voting is voting against violence , not particularly for a certain party or group of persons , but against intimidations by certain people .
i 'm no idealist and i sure hope to survive this period and its aftermath , but i do know that by voting i would tell those certain people that i do n't like their way of thinking and that they do n't speak for the rest of the sunnis -lrb- which i am one of .
mays , baghdad , iraq just want to say to all iraqis out there who may be reading this - good luck for this weekend !
i hope that , despite the probable violence in some areas , the election progresses iraq and you all go a little further down the road to peace , stability and a good life .
the " north american ideals " a canadian contributor derided on this page , are not just north american but global desires for peace , justice and a good life for all our families , friends and neighbours .
that 's something worth voting for !
rachelle , london , uk the elections will not be a magic bullet to fix all the problems in iraq , but it is a start whether they are dodging bullets and bombers or not .
to hear iraqi nationals who live outside the ' death triangle ' describe how they feel about the vote is optimistic , blissful , and hopeful .
the troublemakers are angry that they are losing their control , so they create havoc and murder as a form of social control through fear .
i seriously doubt the elections will be legitimate since so many are being used as pawns in the game of fear , but in the long run i have faith in the iraqi people to show the rest of the middle east how good it can be to have that rare freedom of a constitution protecting their basic human rights .

posted by zeina election candidate , baghdad , 30 january today i went and voted !
i got up early , went out at 10am with my family and walked to the polling station about 10 minutes from my home .
there were many people walking in the street , everyone was running around smiling and happy , it was just like a feast day .
we queued for about 10 minutes and they searched all of us , they even went through my handbag .
then i went in and voted and waited for my family to vote too .
everyone is so excited .
we heard many bombs this morning but we did n't care because we have to use our right to vote .
so many people were afraid to go this morning , but now it seems in the afternoon that more people have voted .
i am so happy , so glad .
later this afternoon we will meet up with our friends for a celebration .
we will have a meal , drink tea and eat cake .
then we will have to head back home because of the 7pm curfew .
i spoke to relatives of mine in najaf and they said people there had voted and that everything was fine .
they too were so happy .
if we are elected then i will go to my party offices in a few days and they will decide what we should do .
i wo n't find out if i have won for two or three days .
i do n't think we shall win because we did n't have many posters or people handing out our papers in the street - so very few people really knew about us .
it was just not safe to campaign .
but it does n't matter .
today is a great day .
read about zeina and the other log contributors comment on this post nobody around here voted posted by tariq al-ani law student , hit , 30 january the city is completely empty today , all you see are the us troops patrolling .
there have been some small clashes , but nothing major .
at least the water and power has been good today .

i did not vote .

greg , redmond , washington , usa i whole heartedly empathize how tariq al ani is feeling as he does not know what to expect next .
yes it is true that a journey of million miles must begin with a single step but when there is so much chaos and lawlessness , it gives us very little reason to be optimistic .
we too are facing a similar situation out here as the crisis between government forces and maoist rebels deepens - though not in the scale as in iraq - and majority of the population are so much insecure about their future , so i am sure the majority of the people in iraq are feeling the same way .
to say the least all we can do is hope for the best and that 's all we have .
prashant pradhan , kathmandu , nepal .
it is wonderful to hear from iraqis ; our media filters news and it is difficult to know whether or not we are hearing the truth .
every day there are more people killed , americans and iraqis , but we hear only the body count for americans .
can someone tell me how many iraqis have died since the invasion ?
melanie faith , amherst , ma , us i honestly believe that the whole world is on the side of the iraqi people .
everyone wants to fight for you -lrb- each in their own way -rrb- .
that includes europeans , asians , africans , americans , arabs , iranians , russians , pacific islanders and whoever else you care to mention on these boards .
whether people opposed or supported the war , they honestly want to see the iraqi people win .
it 's only through your vote we will know what you want .
jamie , australia i am amazed at the courage of the iraqis who are going out to vote at this time .
here in the west we talk and vote according to our wishes .
never do we have to look over our shoulders when we express an opinion .
we have almost total security of person .
yet so many of us take these rights for granted and do not even bother to vote at election time .
here in iraq we have a people who are used only to oppression , yet they put their lives on the line to vote .
i can only applaud their bravery , and pray that a new and democratic government will bring them the happiness and security which the sacrifices of coalition troops have paid for .
clive hickson , winnipeg , canada i read an article where one iraqi described election day as " a wedding for all of iraq " .
it 's very encouraging to see so many brave the danger to exercise their rights .
i also understand those who could not put themselves in danger , in the most dangerous cities such as hit .
democracy is not supposed to be a suicide pact .
those people will have to allow their fellow citizens to start the process of representative government for them , this time .
put aside the religious differences for now , today you are all iraqis .
democracy is no respecter of religion .
congratulations on your newfound freedom .
faye , el paso , tx , usa it is sobering to think that a car with tnt could be parked outside my home .
i am glad there is a system to alert police ; it seems to work well to prevent these acts .
i only hope all those in iraq have access to communication .
the more , the better .
i know there are still mistakes made by the authorities , and hopefully in time it will be better .
i thank bbc for setting this journal up .
it is great to hear from iraqis this way , as it feels very close and personal .
good luck to all of you .
louis di meglio , brooklyn , ny usa dr youssef , i am praying for you and your family .
sometimes i believe so strongly that the american government will do what is right and fair for the brave people of iraq , while other times i truly wonder where the sense is in all of this .
how is your family ?
how are your children doing through all of this ?
what does your wife think about the elections ?
i can not even imagine what you are living through .
i admire you and the other brave citizens of iraq and i encourage you to vote .
it is your right to vote and to elect whoever you want to lead you .
once again , know that my prayers are with you and your family .
crystal young , los angeles , usa i have opposed the iraq war from the outset .
despite that , i woke up early to search the news for reports on the voter turnout and progress on voting .
it may be the first time that bush and i have hoped for the same thing .
let 's hope that the estimates of voter turnout are not overly optimistic .
but having said that , it 's hard not to feel optimism for iraq 's future and awe at the bravery of people who would risk their lives in order to vote .
i 'm also struck that the honour and courage of a people is far more effective in staring down the face of terrorism than any " war on terror " we 've been able to muster .
pat , red bank , nj usa this comment is for mr. tariq al-ani .
hi tariq and hi to your wife and children .
your description of relaxing in the desert was well-written .
i 'm here in brooklyn where the neighbour next door is scraping at the snow with his shovel !
i hope your whole family will be blessed with peace and safety and i admire you and your family for staying happy in spite of all that 's so hard for you now .
kim worthy , brooklyn , new york thanks bbc for giving un-edited voice to the people living behind the headlines .
and to everyone involved in the elections this weekend - a huge good luck .
my thoughts and prayers are with you .
kiki stevens , minneapolis , usa so many can not comprehend the threats people are facing when going to the polls .
honestly , would you send your family to vote knowing it is a life or death situation and that they would not come back tomorrow ?
i believe in the elections and have voted .
the faith of the iraqi people has been tested many times and some are prepared to sacrifice their life for the vote and a better future for their people .
husain , baghdad , iraq i think the national election in iraq is very important to the iraqi population .
i hope all areas of the country will be represented despite hardships the voters will be going through .
as i read your article today on the positive kurdish response to the election and for the high hopes they have for a new iraq it confirms my belief there is an excellent chance for iraq people to be better off tomorrow than yesterday .
i encourage everyone that is eligible to vote and then support the government that is elected .
stephen segall , united states as in my own country , south africa , we see the potential for a new , dynamic and free country of citizens who put the interests of the common good above their own separatist and racist tendencies .
as long as we can stop george bush from making pronouncements about ' crusades ' and the like , there is a chance that iraqis see this as a historic moment for themselves .
let love and peace triumph over hate , fear and despair .
andy lawrence , united arab emirates i am an iraqi living in the us .
i watch the news and i ca n't quit thinking of what 's going on in my country .
i believe that a bright future for iraq requires great efforts and sacrifices , and today , the election day , is the time to show those sacrifices by going to vote no matter what !
peace be upon everyone that is going to vote .
mohammed , western new york , usa for children of iraqi exiles , the most important events in our lives took place before we were even born .
today , on the first day of out-of-country voting , this is no longer true .
as an iraqi-american born and raised in the us , i plan to vote in the ocv program today .
i have never been to iraq , but both my parents are iraqi and it has always been the basis of my identity .
i am proud to vote and be a part of the future or iraq .
i have tremendous admiration for the election log contributors who are brave enough to risk their lives to fight a state of perpetual inconsequence .
babylonia marcus , washington , dc , usa it 's time for the rest of the world to get behind this project to get iraq back on its feet .
regardless of past disagreement on the war - what alternative is there ? ; i think its a shame that much of the passion on the issue of iraq is spent on ' disagreeing ' with america and arguing about the questionable justification of the war and not on unequivocally condemning the atrocities being committed by the insurgents .
olawande kasumu , lagos , nigeria to ian stephenson : you said north american , that would include you , since you are from canada .
blissful is not what most people have in mind when it comes to iraq .
the fact that they are able to vote is somewhat of a miracle all by itself , is n't it ?
whether it is in the middle of the " war zone " -lrb- as you put it -rrb- or not .
how many of these people are thankful they can vote at all ?
how many died for one person to vote ?
if you had been bound up for 50 years and suddenly freedom was at your door , would n't you pay the price , no matter what the cost ?
tez , st louis , mo us i 'd like to answer ian who posted earlier .
voting in the middle of a war zone is like going out in the morning to college or work place and facing the prospect of a suicide bomber in the way -lrb- frightening but has to be done .
as someone said on this site , voting is voting against violence , not particularly for a certain party or group of persons , but against intimidations by certain people .
i 'm no idealist and i sure hope to survive this period and its aftermath , but i do know that by voting i would tell those certain people that i do n't like their way of thinking and that they do n't speak for the rest of the sunnis -lrb- which i am one of .
mays , baghdad , iraq just want to say to all iraqis out there who may be reading this - good luck for this weekend !
i hope that , despite the probable violence in some areas , the election progresses iraq and you all go a little further down the road to peace , stability and a good life .
the " north american ideals " a canadian contributor derided on this page , are not just north american but global desires for peace , justice and a good life for all our families , friends and neighbours .
that 's something worth voting for !
rachelle , london , uk the elections will not be a magic bullet to fix all the problems in iraq , but it is a start whether they are dodging bullets and bombers or not .
to hear iraqi nationals who live outside the ' death triangle ' describe how they feel about the vote is optimistic , blissful , and hopeful .
the troublemakers are angry that they are losing their control , so they create havoc and murder as a form of social control through fear .
i seriously doubt the elections will be legitimate since so many are being used as pawns in the game of fear , but in the long run i have faith in the iraqi people to show the rest of the middle east how good it can be to have that rare freedom of a constitution protecting their basic human rights .

co-proxamol , used by thousands for conditions such as back pain , will be phased out over the next year or two .
people do not need to come off the drug yet , and should discuss their treatment with their gp , said the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency .
charities criticised the move saying it left many patients with very few options of effective pain relief .
suicide risk the mhra is sending letters to gps informing them of the decision .
there is no need for panic or concern .
chairman of the csm professor gordon duff what will relieve my pain now ?
data shows fatal overdoses due to co-proxamol are the second most frequent means of suicide with prescribed drugs in england and wales , accounting for up to 400 deaths each year .
the risk of death associated with co-proxamol overdose seems to be higher than for either tricyclic antidepressants or paracetamol .
the drug is a combination analgesic containing paracetamol and the opioid dextropropoxyphene and is available only with a prescription .
but some say co-proxamol is no better than full strength paracetamol at relieving pain and is known to be very toxic in overdose .
for this reason , the committee on safety of medicines , an independent expert body that advises the government on medicines , was asked to look at the risks and benefits of co-proxamol .
bad news measures have already been taken to address concerns about the medicine , including making advice more prominent on the packaging .
but they have failed to reduce the number of fatalities , according to experts .
chairman of the csm professor gordon duff said : " co-proxamol will be phased out of the market place gradually to give patients time to discuss their treatment with their doctor and change to a suitable alternative .
" there is no need for panic or concern and if patients have been taking co-proxamol continuously for a long time they should not stop without consulting their doctor . "
neil betteridge , of arthritis care , said the move was bad news for people with arthritis , particularly given the recent safety concerns about other painkillers such as cox-2 inhibitors .
" the withdrawal of co-proxamol leaves many people with very few options for the safe and effective management of their pain .
" although we understand the mhra 's concern , we are of the view that a stringent package of prescribing advice , packaging changes and other warnings should limit the risks of co-proxamol being misused , " he said .
a spokeswoman from the arthritis research campaign said : " co-proxamol is a very effective and much safer than some of the other painkillers .
" it 's incredibly bad news . "
it is estimated that 1.7 million gp patients per year receive 7.5 million prescriptions for co-proxamol .
your views : as a member of the hm forces with 31 years service i have been prescribed co-proxomol for a number of years for severe back pain .
earlier last year " vioxx " was withdrawn , which was prescribed for the arthritic development of my back injuries .
now i will be left with little relief for the pain i have suffered through the wear and tear of military service since pre-falklands campaign .
a review of pain management , without co-proxomol , may now prevent me completing a full 35 year career .
the risk must surely be the decision of the gp .
frank , nottingham uk co-proxamol cause respiratory depression in even mild overdose , resulting in death .
i was trained not to prescribe it for this reason back in the 80s .
over the last 20 years i have personally seen several unnecessary deaths from it .
i shall be glad when it is gone .
gp in telford , telford shropshire this is terrible news for patients with chronic conditions i.e arthritis following the recent withdrawal of cox2 inhibitors .
co proxamol is certainly a lot more effective than paracetamol in patients with chronic pain .
of course the last possible drugs to change patients to are codein based drugs i.e co-codamol and co-dydramol .
following the withdrawal of co-proxamol they will predictably lead the suicide tables in the future and will then also get withdrawn .
arthritis sufferers often take 8 tablets per day , more than 200 per month .
limiting prescriptions to low numbers of any pain killer to prevent suicide in few may mean patients have to come to the surgery every few days and doctors have to sign prescriptions every few days.on the other hand people determined to commit suicide will find other means to do so .
dr m k , windsor it has great brand loyalty with some patients robert u , darlington england co-proxamol certainly has been popular with patients although scientific studies have repeatedly failed to demonstrate a significant benefit over other painkillers .
i think the problem with co-proxamol is not that it is an effective agent for deliberate suicide , i take the point that if you 're going to do it then probably you 'll find a way , but accidental death .
in combination with alcohol in particular the lethal dose is alarmingly small and much less than with other equally effective painkillers .
as gps we 've been trying to get the number of people on this medication down .
however , for reasons that are hard to explain in purely scientific terms it has great brand loyalty with some patients .
but i think the risk of someone killing themselves , especially unintentionally , with this medication is too high and i applaud the regulatory authorities for taking this action .
robert u , darlington england i find co-proxamol far more effective at pain relief than plain paracetemol .
i do not intend to misuse it .
i can not see why i should be deprived of its beneficial effects , because some people might use it for suicidal purposes .
if they are intent on suicide , there are plenty of other available drugs to do the job anyway .
john samuel , sidcup , kent , , uk this is a totally nonsensical decision taken by our ' nannying ' masters citing grounds that many will find derisory when we all know that anyone contemplating suicide could do so quite easily by using similar drugs.i have been taking co-proxamol for over 10 years to effectively alleviate back pain that no other drug seemed to be able to do .
i do n't know quite how this excellent drug will be replaced for my particular condition .
mrs b.e.b , marlborough , england there 's still a multitude of choice out there , there is no need to fuss .
what about co-codamol or co-dydramol they are both just as effective without any such fears - not to mention stronger drugs like tramadol .
the last thing we need is another media circus about this ben morton , manchester , england i have used co-proxamol for many years to manage my back pain .
i have tried other pain relievers all of which have given me various nasty side effects , this along with the fact that i am allergic to aspirin means i have very few options open to me .
if i can no longer get co-proxamol and can not find a suitable alternative , it will affect my quality of life and may even lead to me having time work sick with back pain -lrb- something that i have managed to avoid in the past -rrb- .
sam , derbyshire , england c0-proxamol is a nasty drug which should have been taken off the market years ago .
ten tablets can be a fatal dose , and the overdose is difficult to treat because of the respiratory depressant effects of the dextropopoxyphene component.the truly frightening thing about this medicine is the paradoxical reaction , leading to sudden death , if the drug is taken with alcohol.good riddance .
jim mckie , livingston , scotland i have been taking co-proxamol for about 5 years now for back pain .
i do not abuse this medication and only take them when necessary but my body accepts this painkiller with no side effects which is quite rare for me .
it is productive in that it works and does not make me drowsy .
i shall be concerned now that i will have to eventually ' try out ' other drugs to find one that will work efficiently .
i do sympathise with those people who attempt or succeed in taking their lives but i would have thought that they will find an alternative drug to do so and that taking this drug off the market will not bring down the statistics .
rita bridgman , essex , uk this is bad news for patients and reduces choice jason powell , fife , scotland this is bad news for patients and reduces choice .
i have a chronic illness and co-proxamol was found to be the most effective pain killer to control the pain , seeing paracetamol has little effect and i am not allowed to take an asprin based drug .
i am sure there will be lots of people in the same situation who basically will have to go back to square one again and find effective pain relief .
the risk of suicide might be increased but surely there would be an underlying mental health problem for a person to contemplate this , and if they are determined they could use any number of other " safer " drugs such as paracetamol it 's self .
jason powell , fife , scotland any tablet taken in doses higher than those prescribed could kill .
is all medication to be withdrawn ?
or perhaps each dose handed out as required as in hospital ?
this is a typical knee-jerk reaction , and i write as someone who works in health -lrb- not a drug company i hasten to add -rrb- !
co-proxamol taken in the correct doses as prescribed by your doctor is safe .
as few as 9 paracetamol tablets can cause permanent and potentially fatal damage to one 's liver - shall we ban these too ?
polly s , lichfield uk in my 20 years experience as a gp , co-proxamol is certainly more effective than full dose paracetamol at relieving pain .
once removed from the market , patients will then resort to one of its many cousins , which will then become the next most common cause of suicide deaths !
i wonder : could one dare to call it conspiracy ?
a gp in sevenoaks , sevenoaks , england if someone wants to overdose they will do it regardless lisa lyons-wilson , london if someone wants to overdose they will do it regardless.withdrawing the drug is paramount to treating us like naughty school children.what about all those that responsibly use the drug and benefit vastly from it ? as it is a prescription drug , are there not enough checks in place to try and avoid it being prescribed to those who have suicidal tendencies ?
should n't the onus be put on gp 's to take a little more care when prescribing this drug , rather then withdrawing it from mass use ?
whoever came up with this plan has too much time on their hands .
lisa lyons-wilson , london i take co-proxamol tablets -lrb- and have been doing for many years -rrb- .
they are far more effective at relieving pain than ordinary paracetamols .
surely if a person is hell bent on committing suicide then they will do so by any means available not just by taking co-proxamol .
this appears to be just another case of people been wrapped in cotton wool by the nanny state !
julie neale , bradford , england nothing else helps with my pain and they have the audacity to tell me i can no longer have this as a pain reliever .
perhaps offering the tablets in strips of 8 instead of 10 -lrb- 8 being the maximum per day dosage -rrb- would help people remember whether or not they have reached their limit .
those who want to overdose can do so as easily on over the counter paracetamol anyway .
co-proxomol has that one extra ingredient which seems to work for me .
but then i can still count .

co-proxamol , used by thousands for conditions such as back pain , will be phased out over the next year or two .
people do not need to come off the drug yet , and should discuss their treatment with their gp , said the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency .
charities criticised the move saying it left many patients with very few options of effective pain relief .
suicide risk the mhra is sending letters to gps informing them of the decision .
there is no need for panic or concern .
chairman of the csm professor gordon duff what will relieve my pain now ?
data shows fatal overdoses due to co-proxamol are the second most frequent means of suicide with prescribed drugs in england and wales , accounting for up to 400 deaths each year .
the risk of death associated with co-proxamol overdose seems to be higher than for either tricyclic antidepressants or paracetamol .
the drug is a combination analgesic containing paracetamol and the opioid dextropropoxyphene and is available only with a prescription .
but some say co-proxamol is no better than full strength paracetamol at relieving pain and is known to be very toxic in overdose .
for this reason , the committee on safety of medicines , an independent expert body that advises the government on medicines , was asked to look at the risks and benefits of co-proxamol .
bad news measures have already been taken to address concerns about the medicine , including making advice more prominent on the packaging .
but they have failed to reduce the number of fatalities , according to experts .
chairman of the csm professor gordon duff said : " co-proxamol will be phased out of the market place gradually to give patients time to discuss their treatment with their doctor and change to a suitable alternative .
" there is no need for panic or concern and if patients have been taking co-proxamol continuously for a long time they should not stop without consulting their doctor . "
neil betteridge , of arthritis care , said the move was bad news for people with arthritis , particularly given the recent safety concerns about other painkillers such as cox-2 inhibitors .
" the withdrawal of co-proxamol leaves many people with very few options for the safe and effective management of their pain .
" although we understand the mhra 's concern , we are of the view that a stringent package of prescribing advice , packaging changes and other warnings should limit the risks of co-proxamol being misused , " he said .
a spokeswoman from the arthritis research campaign said : " co-proxamol is a very effective and much safer than some of the other painkillers .
" it 's incredibly bad news . "
it is estimated that 1.7 million gp patients per year receive 7.5 million prescriptions for co-proxamol .
your views : as a member of the hm forces with 31 years service i have been prescribed co-proxomol for a number of years for severe back pain .
earlier last year " vioxx " was withdrawn , which was prescribed for the arthritic development of my back injuries .
now i will be left with little relief for the pain i have suffered through the wear and tear of military service since pre-falklands campaign .

co-proxamol , used by thousands for conditions such as back pain , will be phased out over the next year or two .
people do not need to come off the drug yet , and should discuss their treatment with their gp , said the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency .
charities criticised the move saying it left many patients with very few options of effective pain relief .
suicide risk the mhra is sending letters to gps informing them of the decision .
there is no need for panic or concern .
chairman of the csm professor gordon duff what will relieve my pain now ?
data shows fatal overdoses due to co-proxamol are the second most frequent means of suicide with prescribed drugs in england and wales , accounting for up to 400 deaths each year .
the risk of death associated with co-proxamol overdose seems to be higher than for either tricyclic antidepressants or paracetamol .
the drug is a combination analgesic containing paracetamol and the opioid dextropropoxyphene and is available only with a prescription .
but some say co-proxamol is no better than full strength paracetamol at relieving pain and is known to be very toxic in overdose .
for this reason , the committee on safety of medicines , an independent expert body that advises the government on medicines , was asked to look at the risks and benefits of co-proxamol .
bad news measures have already been taken to address concerns about the medicine , including making advice more prominent on the packaging .
but they have failed to reduce the number of fatalities , according to experts .
chairman of the csm professor gordon duff said : " co-proxamol will be phased out of the market place gradually to give patients time to discuss their treatment with their doctor and change to a suitable alternative .
" there is no need for panic or concern and if patients have been taking co-proxamol continuously for a long time they should not stop without consulting their doctor . "
neil betteridge , of arthritis care , said the move was bad news for people with arthritis , particularly given the recent safety concerns about other painkillers such as cox-2 inhibitors .
" the withdrawal of co-proxamol leaves many people with very few options for the safe and effective management of their pain .
" although we understand the mhra 's concern , we are of the view that a stringent package of prescribing advice , packaging changes and other warnings should limit the risks of co-proxamol being misused , " he said .
a spokeswoman from the arthritis research campaign said : " co-proxamol is a very effective and much safer than some of the other painkillers .
" it 's incredibly bad news . "
it is estimated that 1.7 million gp patients per year receive 7.5 million prescriptions for co-proxamol .
your views : as a member of the hm forces with 31 years service i have been prescribed co-proxomol for a number of years for severe back pain .
earlier last year " vioxx " was withdrawn , which was prescribed for the arthritic development of my back injuries .
now i will be left with little relief for the pain i have suffered through the wear and tear of military service since pre-falklands campaign .
a review of pain management , without co-proxomol , may now prevent me completing a full 35 year career .
the risk must surely be the decision of the gp .
frank , nottingham uk co-proxamol cause respiratory depression in even mild overdose , resulting in death .
i was trained not to prescribe it for this reason back in the 80s .
over the last 20 years i have personally seen several unnecessary deaths from it .
i shall be glad when it is gone .
gp in telford , telford shropshire this is terrible news for patients with chronic conditions i.e arthritis following the recent withdrawal of cox2 inhibitors .
co proxamol is certainly a lot more effective than paracetamol in patients with chronic pain .
of course the last possible drugs to change patients to are codein based drugs i.e co-codamol and co-dydramol .
following the withdrawal of co-proxamol they will predictably lead the suicide tables in the future and will then also get withdrawn .
arthritis sufferers often take 8 tablets per day , more than 200 per month .
limiting prescriptions to low numbers of any pain killer to prevent suicide in few may mean patients have to come to the surgery every few days and doctors have to sign prescriptions every few days.on the other hand people determined to commit suicide will find other means to do so .
dr m k , windsor it has great brand loyalty with some patients robert u , darlington england co-proxamol certainly has been popular with patients although scientific studies have repeatedly failed to demonstrate a significant benefit over other painkillers .
i think the problem with co-proxamol is not that it is an effective agent for deliberate suicide , i take the point that if you 're going to do it then probably you 'll find a way , but accidental death .
in combination with alcohol in particular the lethal dose is alarmingly small and much less than with other equally effective painkillers .
as gps we 've been trying to get the number of people on this medication down .
however , for reasons that are hard to explain in purely scientific terms it has great brand loyalty with some patients .
but i think the risk of someone killing themselves , especially unintentionally , with this medication is too high and i applaud the regulatory authorities for taking this action .
robert u , darlington england i find co-proxamol far more effective at pain relief than plain paracetemol .
i do not intend to misuse it .
i can not see why i should be deprived of its beneficial effects , because some people might use it for suicidal purposes .
if they are intent on suicide , there are plenty of other available drugs to do the job anyway .
john samuel , sidcup , kent , , uk this is a totally nonsensical decision taken by our ' nannying ' masters citing grounds that many will find derisory when we all know that anyone contemplating suicide could do so quite easily by using similar drugs.i have been taking co-proxamol for over 10 years to effectively alleviate back pain that no other drug seemed to be able to do .
i do n't know quite how this excellent drug will be replaced for my particular condition .
mrs b.e.b , marlborough , england there 's still a multitude of choice out there , there is no need to fuss .
what about co-codamol or co-dydramol they are both just as effective without any such fears - not to mention stronger drugs like tramadol .
the last thing we need is another media circus about this ben morton , manchester , england i have used co-proxamol for many years to manage my back pain .
i have tried other pain relievers all of which have given me various nasty side effects , this along with the fact that i am allergic to aspirin means i have very few options open to me .
if i can no longer get co-proxamol and can not find a suitable alternative , it will affect my quality of life and may even lead to me having time work sick with back pain -lrb- something that i have managed to avoid in the past -rrb- .
sam , derbyshire , england c0-proxamol is a nasty drug which should have been taken off the market years ago .
ten tablets can be a fatal dose , and the overdose is difficult to treat because of the respiratory depressant effects of the dextropopoxyphene component.the truly frightening thing about this medicine is the paradoxical reaction , leading to sudden death , if the drug is taken with alcohol.good riddance .
jim mckie , livingston , scotland i have been taking co-proxamol for about 5 years now for back pain .
i do not abuse this medication and only take them when necessary but my body accepts this painkiller with no side effects which is quite rare for me .
it is productive in that it works and does not make me drowsy .
i shall be concerned now that i will have to eventually ' try out ' other drugs to find one that will work efficiently .
i do sympathise with those people who attempt or succeed in taking their lives but i would have thought that they will find an alternative drug to do so and that taking this drug off the market will not bring down the statistics .
rita bridgman , essex , uk this is bad news for patients and reduces choice jason powell , fife , scotland this is bad news for patients and reduces choice .
i have a chronic illness and co-proxamol was found to be the most effective pain killer to control the pain , seeing paracetamol has little effect and i am not allowed to take an asprin based drug .
i am sure there will be lots of people in the same situation who basically will have to go back to square one again and find effective pain relief .
the risk of suicide might be increased but surely there would be an underlying mental health problem for a person to contemplate this , and if they are determined they could use any number of other " safer " drugs such as paracetamol it 's self .
jason powell , fife , scotland any tablet taken in doses higher than those prescribed could kill .
is all medication to be withdrawn ?
or perhaps each dose handed out as required as in hospital ?
this is a typical knee-jerk reaction , and i write as someone who works in health -lrb- not a drug company i hasten to add -rrb- !
co-proxamol taken in the correct doses as prescribed by your doctor is safe .
as few as 9 paracetamol tablets can cause permanent and potentially fatal damage to one 's liver - shall we ban these too ?
polly s , lichfield uk in my 20 years experience as a gp , co-proxamol is certainly more effective than full dose paracetamol at relieving pain .
once removed from the market , patients will then resort to one of its many cousins , which will then become the next most common cause of suicide deaths !
i wonder : could one dare to call it conspiracy ?
a gp in sevenoaks , sevenoaks , england if someone wants to overdose they will do it regardless lisa lyons-wilson , london if someone wants to overdose they will do it regardless.withdrawing the drug is paramount to treating us like naughty school children.what about all those that responsibly use the drug and benefit vastly from it ? as it is a prescription drug , are there not enough checks in place to try and avoid it being prescribed to those who have suicidal tendencies ?
should n't the onus be put on gp 's to take a little more care when prescribing this drug , rather then withdrawing it from mass use ?
whoever came up with this plan has too much time on their hands .
lisa lyons-wilson , london i take co-proxamol tablets -lrb- and have been doing for many years -rrb- .
they are far more effective at relieving pain than ordinary paracetamols .
surely if a person is hell bent on committing suicide then they will do so by any means available not just by taking co-proxamol .
this appears to be just another case of people been wrapped in cotton wool by the nanny state !
julie neale , bradford , england nothing else helps with my pain and they have the audacity to tell me i can no longer have this as a pain reliever .
perhaps offering the tablets in strips of 8 instead of 10 -lrb- 8 being the maximum per day dosage -rrb- would help people remember whether or not they have reached their limit .
those who want to overdose can do so as easily on over the counter paracetamol anyway .
co-proxomol has that one extra ingredient which seems to work for me .
but then i can still count .
