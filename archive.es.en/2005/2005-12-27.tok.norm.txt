18 , german archaeologist susanne osthoff said her kidnappers were not criminals . speaking to doha-based satellite channel al-jazeera on monday , osthoff , 43 , said her captors told her not to be afraid as her kidnapping was " politically motivated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parliamentary ruprecht polenz wants osthoff to change her mind " do not be afraid .
we do not harm women or children and you are a muslim , " she quoted them as saying . " i was so happy to know that i had not fallen into the hands of criminals , " she said . little understanding yet osthoff 's proclaimed intention to return to iraq to continue her humanitarian and professional work has drawn the wrath of the german government . " it is regretful that ms. osthoff is not following the appeal of the german government not to return to irak , " said ruprecht polenz , president of the german parliamentary committee on foreign affairs . " she is precisely the one who should clearly see the risk of such a decision , " said polenz . german officials seem particularly irked by osthoff 's decision in view of the government effort that went into organizing her release .
only eight days after gaining her release , politicians are calling for levying a financial penalty as a consequence if osthoff should ignore their warnings and return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is also urging osthoff to stay away from iraq " after the intensive efforts of all parties involved over a period of three weeks in the end led to her being released , i would have little understanding if ms. osthoff found herself again in a dangerous situation , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier " i am appealing to ms. osthoff to distance herself from the plans of going back to iraq , " steinmeier said .
and spd parliamentarian lothar mark said osthoff should realize " the german tax payer would not finance another release effort should she once again be taken hostage . " osthoff herself has not responded to the german government 's criticism of her plans , but claudia roth , the head of the green party , has said she can understand that someone as dedicated as osthoff to helping the people of iraq would want to return . " in our democracy , it is good and right that people can make free decisions . ...
ms. osthoff should decide for herself what she wants to do , " roth said in the wednesday edition of the daily handelsblatt . noble intentions osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , said her captors demanded german humanitarian aid for iraq 's sunni arabs and stated clearly they did not want a ransom , but instead sought humanitarian aid for building schools and hospitals . she described her captors as " poor people " and said she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " she said she lived with her captors in a clean place and that they treated her " well . " but she repeated more than once that she " was sold , " without making clear what she meant .
she also expressed her shock at berlin 's failure to contact her captors . " i could not believe that the germans had not made any contact , " with her kidnapers she said , describing her feelings during captivity . 24 days in captivity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sign in osthoff 's hometown reads " susanne osthoff is free again !
thank you ! "
osthoff and her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani were seized on nov .
25 in iraq 's northwester nineveh province .
osthoff was freed on dec .
18 . she was the first german national to be kidnapped in iraq , and many questions remain unanswered about her ordeal .
according to german press reports in november , shortly after osthoff was siezed , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for her release . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen , although not on german soil . a picture has emerged of osthoff in the german press as a dedicated humanitarian and historian who was well aware of the risks of life in iraq but remained because of her close ties to people there . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany releases hezbollah hijacker wanted by us germany has quietly released a jailed hezbollah member wanted by the us for killing an american navy diver .

in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens . " ironically , britain 's critics accuse it of just that : failing to draw conclusions to recognized problems . terror laws , development aid , expansion success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the eu 's policy was dictated by the july terror attacks in london but blair did manage to cross some things off his list . after july 's bombing attacks in london , the british presidency got started by focusing on combating terrorism .
blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .
" but it does not have to . " constitution leads to european crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu practically stopped for the summer after the constitution was rejected wrangling with crisis after the french and dutch both rejected the european constitution in late summer , the british presidency wanted simply to ignore autumn 's traditional meeting of eu heads of state .
in the end though , blair invited his colleagues to hampton court outside of london to discuss europe 's social model , circumventing discussion of the eu constitution and causing european diplomats and parliamentarians to accuse london of twiddling its thumbs . rather than submitting a reformed draft of the 2007-2013 budget , britain shocked the european commission and member states alike with a barebones proposal to the detriment of the bloc 's poorer new member states . although normally blair 's friend , eu commission president jose barroso uttered a curt phrase in response : " it is simply not enough . " budget deal ends presidency on a high note worse still , to many european observers , the british proposal left intact its own cherished budget rebate , making the chances of reaching an agreement shrink with every passing minute . " they complain about a situation … they themselves brought about , " said martin schulz , head of the european parliament 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cool-headedness , and cash , is credited with negotiation of a budget agreement it was not until german chancellor angela merkel , at her first eu finance meeting , negotiated a compromise in a grueling late-night session that britain said it was prepared to give back part of the contentious rebate - but only after france agreed to allow evaluation of the eu agriculture policy it benefits from . while some called it a compromise of the lowest common denominator , tony blair insisted he was pleased with the deal . " it is clear to me that the budget we agreed to in the early hours of saturday is not the right budget for the future of europe , " he said .
" but for the meantime , until we achieve larger reforms , we will give the new member states control over their financial perspectives .

adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .
many commentators and sections of the media paint a bleak picture of german society in graphic terms words like " geburtenkollaps -lrb- birth collapse -rrb- and " gebärstreik -lrb- birthing-strike . -rrb- " it 's prompted scientists such as jay winter at the american university of yale , to urge germans to " lower the ideological temperature of these debates .

" europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .

it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .

seen from europe , the recent tsunamis hit countries half a world away .
but european experts say it would be wrong to think that a tsunami could n't happen here , and say an eu-wide early warning system is needed .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .

21 , 2005 -rrb- abducted german says no payment from us a german citizen of lebanese origin , mistakenly abducted and detained by the cia , said friday he had not received any payment from the united states or been asked to keep quiet about the affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.12.2005 " iran must send different signals " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran has sparked international migivings about its nuclear ambitions the eu and iran want to reopen talks in january over teheran 's nuclear program .
dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

" i am strongly betting on education and knowledge here , " herweg said . worship is n ' t just a matter for me n for herweg , no religion is fundamentally misogynistic .

a striking example for women 's discrimination in religion is their exclusion from the priesthood , herweg said . " there is still the idea in the jewish orthodox tradition that public worship is a matter for men , " she said .
progressive and reformist-liberal jewish communities do allow women rabbis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency europe -pipe- 27.12.2005 british eu presidency tenure fails to impress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair left the presidency without achieving many of the goals he set as britain 's six-month rotation as european union president draws to a close , observers look back on the past half year , which was marked by a series of attempts to reform the eu .
in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens . " ironically , britain 's critics accuse it of just that : failing to draw conclusions to recognized problems . terror laws , development aid , expansion success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the eu 's policy was dictated by the july terror attacks in london but blair did manage to cross some things off his list . after july 's bombing attacks in london , the british presidency got started by focusing on combating terrorism .
blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .
" but it does not have to . " constitution leads to european crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu practically stopped for the summer after the constitution was rejected wrangling with crisis after the french and dutch both rejected the european constitution in late summer , the british presidency wanted simply to ignore autumn 's traditional meeting of eu heads of state .
in the end though , blair invited his colleagues to hampton court outside of london to discuss europe 's social model , circumventing discussion of the eu constitution and causing european diplomats and parliamentarians to accuse london of twiddling its thumbs . rather than submitting a reformed draft of the 2007-2013 budget , britain shocked the european commission and member states alike with a barebones proposal to the detriment of the bloc 's poorer new member states . although normally blair 's friend , eu commission president jose barroso uttered a curt phrase in response : " it is simply not enough . " budget deal ends presidency on a high note worse still , to many european observers , the british proposal left intact its own cherished budget rebate , making the chances of reaching an agreement shrink with every passing minute . " they complain about a situation … they themselves brought about , " said martin schulz , head of the european parliament 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cool-headedness , and cash , is credited with negotiation of a budget agreement it was not until german chancellor angela merkel , at her first eu finance meeting , negotiated a compromise in a grueling late-night session that britain said it was prepared to give back part of the contentious rebate - but only after france agreed to allow evaluation of the eu agriculture policy it benefits from . while some called it a compromise of the lowest common denominator , tony blair insisted he was pleased with the deal . " it is clear to me that the budget we agreed to in the early hours of saturday is not the right budget for the future of europe , " he said .
" but for the meantime , until we achieve larger reforms , we will give the new member states control over their financial perspectives .

in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .

blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .

" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.12.2005 in war on terror , how far is too far ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new german passports now include biometric data the affair over secret cia prisoner transports in europe has revived a partisan debate within germany over internal security .
what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .

21 , 2005 -rrb- abducted german says no payment from us a german citizen of lebanese origin , mistakenly abducted and detained by the cia , said friday he had not received any payment from the united states or been asked to keep quiet about the affair .

and spd parliamentarian lothar mark said osthoff should realize " the german tax payer would not finance another release effort should she once again be taken hostage . " osthoff herself has not responded to the german government 's criticism of her plans , but claudia roth , the head of the green party , has said she can understand that someone as dedicated as osthoff to helping the people of iraq would want to return . " in our democracy , it is good and right that people can make free decisions . ...
ms. osthoff should decide for herself what she wants to do , " roth said in the wednesday edition of the daily handelsblatt . noble intentions osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , said her captors demanded german humanitarian aid for iraq 's sunni arabs and stated clearly they did not want a ransom , but instead sought humanitarian aid for building schools and hospitals . she described her captors as " poor people " and said she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " she said she lived with her captors in a clean place and that they treated her " well . " but she repeated more than once that she " was sold , " without making clear what she meant .
she also expressed her shock at berlin 's failure to contact her captors . " i could not believe that the germans had not made any contact , " with her kidnapers she said , describing her feelings during captivity . 24 days in captivity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sign in osthoff 's hometown reads " susanne osthoff is free again !
thank you ! "
osthoff and her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani were seized on nov .
25 in iraq 's northwester nineveh province .
osthoff was freed on dec .
18 . she was the first german national to be kidnapped in iraq , and many questions remain unanswered about her ordeal .
according to german press reports in november , shortly after osthoff was siezed , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for her release . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen , although not on german soil . a picture has emerged of osthoff in the german press as a dedicated humanitarian and historian who was well aware of the risks of life in iraq but remained because of her close ties to people there . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany releases hezbollah hijacker wanted by us germany has quietly released a jailed hezbollah member wanted by the us for killing an american navy diver .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .

but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .

but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.12.2005 germany calls for tsunami early warning system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buouys like this one would be key to a european warning system one year after deadly tidal waves decimated parts of asia , germany is seeking to establish an early flood-warning system for europe 's coastline . " europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .
many commentators and sections of the media paint a bleak picture of german society in graphic terms words like " geburtenkollaps -lrb- birth collapse -rrb- and " gebärstreik -lrb- birthing-strike . -rrb- " it 's prompted scientists such as jay winter at the american university of yale , to urge germans to " lower the ideological temperature of these debates .

the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .
many commentators and sections of the media paint a bleak picture of german society in graphic terms words like " geburtenkollaps -lrb- birth collapse -rrb- and " gebärstreik -lrb- birthing-strike . -rrb- " it 's prompted scientists such as jay winter at the american university of yale , to urge germans to " lower the ideological temperature of these debates .

" europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .
many commentators and sections of the media paint a bleak picture of german society in graphic terms words like " geburtenkollaps -lrb- birth collapse -rrb- and " gebärstreik -lrb- birthing-strike . -rrb- " it 's prompted scientists such as jay winter at the american university of yale , to urge germans to " lower the ideological temperature of these debates .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .

" europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany debates the family fewer european couples tying the knot german women take the rap for declining birth rate opinion : mother 's day is n't what it used to be new parenting legislation focuses on fathers germany -pipe- 27.12.2005 germany 's population problems no longer taboo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a birth rate of just 1.4 percent the german government wants to combat the falling birth rate with better family policies .
tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .
many commentators and sections of the media paint a bleak picture of german society in graphic terms words like " geburtenkollaps -lrb- birth collapse -rrb- and " gebärstreik -lrb- birthing-strike . -rrb- " it 's prompted scientists such as jay winter at the american university of yale , to urge germans to " lower the ideological temperature of these debates .

18 , german archaeologist susanne osthoff said her kidnappers were not criminals . speaking to doha-based satellite channel al-jazeera on monday , osthoff , 43 , said her captors told her not to be afraid as her kidnapping was " politically motivated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parliamentary ruprecht polenz wants osthoff to change her mind " do not be afraid .
we do not harm women or children and you are a muslim , " she quoted them as saying . " i was so happy to know that i had not fallen into the hands of criminals , " she said . little understanding yet osthoff 's proclaimed intention to return to iraq to continue her humanitarian and professional work has drawn the wrath of the german government . " it is regretful that ms. osthoff is not following the appeal of the german government not to return to irak , " said ruprecht polenz , president of the german parliamentary committee on foreign affairs . " she is precisely the one who should clearly see the risk of such a decision , " said polenz . german officials seem particularly irked by osthoff 's decision in view of the government effort that went into organizing her release .
only eight days after gaining her release , politicians are calling for levying a financial penalty as a consequence if osthoff should ignore their warnings and return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is also urging osthoff to stay away from iraq " after the intensive efforts of all parties involved over a period of three weeks in the end led to her being released , i would have little understanding if ms. osthoff found herself again in a dangerous situation , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier " i am appealing to ms. osthoff to distance herself from the plans of going back to iraq , " steinmeier said .
and spd parliamentarian lothar mark said osthoff should realize " the german tax payer would not finance another release effort should she once again be taken hostage . " osthoff herself has not responded to the german government 's criticism of her plans , but claudia roth , the head of the green party , has said she can understand that someone as dedicated as osthoff to helping the people of iraq would want to return . " in our democracy , it is good and right that people can make free decisions . ...
ms. osthoff should decide for herself what she wants to do , " roth said in the wednesday edition of the daily handelsblatt . noble intentions osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , said her captors demanded german humanitarian aid for iraq 's sunni arabs and stated clearly they did not want a ransom , but instead sought humanitarian aid for building schools and hospitals . she described her captors as " poor people " and said she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans .

18 , german archaeologist susanne osthoff said her kidnappers were not criminals . speaking to doha-based satellite channel al-jazeera on monday , osthoff , 43 , said her captors told her not to be afraid as her kidnapping was " politically motivated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parliamentary ruprecht polenz wants osthoff to change her mind " do not be afraid .
we do not harm women or children and you are a muslim , " she quoted them as saying . " i was so happy to know that i had not fallen into the hands of criminals , " she said . little understanding yet osthoff 's proclaimed intention to return to iraq to continue her humanitarian and professional work has drawn the wrath of the german government . " it is regretful that ms. osthoff is not following the appeal of the german government not to return to irak , " said ruprecht polenz , president of the german parliamentary committee on foreign affairs . " she is precisely the one who should clearly see the risk of such a decision , " said polenz . german officials seem particularly irked by osthoff 's decision in view of the government effort that went into organizing her release .
only eight days after gaining her release , politicians are calling for levying a financial penalty as a consequence if osthoff should ignore their warnings and return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is also urging osthoff to stay away from iraq " after the intensive efforts of all parties involved over a period of three weeks in the end led to her being released , i would have little understanding if ms. osthoff found herself again in a dangerous situation , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier " i am appealing to ms. osthoff to distance herself from the plans of going back to iraq , " steinmeier said .
and spd parliamentarian lothar mark said osthoff should realize " the german tax payer would not finance another release effort should she once again be taken hostage . " osthoff herself has not responded to the german government 's criticism of her plans , but claudia roth , the head of the green party , has said she can understand that someone as dedicated as osthoff to helping the people of iraq would want to return . " in our democracy , it is good and right that people can make free decisions . ...
ms. osthoff should decide for herself what she wants to do , " roth said in the wednesday edition of the daily handelsblatt . noble intentions osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , said her captors demanded german humanitarian aid for iraq 's sunni arabs and stated clearly they did not want a ransom , but instead sought humanitarian aid for building schools and hospitals . she described her captors as " poor people " and said she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " she said she lived with her captors in a clean place and that they treated her " well . " but she repeated more than once that she " was sold , " without making clear what she meant .
she also expressed her shock at berlin 's failure to contact her captors .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.12.2005 germany calls for tsunami early warning system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buouys like this one would be key to a european warning system one year after deadly tidal waves decimated parts of asia , germany is seeking to establish an early flood-warning system for europe 's coastline . " europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .
-lrb- dec .
26 , 2005 -rrb- german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .
many commentators and sections of the media paint a bleak picture of german society in graphic terms words like " geburtenkollaps -lrb- birth collapse -rrb- and " gebärstreik -lrb- birthing-strike . -rrb- " it 's prompted scientists such as jay winter at the american university of yale , to urge germans to " lower the ideological temperature of these debates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.12.2005 germany calls for tsunami early warning system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buouys like this one would be key to a european warning system one year after deadly tidal waves decimated parts of asia , germany is seeking to establish an early flood-warning system for europe 's coastline . " europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.12.2005 germany calls for tsunami early warning system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buouys like this one would be key to a european warning system one year after deadly tidal waves decimated parts of asia , germany is seeking to establish an early flood-warning system for europe 's coastline . " europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors .

" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible .

18 , german archaeologist susanne osthoff said her kidnappers were not criminals . speaking to doha-based satellite channel al-jazeera on monday , osthoff , 43 , said her captors told her not to be afraid as her kidnapping was " politically motivated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parliamentary ruprecht polenz wants osthoff to change her mind " do not be afraid .
we do not harm women or children and you are a muslim , " she quoted them as saying . " i was so happy to know that i had not fallen into the hands of criminals , " she said . little understanding yet osthoff 's proclaimed intention to return to iraq to continue her humanitarian and professional work has drawn the wrath of the german government . " it is regretful that ms. osthoff is not following the appeal of the german government not to return to irak , " said ruprecht polenz , president of the german parliamentary committee on foreign affairs . " she is precisely the one who should clearly see the risk of such a decision , " said polenz . german officials seem particularly irked by osthoff 's decision in view of the government effort that went into organizing her release .
only eight days after gaining her release , politicians are calling for levying a financial penalty as a consequence if osthoff should ignore their warnings and return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is also urging osthoff to stay away from iraq " after the intensive efforts of all parties involved over a period of three weeks in the end led to her being released , i would have little understanding if ms. osthoff found herself again in a dangerous situation , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier " i am appealing to ms. osthoff to distance herself from the plans of going back to iraq , " steinmeier said .
and spd parliamentarian lothar mark said osthoff should realize " the german tax payer would not finance another release effort should she once again be taken hostage . " osthoff herself has not responded to the german government 's criticism of her plans , but claudia roth , the head of the green party , has said she can understand that someone as dedicated as osthoff to helping the people of iraq would want to return . " in our democracy , it is good and right that people can make free decisions . ...
ms. osthoff should decide for herself what she wants to do , " roth said in the wednesday edition of the daily handelsblatt . noble intentions osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , said her captors demanded german humanitarian aid for iraq 's sunni arabs and stated clearly they did not want a ransom , but instead sought humanitarian aid for building schools and hospitals . she described her captors as " poor people " and said she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " she said she lived with her captors in a clean place and that they treated her " well . " but she repeated more than once that she " was sold , " without making clear what she meant .
she also expressed her shock at berlin 's failure to contact her captors . " i could not believe that the germans had not made any contact , " with her kidnapers she said , describing her feelings during captivity . 24 days in captivity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sign in osthoff 's hometown reads " susanne osthoff is free again !
thank you ! "
osthoff and her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani were seized on nov .
25 in iraq 's northwester nineveh province .
osthoff was freed on dec .
18 . she was the first german national to be kidnapped in iraq , and many questions remain unanswered about her ordeal .
according to german press reports in november , shortly after osthoff was siezed , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for her release . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen , although not on german soil . a picture has emerged of osthoff in the german press as a dedicated humanitarian and historian who was well aware of the risks of life in iraq but remained because of her close ties to people there . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany releases hezbollah hijacker wanted by us germany has quietly released a jailed hezbollah member wanted by the us for killing an american navy diver .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .
many commentators and sections of the media paint a bleak picture of german society in graphic terms words like " geburtenkollaps -lrb- birth collapse -rrb- and " gebärstreik -lrb- birthing-strike . -rrb- " it 's prompted scientists such as jay winter at the american university of yale , to urge germans to " lower the ideological temperature of these debates .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany debates the family fewer european couples tying the knot german women take the rap for declining birth rate opinion : mother 's day is n't what it used to be new parenting legislation focuses on fathers germany -pipe- 27.12.2005 germany 's population problems no longer taboo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a birth rate of just 1.4 percent the german government wants to combat the falling birth rate with better family policies .
tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .

" europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.12.2005 " iran must send different signals " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran has sparked international migivings about its nuclear ambitions the eu and iran want to reopen talks in january over teheran 's nuclear program .
dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .

" europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday .

throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .

a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated .

the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.12.2005 germany calls for tsunami early warning system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buouys like this one would be key to a european warning system one year after deadly tidal waves decimated parts of asia , germany is seeking to establish an early flood-warning system for europe 's coastline . " europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .
-lrb- dec .
26 , 2005 -rrb- german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .

blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .

" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .

helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible .

18 , german archaeologist susanne osthoff said her kidnappers were not criminals . speaking to doha-based satellite channel al-jazeera on monday , osthoff , 43 , said her captors told her not to be afraid as her kidnapping was " politically motivated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parliamentary ruprecht polenz wants osthoff to change her mind " do not be afraid .
we do not harm women or children and you are a muslim , " she quoted them as saying . " i was so happy to know that i had not fallen into the hands of criminals , " she said . little understanding yet osthoff 's proclaimed intention to return to iraq to continue her humanitarian and professional work has drawn the wrath of the german government . " it is regretful that ms. osthoff is not following the appeal of the german government not to return to irak , " said ruprecht polenz , president of the german parliamentary committee on foreign affairs . " she is precisely the one who should clearly see the risk of such a decision , " said polenz . german officials seem particularly irked by osthoff 's decision in view of the government effort that went into organizing her release .
only eight days after gaining her release , politicians are calling for levying a financial penalty as a consequence if osthoff should ignore their warnings and return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is also urging osthoff to stay away from iraq " after the intensive efforts of all parties involved over a period of three weeks in the end led to her being released , i would have little understanding if ms. osthoff found herself again in a dangerous situation , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier " i am appealing to ms. osthoff to distance herself from the plans of going back to iraq , " steinmeier said .
and spd parliamentarian lothar mark said osthoff should realize " the german tax payer would not finance another release effort should she once again be taken hostage .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .

" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .
-lrb- dec .
21 , 2005 -rrb- abducted german says no payment from us a german citizen of lebanese origin , mistakenly abducted and detained by the cia , said friday he had not received any payment from the united states or been asked to keep quiet about the affair .
-lrb- dec .
17 -rrb- schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror . "

" europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .

the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens .

blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.12.2005 working towards inter-religious emancipation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosque prayer rooms should be open to both sexes , women theologians say in most religions , the interpretation of beliefs is left up to the men .
but a group of women theologians from germany and other european nations want to change this . the inter-religious conference of european women theologians , or iketh , is a conglomeration of muslim , christian and jewish women who want to take religious interpretation into their own hands . most religions leave theological analysis up to the men , with few exceptions such as women ministers in the protestant church . " until now , dialogue among women in the church was kept at the level of exchanging recipes or pouring each other tea , " said rabeya müller , iketh 's founding member .
the german , who has converted to islam , said women only discussed daily rituals . " but we were rarely allowed to talk about the real fundamental theological topics , or there always had to be spiritual support from the men present , " müller said . not about excludi n g me n she added that women are still being overlooked in their religious communities .
in order to battle this discrimination , müller has gotten together with some 60 women ministers , researchers and religious academics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women want more say in all places of worship the new organization by no means wanted to be an elite circle . " it 's not about excluding men or making them worse , " müller said .
rather , iketh wanted to do justice to the koran . " when we say the koran is a book , which treats both genders equally , that god is a being just to both genders , then we ca n't in practice treat one gender unfairly , " she said . educatio n as a weapo n agai n st fu n dame n talist beliefs but the analysis of the koran is not iketh 's sole purpose .
the holy writings of other world religions also contain many parts which could be interpreted to the detriment of women - and are . " wherever we have to deal with hardliners , and they are present in all monotheistic religions , we want to oppose these fundamentalist flows with a progressive approach , a different theology , " said jewish theologian rachel herweg , one of the iketh directors . according to herweg , what will count in this case is who has the better arguments and who can win more supporters . " i am strongly betting on education and knowledge here , " herweg said . worship is n ' t just a matter for me n for herweg , no religion is fundamentally misogynistic .
but the fact that for centuries , theological ideas were laid out by men has played a role in the often discriminatory position of religious doctrines towards women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only progressive jewish communities allow women rabbis women have been largely excluded from the furthering of beliefs .
a striking example for women 's discrimination in religion is their exclusion from the priesthood , herweg said . " there is still the idea in the jewish orthodox tradition that public worship is a matter for men , " she said .
progressive and reformist-liberal jewish communities do allow women rabbis .
in christianity , only protestants allow women to be ordained . in islam , the koran does not explicitly forbid women from leading worshippers .
yet many male religious leaders argue that a woman leading prayers is only possible for all-female communities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslim men would not accept to be led in prayer by a woman müller and her colleagues are resisting the religious legitimization of this unequal treatment of women .
they are taking a new look at religious texts and interpreting them in a non-discriminatory manner towards women . in the future , iketh and its members want to make the results of their work public with publications and congresses .
they hope to strengthen women of all religions in their self-confidence . but the organization does not intend to portray their view as the only true interpretation , müller said .
rather , they want to stress women 's right to represent a different understanding of the holy writings . abdul-ahmad rashid -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on religion this collection of dw-world feature stories offers a closer look at religious issues .
being jewish in germany since 1989 , some 190,000 jews from the former soviet union have come to germany .
dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.12.2005 working towards inter-religious emancipation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosque prayer rooms should be open to both sexes , women theologians say in most religions , the interpretation of beliefs is left up to the men .
but a group of women theologians from germany and other european nations want to change this . the inter-religious conference of european women theologians , or iketh , is a conglomeration of muslim , christian and jewish women who want to take religious interpretation into their own hands . most religions leave theological analysis up to the men , with few exceptions such as women ministers in the protestant church . " until now , dialogue among women in the church was kept at the level of exchanging recipes or pouring each other tea , " said rabeya müller , iketh 's founding member .
the german , who has converted to islam , said women only discussed daily rituals . " but we were rarely allowed to talk about the real fundamental theological topics , or there always had to be spiritual support from the men present , " müller said . not about excludi n g me n she added that women are still being overlooked in their religious communities .
in order to battle this discrimination , müller has gotten together with some 60 women ministers , researchers and religious academics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women want more say in all places of worship the new organization by no means wanted to be an elite circle . " it 's not about excluding men or making them worse , " müller said .
rather , iketh wanted to do justice to the koran . " when we say the koran is a book , which treats both genders equally , that god is a being just to both genders , then we ca n't in practice treat one gender unfairly , " she said . educatio n as a weapo n agai n st fu n dame n talist beliefs but the analysis of the koran is not iketh 's sole purpose .
the holy writings of other world religions also contain many parts which could be interpreted to the detriment of women - and are . " wherever we have to deal with hardliners , and they are present in all monotheistic religions , we want to oppose these fundamentalist flows with a progressive approach , a different theology , " said jewish theologian rachel herweg , one of the iketh directors . according to herweg , what will count in this case is who has the better arguments and who can win more supporters . " i am strongly betting on education and knowledge here , " herweg said . worship is n ' t just a matter for me n for herweg , no religion is fundamentally misogynistic .
but the fact that for centuries , theological ideas were laid out by men has played a role in the often discriminatory position of religious doctrines towards women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only progressive jewish communities allow women rabbis women have been largely excluded from the furthering of beliefs .
a striking example for women 's discrimination in religion is their exclusion from the priesthood , herweg said . " there is still the idea in the jewish orthodox tradition that public worship is a matter for men , " she said .
progressive and reformist-liberal jewish communities do allow women rabbis .
in christianity , only protestants allow women to be ordained . in islam , the koran does not explicitly forbid women from leading worshippers .
yet many male religious leaders argue that a woman leading prayers is only possible for all-female communities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslim men would not accept to be led in prayer by a woman müller and her colleagues are resisting the religious legitimization of this unequal treatment of women .
they are taking a new look at religious texts and interpreting them in a non-discriminatory manner towards women . in the future , iketh and its members want to make the results of their work public with publications and congresses .
they hope to strengthen women of all religions in their self-confidence . but the organization does not intend to portray their view as the only true interpretation , müller said .
rather , they want to stress women 's right to represent a different understanding of the holy writings . abdul-ahmad rashid -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on religion this collection of dw-world feature stories offers a closer look at religious issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency europe -pipe- 27.12.2005 british eu presidency tenure fails to impress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair left the presidency without achieving many of the goals he set as britain 's six-month rotation as european union president draws to a close , observers look back on the past half year , which was marked by a series of attempts to reform the eu .
in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens . " ironically , britain 's critics accuse it of just that : failing to draw conclusions to recognized problems . terror laws , development aid , expansion success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the eu 's policy was dictated by the july terror attacks in london but blair did manage to cross some things off his list . after july 's bombing attacks in london , the british presidency got started by focusing on combating terrorism .
blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .
" but it does not have to . " constitution leads to european crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu practically stopped for the summer after the constitution was rejected wrangling with crisis after the french and dutch both rejected the european constitution in late summer , the british presidency wanted simply to ignore autumn 's traditional meeting of eu heads of state .
in the end though , blair invited his colleagues to hampton court outside of london to discuss europe 's social model , circumventing discussion of the eu constitution and causing european diplomats and parliamentarians to accuse london of twiddling its thumbs . rather than submitting a reformed draft of the 2007-2013 budget , britain shocked the european commission and member states alike with a barebones proposal to the detriment of the bloc 's poorer new member states . although normally blair 's friend , eu commission president jose barroso uttered a curt phrase in response : " it is simply not enough . " budget deal ends presidency on a high note worse still , to many european observers , the british proposal left intact its own cherished budget rebate , making the chances of reaching an agreement shrink with every passing minute . " they complain about a situation … they themselves brought about , " said martin schulz , head of the european parliament 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cool-headedness , and cash , is credited with negotiation of a budget agreement it was not until german chancellor angela merkel , at her first eu finance meeting , negotiated a compromise in a grueling late-night session that britain said it was prepared to give back part of the contentious rebate - but only after france agreed to allow evaluation of the eu agriculture policy it benefits from . while some called it a compromise of the lowest common denominator , tony blair insisted he was pleased with the deal . " it is clear to me that the budget we agreed to in the early hours of saturday is not the right budget for the future of europe , " he said .
" but for the meantime , until we achieve larger reforms , we will give the new member states control over their financial perspectives .

in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens . " ironically , britain 's critics accuse it of just that : failing to draw conclusions to recognized problems . terror laws , development aid , expansion success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the eu 's policy was dictated by the july terror attacks in london but blair did manage to cross some things off his list . after july 's bombing attacks in london , the british presidency got started by focusing on combating terrorism .
blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .
" but it does not have to . " constitution leads to european crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu practically stopped for the summer after the constitution was rejected wrangling with crisis after the french and dutch both rejected the european constitution in late summer , the british presidency wanted simply to ignore autumn 's traditional meeting of eu heads of state .
in the end though , blair invited his colleagues to hampton court outside of london to discuss europe 's social model , circumventing discussion of the eu constitution and causing european diplomats and parliamentarians to accuse london of twiddling its thumbs . rather than submitting a reformed draft of the 2007-2013 budget , britain shocked the european commission and member states alike with a barebones proposal to the detriment of the bloc 's poorer new member states . although normally blair 's friend , eu commission president jose barroso uttered a curt phrase in response : " it is simply not enough . " budget deal ends presidency on a high note worse still , to many european observers , the british proposal left intact its own cherished budget rebate , making the chances of reaching an agreement shrink with every passing minute . " they complain about a situation … they themselves brought about , " said martin schulz , head of the european parliament 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cool-headedness , and cash , is credited with negotiation of a budget agreement it was not until german chancellor angela merkel , at her first eu finance meeting , negotiated a compromise in a grueling late-night session that britain said it was prepared to give back part of the contentious rebate - but only after france agreed to allow evaluation of the eu agriculture policy it benefits from . while some called it a compromise of the lowest common denominator , tony blair insisted he was pleased with the deal . " it is clear to me that the budget we agreed to in the early hours of saturday is not the right budget for the future of europe , " he said .
" but for the meantime , until we achieve larger reforms , we will give the new member states control over their financial perspectives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.12.2005 working towards inter-religious emancipation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosque prayer rooms should be open to both sexes , women theologians say in most religions , the interpretation of beliefs is left up to the men .
but a group of women theologians from germany and other european nations want to change this . the inter-religious conference of european women theologians , or iketh , is a conglomeration of muslim , christian and jewish women who want to take religious interpretation into their own hands . most religions leave theological analysis up to the men , with few exceptions such as women ministers in the protestant church . " until now , dialogue among women in the church was kept at the level of exchanging recipes or pouring each other tea , " said rabeya müller , iketh 's founding member .
the german , who has converted to islam , said women only discussed daily rituals . " but we were rarely allowed to talk about the real fundamental theological topics , or there always had to be spiritual support from the men present , " müller said . not about excludi n g me n she added that women are still being overlooked in their religious communities .
in order to battle this discrimination , müller has gotten together with some 60 women ministers , researchers and religious academics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women want more say in all places of worship the new organization by no means wanted to be an elite circle . " it 's not about excluding men or making them worse , " müller said .
rather , iketh wanted to do justice to the koran . " when we say the koran is a book , which treats both genders equally , that god is a being just to both genders , then we ca n't in practice treat one gender unfairly , " she said . educatio n as a weapo n agai n st fu n dame n talist beliefs but the analysis of the koran is not iketh 's sole purpose .
the holy writings of other world religions also contain many parts which could be interpreted to the detriment of women - and are . " wherever we have to deal with hardliners , and they are present in all monotheistic religions , we want to oppose these fundamentalist flows with a progressive approach , a different theology , " said jewish theologian rachel herweg , one of the iketh directors . according to herweg , what will count in this case is who has the better arguments and who can win more supporters . " i am strongly betting on education and knowledge here , " herweg said . worship is n ' t just a matter for me n for herweg , no religion is fundamentally misogynistic .
but the fact that for centuries , theological ideas were laid out by men has played a role in the often discriminatory position of religious doctrines towards women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only progressive jewish communities allow women rabbis women have been largely excluded from the furthering of beliefs .
a striking example for women 's discrimination in religion is their exclusion from the priesthood , herweg said . " there is still the idea in the jewish orthodox tradition that public worship is a matter for men , " she said .
progressive and reformist-liberal jewish communities do allow women rabbis .
in christianity , only protestants allow women to be ordained . in islam , the koran does not explicitly forbid women from leading worshippers .
yet many male religious leaders argue that a woman leading prayers is only possible for all-female communities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslim men would not accept to be led in prayer by a woman müller and her colleagues are resisting the religious legitimization of this unequal treatment of women .
they are taking a new look at religious texts and interpreting them in a non-discriminatory manner towards women . in the future , iketh and its members want to make the results of their work public with publications and congresses .
they hope to strengthen women of all religions in their self-confidence . but the organization does not intend to portray their view as the only true interpretation , müller said .
rather , they want to stress women 's right to represent a different understanding of the holy writings . abdul-ahmad rashid -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on religion this collection of dw-world feature stories offers a closer look at religious issues .

intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .

" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .

the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .

18 , german archaeologist susanne osthoff said her kidnappers were not criminals . speaking to doha-based satellite channel al-jazeera on monday , osthoff , 43 , said her captors told her not to be afraid as her kidnapping was " politically motivated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parliamentary ruprecht polenz wants osthoff to change her mind " do not be afraid .
we do not harm women or children and you are a muslim , " she quoted them as saying . " i was so happy to know that i had not fallen into the hands of criminals , " she said . little understanding yet osthoff 's proclaimed intention to return to iraq to continue her humanitarian and professional work has drawn the wrath of the german government . " it is regretful that ms. osthoff is not following the appeal of the german government not to return to irak , " said ruprecht polenz , president of the german parliamentary committee on foreign affairs . " she is precisely the one who should clearly see the risk of such a decision , " said polenz . german officials seem particularly irked by osthoff 's decision in view of the government effort that went into organizing her release .
only eight days after gaining her release , politicians are calling for levying a financial penalty as a consequence if osthoff should ignore their warnings and return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is also urging osthoff to stay away from iraq " after the intensive efforts of all parties involved over a period of three weeks in the end led to her being released , i would have little understanding if ms. osthoff found herself again in a dangerous situation , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier " i am appealing to ms. osthoff to distance herself from the plans of going back to iraq , " steinmeier said .
and spd parliamentarian lothar mark said osthoff should realize " the german tax payer would not finance another release effort should she once again be taken hostage . " osthoff herself has not responded to the german government 's criticism of her plans , but claudia roth , the head of the green party , has said she can understand that someone as dedicated as osthoff to helping the people of iraq would want to return . " in our democracy , it is good and right that people can make free decisions . ...
ms. osthoff should decide for herself what she wants to do , " roth said in the wednesday edition of the daily handelsblatt . noble intentions osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , said her captors demanded german humanitarian aid for iraq 's sunni arabs and stated clearly they did not want a ransom , but instead sought humanitarian aid for building schools and hospitals . she described her captors as " poor people " and said she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " she said she lived with her captors in a clean place and that they treated her " well . " but she repeated more than once that she " was sold , " without making clear what she meant .
she also expressed her shock at berlin 's failure to contact her captors . " i could not believe that the germans had not made any contact , " with her kidnapers she said , describing her feelings during captivity . 24 days in captivity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sign in osthoff 's hometown reads " susanne osthoff is free again !
thank you ! "
osthoff and her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani were seized on nov .
25 in iraq 's northwester nineveh province .
osthoff was freed on dec .
18 . she was the first german national to be kidnapped in iraq , and many questions remain unanswered about her ordeal .
according to german press reports in november , shortly after osthoff was siezed , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for her release . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen , although not on german soil . a picture has emerged of osthoff in the german press as a dedicated humanitarian and historian who was well aware of the risks of life in iraq but remained because of her close ties to people there . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany releases hezbollah hijacker wanted by us germany has quietly released a jailed hezbollah member wanted by the us for killing an american navy diver .

18 , german archaeologist susanne osthoff said her kidnappers were not criminals . speaking to doha-based satellite channel al-jazeera on monday , osthoff , 43 , said her captors told her not to be afraid as her kidnapping was " politically motivated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parliamentary ruprecht polenz wants osthoff to change her mind " do not be afraid .
we do not harm women or children and you are a muslim , " she quoted them as saying . " i was so happy to know that i had not fallen into the hands of criminals , " she said . little understanding yet osthoff 's proclaimed intention to return to iraq to continue her humanitarian and professional work has drawn the wrath of the german government . " it is regretful that ms. osthoff is not following the appeal of the german government not to return to irak , " said ruprecht polenz , president of the german parliamentary committee on foreign affairs . " she is precisely the one who should clearly see the risk of such a decision , " said polenz . german officials seem particularly irked by osthoff 's decision in view of the government effort that went into organizing her release .
only eight days after gaining her release , politicians are calling for levying a financial penalty as a consequence if osthoff should ignore their warnings and return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is also urging osthoff to stay away from iraq " after the intensive efforts of all parties involved over a period of three weeks in the end led to her being released , i would have little understanding if ms. osthoff found herself again in a dangerous situation , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier " i am appealing to ms. osthoff to distance herself from the plans of going back to iraq , " steinmeier said .
and spd parliamentarian lothar mark said osthoff should realize " the german tax payer would not finance another release effort should she once again be taken hostage . " osthoff herself has not responded to the german government 's criticism of her plans , but claudia roth , the head of the green party , has said she can understand that someone as dedicated as osthoff to helping the people of iraq would want to return . " in our democracy , it is good and right that people can make free decisions . ...
ms. osthoff should decide for herself what she wants to do , " roth said in the wednesday edition of the daily handelsblatt . noble intentions osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , said her captors demanded german humanitarian aid for iraq 's sunni arabs and stated clearly they did not want a ransom , but instead sought humanitarian aid for building schools and hospitals . she described her captors as " poor people " and said she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " she said she lived with her captors in a clean place and that they treated her " well . " but she repeated more than once that she " was sold , " without making clear what she meant .
she also expressed her shock at berlin 's failure to contact her captors . " i could not believe that the germans had not made any contact , " with her kidnapers she said , describing her feelings during captivity . 24 days in captivity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sign in osthoff 's hometown reads " susanne osthoff is free again !
thank you ! "
osthoff and her iraqi driver shalid al-shimani were seized on nov .
25 in iraq 's northwester nineveh province .
osthoff was freed on dec .
18 . she was the first german national to be kidnapped in iraq , and many questions remain unanswered about her ordeal .
according to german press reports in november , shortly after osthoff was siezed , the kidnappers set an ultimatum of a few days for germany to change its policy towards baghdad as the price for her release . berlin has refused to send troops to iraq but has been helping to train iraqi policemen , although not on german soil . a picture has emerged of osthoff in the german press as a dedicated humanitarian and historian who was well aware of the risks of life in iraq but remained because of her close ties to people there . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany releases hezbollah hijacker wanted by us germany has quietly released a jailed hezbollah member wanted by the us for killing an american navy diver .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

" europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .

" europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .
many commentators and sections of the media paint a bleak picture of german society in graphic terms words like " geburtenkollaps -lrb- birth collapse -rrb- and " gebärstreik -lrb- birthing-strike . -rrb- " it 's prompted scientists such as jay winter at the american university of yale , to urge germans to " lower the ideological temperature of these debates .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency europe -pipe- 27.12.2005 british eu presidency tenure fails to impress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair left the presidency without achieving many of the goals he set as britain 's six-month rotation as european union president draws to a close , observers look back on the past half year , which was marked by a series of attempts to reform the eu .
in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens . " ironically , britain 's critics accuse it of just that : failing to draw conclusions to recognized problems . terror laws , development aid , expansion success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the eu 's policy was dictated by the july terror attacks in london but blair did manage to cross some things off his list . after july 's bombing attacks in london , the british presidency got started by focusing on combating terrorism .
blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .
" but it does not have to . " constitution leads to european crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu practically stopped for the summer after the constitution was rejected wrangling with crisis after the french and dutch both rejected the european constitution in late summer , the british presidency wanted simply to ignore autumn 's traditional meeting of eu heads of state .
in the end though , blair invited his colleagues to hampton court outside of london to discuss europe 's social model , circumventing discussion of the eu constitution and causing european diplomats and parliamentarians to accuse london of twiddling its thumbs . rather than submitting a reformed draft of the 2007-2013 budget , britain shocked the european commission and member states alike with a barebones proposal to the detriment of the bloc 's poorer new member states . although normally blair 's friend , eu commission president jose barroso uttered a curt phrase in response : " it is simply not enough . " budget deal ends presidency on a high note worse still , to many european observers , the british proposal left intact its own cherished budget rebate , making the chances of reaching an agreement shrink with every passing minute . " they complain about a situation … they themselves brought about , " said martin schulz , head of the european parliament 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cool-headedness , and cash , is credited with negotiation of a budget agreement it was not until german chancellor angela merkel , at her first eu finance meeting , negotiated a compromise in a grueling late-night session that britain said it was prepared to give back part of the contentious rebate - but only after france agreed to allow evaluation of the eu agriculture policy it benefits from . while some called it a compromise of the lowest common denominator , tony blair insisted he was pleased with the deal .

in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens . " ironically , britain 's critics accuse it of just that : failing to draw conclusions to recognized problems . terror laws , development aid , expansion success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the eu 's policy was dictated by the july terror attacks in london but blair did manage to cross some things off his list . after july 's bombing attacks in london , the british presidency got started by focusing on combating terrorism .
blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .
" but it does not have to . " constitution leads to european crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu practically stopped for the summer after the constitution was rejected wrangling with crisis after the french and dutch both rejected the european constitution in late summer , the british presidency wanted simply to ignore autumn 's traditional meeting of eu heads of state .
in the end though , blair invited his colleagues to hampton court outside of london to discuss europe 's social model , circumventing discussion of the eu constitution and causing european diplomats and parliamentarians to accuse london of twiddling its thumbs . rather than submitting a reformed draft of the 2007-2013 budget , britain shocked the european commission and member states alike with a barebones proposal to the detriment of the bloc 's poorer new member states . although normally blair 's friend , eu commission president jose barroso uttered a curt phrase in response : " it is simply not enough . " budget deal ends presidency on a high note worse still , to many european observers , the british proposal left intact its own cherished budget rebate , making the chances of reaching an agreement shrink with every passing minute . " they complain about a situation … they themselves brought about , " said martin schulz , head of the european parliament 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cool-headedness , and cash , is credited with negotiation of a budget agreement it was not until german chancellor angela merkel , at her first eu finance meeting , negotiated a compromise in a grueling late-night session that britain said it was prepared to give back part of the contentious rebate - but only after france agreed to allow evaluation of the eu agriculture policy it benefits from . while some called it a compromise of the lowest common denominator , tony blair insisted he was pleased with the deal .

in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens . " ironically , britain 's critics accuse it of just that : failing to draw conclusions to recognized problems . terror laws , development aid , expansion success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the eu 's policy was dictated by the july terror attacks in london but blair did manage to cross some things off his list . after july 's bombing attacks in london , the british presidency got started by focusing on combating terrorism .
blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .
" but it does not have to . " constitution leads to european crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu practically stopped for the summer after the constitution was rejected wrangling with crisis after the french and dutch both rejected the european constitution in late summer , the british presidency wanted simply to ignore autumn 's traditional meeting of eu heads of state .
in the end though , blair invited his colleagues to hampton court outside of london to discuss europe 's social model , circumventing discussion of the eu constitution and causing european diplomats and parliamentarians to accuse london of twiddling its thumbs . rather than submitting a reformed draft of the 2007-2013 budget , britain shocked the european commission and member states alike with a barebones proposal to the detriment of the bloc 's poorer new member states . although normally blair 's friend , eu commission president jose barroso uttered a curt phrase in response : " it is simply not enough . " budget deal ends presidency on a high note worse still , to many european observers , the british proposal left intact its own cherished budget rebate , making the chances of reaching an agreement shrink with every passing minute . " they complain about a situation … they themselves brought about , " said martin schulz , head of the european parliament 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cool-headedness , and cash , is credited with negotiation of a budget agreement it was not until german chancellor angela merkel , at her first eu finance meeting , negotiated a compromise in a grueling late-night session that britain said it was prepared to give back part of the contentious rebate - but only after france agreed to allow evaluation of the eu agriculture policy it benefits from . while some called it a compromise of the lowest common denominator , tony blair insisted he was pleased with the deal . " it is clear to me that the budget we agreed to in the early hours of saturday is not the right budget for the future of europe , " he said .
" but for the meantime , until we achieve larger reforms , we will give the new member states control over their financial perspectives .

18 , german archaeologist susanne osthoff said her kidnappers were not criminals . speaking to doha-based satellite channel al-jazeera on monday , osthoff , 43 , said her captors told her not to be afraid as her kidnapping was " politically motivated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parliamentary ruprecht polenz wants osthoff to change her mind " do not be afraid .
we do not harm women or children and you are a muslim , " she quoted them as saying . " i was so happy to know that i had not fallen into the hands of criminals , " she said . little understanding yet osthoff 's proclaimed intention to return to iraq to continue her humanitarian and professional work has drawn the wrath of the german government . " it is regretful that ms. osthoff is not following the appeal of the german government not to return to irak , " said ruprecht polenz , president of the german parliamentary committee on foreign affairs . " she is precisely the one who should clearly see the risk of such a decision , " said polenz . german officials seem particularly irked by osthoff 's decision in view of the government effort that went into organizing her release .
only eight days after gaining her release , politicians are calling for levying a financial penalty as a consequence if osthoff should ignore their warnings and return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier is also urging osthoff to stay away from iraq " after the intensive efforts of all parties involved over a period of three weeks in the end led to her being released , i would have little understanding if ms. osthoff found herself again in a dangerous situation , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier " i am appealing to ms. osthoff to distance herself from the plans of going back to iraq , " steinmeier said .

" in our democracy , it is good and right that people can make free decisions . ...
ms. osthoff should decide for herself what she wants to do , " roth said in the wednesday edition of the daily handelsblatt . noble intentions osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , said her captors demanded german humanitarian aid for iraq 's sunni arabs and stated clearly they did not want a ransom , but instead sought humanitarian aid for building schools and hospitals . she described her captors as " poor people " and said she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " she said she lived with her captors in a clean place and that they treated her " well . " but she repeated more than once that she " was sold , " without making clear what she meant .
she also expressed her shock at berlin 's failure to contact her captors . " i could not believe that the germans had not made any contact , " with her kidnapers she said , describing her feelings during captivity . 24 days in captivity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sign in osthoff 's hometown reads " susanne osthoff is free again !

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .

21 , 2005 -rrb- abducted german says no payment from us a german citizen of lebanese origin , mistakenly abducted and detained by the cia , said friday he had not received any payment from the united states or been asked to keep quiet about the affair .
-lrb- dec .
17 -rrb- schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror . "

debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .

neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .

" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "

in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens . " ironically , britain 's critics accuse it of just that : failing to draw conclusions to recognized problems . terror laws , development aid , expansion success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the eu 's policy was dictated by the july terror attacks in london but blair did manage to cross some things off his list . after july 's bombing attacks in london , the british presidency got started by focusing on combating terrorism .
blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .
" but it does not have to . " constitution leads to european crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu practically stopped for the summer after the constitution was rejected wrangling with crisis after the french and dutch both rejected the european constitution in late summer , the british presidency wanted simply to ignore autumn 's traditional meeting of eu heads of state .
in the end though , blair invited his colleagues to hampton court outside of london to discuss europe 's social model , circumventing discussion of the eu constitution and causing european diplomats and parliamentarians to accuse london of twiddling its thumbs . rather than submitting a reformed draft of the 2007-2013 budget , britain shocked the european commission and member states alike with a barebones proposal to the detriment of the bloc 's poorer new member states . although normally blair 's friend , eu commission president jose barroso uttered a curt phrase in response : " it is simply not enough . " budget deal ends presidency on a high note worse still , to many european observers , the british proposal left intact its own cherished budget rebate , making the chances of reaching an agreement shrink with every passing minute . " they complain about a situation … they themselves brought about , " said martin schulz , head of the european parliament 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cool-headedness , and cash , is credited with negotiation of a budget agreement it was not until german chancellor angela merkel , at her first eu finance meeting , negotiated a compromise in a grueling late-night session that britain said it was prepared to give back part of the contentious rebate - but only after france agreed to allow evaluation of the eu agriculture policy it benefits from . while some called it a compromise of the lowest common denominator , tony blair insisted he was pleased with the deal . " it is clear to me that the budget we agreed to in the early hours of saturday is not the right budget for the future of europe , " he said .
" but for the meantime , until we achieve larger reforms , we will give the new member states control over their financial perspectives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.12.2005 germany calls for tsunami early warning system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buouys like this one would be key to a european warning system one year after deadly tidal waves decimated parts of asia , germany is seeking to establish an early flood-warning system for europe 's coastline . " europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .

26 , 2005 -rrb- german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

but a group of women theologians from germany and other european nations want to change this . the inter-religious conference of european women theologians , or iketh , is a conglomeration of muslim , christian and jewish women who want to take religious interpretation into their own hands . most religions leave theological analysis up to the men , with few exceptions such as women ministers in the protestant church . " until now , dialogue among women in the church was kept at the level of exchanging recipes or pouring each other tea , " said rabeya müller , iketh 's founding member .
the german , who has converted to islam , said women only discussed daily rituals . " but we were rarely allowed to talk about the real fundamental theological topics , or there always had to be spiritual support from the men present , " müller said . not about excludi n g me n she added that women are still being overlooked in their religious communities .
in order to battle this discrimination , müller has gotten together with some 60 women ministers , researchers and religious academics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women want more say in all places of worship the new organization by no means wanted to be an elite circle . " it 's not about excluding men or making them worse , " müller said .
rather , iketh wanted to do justice to the koran . " when we say the koran is a book , which treats both genders equally , that god is a being just to both genders , then we ca n't in practice treat one gender unfairly , " she said . educatio n as a weapo n agai n st fu n dame n talist beliefs but the analysis of the koran is not iketh 's sole purpose .
the holy writings of other world religions also contain many parts which could be interpreted to the detriment of women - and are . " wherever we have to deal with hardliners , and they are present in all monotheistic religions , we want to oppose these fundamentalist flows with a progressive approach , a different theology , " said jewish theologian rachel herweg , one of the iketh directors . according to herweg , what will count in this case is who has the better arguments and who can win more supporters . " i am strongly betting on education and knowledge here , " herweg said . worship is n ' t just a matter for me n for herweg , no religion is fundamentally misogynistic .
but the fact that for centuries , theological ideas were laid out by men has played a role in the often discriminatory position of religious doctrines towards women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only progressive jewish communities allow women rabbis women have been largely excluded from the furthering of beliefs .
a striking example for women 's discrimination in religion is their exclusion from the priesthood , herweg said . " there is still the idea in the jewish orthodox tradition that public worship is a matter for men , " she said .
progressive and reformist-liberal jewish communities do allow women rabbis .
in christianity , only protestants allow women to be ordained . in islam , the koran does not explicitly forbid women from leading worshippers .
yet many male religious leaders argue that a woman leading prayers is only possible for all-female communities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslim men would not accept to be led in prayer by a woman müller and her colleagues are resisting the religious legitimization of this unequal treatment of women .
they are taking a new look at religious texts and interpreting them in a non-discriminatory manner towards women . in the future , iketh and its members want to make the results of their work public with publications and congresses .
they hope to strengthen women of all religions in their self-confidence . but the organization does not intend to portray their view as the only true interpretation , müller said .
rather , they want to stress women 's right to represent a different understanding of the holy writings . abdul-ahmad rashid -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on religion this collection of dw-world feature stories offers a closer look at religious issues .

" europe must be better prepared for natural catastrophes , " minister for education and research annette schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . " we can not exclude the possibility of tidal waves here .
it is a question of geology , but also of climate change , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research minister annette schavan supports the european warning system according to researchers , a tidal wave in europe as the result of an underwater earthquake or other seismic activity is becoming increasingly plausible .
throughout history , europe has been hit by several tsunamis , both in the mediterranean and on the atlantic coast . historic evidence the biggest such catastrophe was the 1755 earthquake in lisbon , which triggered waves of up to 15-meters in height and wrecked a path of destruction from england to north africa . some 60,000 people died in the gushing waters .
today the region is more densely populated ; and an earthquake of similar magnitude would result in considerably more damage and lost lives . the eastern mediterranean , where the eurasian and african tectonic plates meet , is especially prone to earthquakes , including underwater ones .
between 1801 and 1956 , greek geologists counted 40 tsunamis in the mediterranean and aegean .
because these are closed bodies of waters , the waves were relatively small and the extent of damage minimal .
a high-magnitude earthquake , however , such as the one which hit istanbul in 1999 , is not entirely unlikely if it struck would result in severe damage and loss of lives . europe needs early warning system given the historic evidence and the geologic make-up of the continent , seismologists have argued that europe too needs to establish a tsunami early warning system for its coastline , especially considering that so much of the high-risk areas are densely populated . " i will campaign for the eu to make funds available , " schavan told the newspaper .
the project is expected to be discussed at an international conference on early warning systems that will take place in march , in bonn . ten minutes ' warning following asia 's flooding catastrophe a year ago , germany helped put in place an early warning system for tsunamis off the coast of sumatra .
schavan told the paper the first results from the measuring system were being recorded and evaluated . starting in 2008 , the system in the indian ocean is expected to work in real time .
that would give people on land around ten minutes ' warning time . the german government has spent 45 million euros -lrb- 53 million -rrb- on the system . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary amid tears , prayers tearful mourners from around the world gathered monday to light candles and offer prayers on the anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami , one of the deadliest natural disasters ever .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .
many commentators and sections of the media paint a bleak picture of german society in graphic terms words like " geburtenkollaps -lrb- birth collapse -rrb- and " gebärstreik -lrb- birthing-strike . -rrb- " it 's prompted scientists such as jay winter at the american university of yale , to urge germans to " lower the ideological temperature of these debates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.12.2005 " iran must send different signals " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran has sparked international migivings about its nuclear ambitions the eu and iran want to reopen talks in january over teheran 's nuclear program .
dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

dw-world spoke to german arms expert oliver meier about the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff . oliver meier works at the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg and is an international representative and correspondent of the arms control association in berlin . mr. meier , how would you judge iran 's nuclear program ? the iranian nuclear program has sparked considerable suspicion internationally .
for one , because of the scale of its activities .
if the nuclear program is implemented the way iran plans , then it could quickly be misused militarily .
that means iran could then very swiftly move from civilian use to the building of a nuclear bomb .
a further reason for mistrust is that iran has for years concealed important activities from the international nuclear energy watchdog and only after much prodding has it revealed its program .
several important questions are still open . do you suspect that iran also has hidden intentions of producing nuclear weapons ? that 's difficult to gauge .
there are indications , but no proof .
iran still refuses to answer some important questions , which does give rise to the suspicion that it 's not just civilian aims that are being pursued here .
it 's also possible that even in iran there are differing views on the question - that maybe they want to create the possibility of making nuclear weapons , but still have n't made a concrete decision on whether they should chase such a goal . could iran secretly be pursuing a uranium enrichment program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian experts inspect the nuclear plant in the city of isfahan there 's no proof for that .
and the uranium enrichment plants that iran has revealed are currently subject to international controls and have been shut down .
in light of that , we have to assume that such activities do n't exist .
there are always new accusations , particularly from the us , that uranium-enrichment activities are secretly taking place in iran .
the question thus is how iran can regain international trust in the fact that it actually is only interested in tapping energy with its program .
the europeans say : the right solution is for iran to completely renounce uranium enrichment .
the europeans are also prepared to find ways for reliably suppling iran with enriched uranium to power civilian nuclear facilities . iran has decided to restart uranium conversion .
what does that mean ? iran has started uranium conversion .
that 's a precursor to enrichment .
the product that 's created ca n't be used militarily .
but here iran , some say in a piecemeal way , has taken a further step towards enrichment .
were iran to restart enrichment , then the talks with the europeans would break off .
that would urgently raise the question of referring iran to the security council . how would things go on from there ? the us and europe seem to be in agreement that sanctions should n't be immediately imposed .
the un security council would definitely try to press iran to better cooperate , guarantee access to international inspectors and clear open questions .
the security council would once again support this attempt by the international community and - this revives memories of iraq - try to create further possibilities for inspections . how do you rate the chances of a diplomatic solution to this escalating nuclear threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad raised a global outcry with his comments on israel there are certainly always chances for a solution .
but , the question is whether iran is really interested in such a solution .
i think the europeans are hugely interested and parts of the us too .
iran definitely has to move on the issue .
it will have to reverse some of the tough positions that have been formulated since the election of the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad for instance , the announcement in early december that iran would in any case enrich uranium on its own soil .
if that really is the case , then the basic fundament of talks with the europeans has been violated .
here , iran has to send different signals . on the other hand , the europeans too could cede some ground and , for instance , offer more help in civilian areas .
and another important question is how the us would react to a diplomatic solution .
there 's still a lot of ambivalence regarding that .
the us must take a clearer stance on the side of the europeans . how grave a danger could iran pose ? for one , it 's a combination of iran possibly equipping itself with nuclear weapons and views that israel must be wiped off the map .
the israelis have made it clear that they would n't sit back and accept such a development .
thus , there 's not just a threat of an arms race but also a military conflict .
but , there are further scenarios too .
other countries in the region , for example , saudi arabia could follow the nuclear weapons lead .
that would trigger further arms races .
the danger of a military confrontation is rapidly rising and teheran has to carefully consider if it wants to take a risk or be prepared instead to give up certain things in return for other concessions .
for iran , the issue is also about economic cooperation with the west as a whole .
iran could face very high costs if it continues down its current path . interview conducted by sonja lindenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects russian nuclear offer iran on sunday rejected an offer from russia for the islamic republic to conduct uranium enrichment activities on its soil , foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible . " though this new openness and neutrality regarding population policies is a positive development in germany , there is a flip-side to it . like with most other political topics , there is a tendency to emotionally heat up the topic .

in the end , little was achieved . shortly after british prime minister tony blair blocked the first eu budget proposal this summer , he jumped into the eu presidency 's driver 's seat and promised a series of deep-seated changes to the union . in an impassioned speech in front of the european parliament , blair promised to get started right away with fundamental eu reforms and a debate about where the union should head . " the most important thing is to show the people where we are headed , " he said .
" what frustrates me a little is that we create commissions that give us answers , but then nothing happens . " ironically , britain 's critics accuse it of just that : failing to draw conclusions to recognized problems . terror laws , development aid , expansion success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the eu 's policy was dictated by the july terror attacks in london but blair did manage to cross some things off his list . after july 's bombing attacks in london , the british presidency got started by focusing on combating terrorism .
blair headed up initiatives to improve international coordination in the fight against terror with laws to save telephone and internet logs to help in investigations . then the british presidency succeeded in convincing the eu to double its developmental aid to africa to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015 .
blair also got to chalk up the planned opening of expansion talks with turkey and croatia as a success of his time at the head of eu . " we had a success , not a disaster , because we opened negotiations with turkey , " he said of the talks scheduled for oct .
4 .
" that was the goal we set ourselves . " it was a goal blair achieved after a slow and winding process that concluded with a harried 24-hour marathon meeting to break down opposition from cyprus and austria .
despite voting for the beginning of negotiations , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik insisted that opening talks was no guarantee for actual accession , leaving the question of whether historians will accuse blair of celebrating too early unanswered . " at the end of a very long negotiations process it could come to accession , " said plassnik , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january .
" but it does not have to . " constitution leads to european crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu practically stopped for the summer after the constitution was rejected wrangling with crisis after the french and dutch both rejected the european constitution in late summer , the british presidency wanted simply to ignore autumn 's traditional meeting of eu heads of state .
in the end though , blair invited his colleagues to hampton court outside of london to discuss europe 's social model , circumventing discussion of the eu constitution and causing european diplomats and parliamentarians to accuse london of twiddling its thumbs . rather than submitting a reformed draft of the 2007-2013 budget , britain shocked the european commission and member states alike with a barebones proposal to the detriment of the bloc 's poorer new member states . although normally blair 's friend , eu commission president jose barroso uttered a curt phrase in response : " it is simply not enough . " budget deal ends presidency on a high note worse still , to many european observers , the british proposal left intact its own cherished budget rebate , making the chances of reaching an agreement shrink with every passing minute . " they complain about a situation … they themselves brought about , " said martin schulz , head of the european parliament 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cool-headedness , and cash , is credited with negotiation of a budget agreement it was not until german chancellor angela merkel , at her first eu finance meeting , negotiated a compromise in a grueling late-night session that britain said it was prepared to give back part of the contentious rebate - but only after france agreed to allow evaluation of the eu agriculture policy it benefits from . while some called it a compromise of the lowest common denominator , tony blair insisted he was pleased with the deal . " it is clear to me that the budget we agreed to in the early hours of saturday is not the right budget for the future of europe , " he said .
" but for the meantime , until we achieve larger reforms , we will give the new member states control over their financial perspectives . " bernd riegert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 2005 : the year the eu would rather forget after the soaring high of its " big bang " enlargement in 2004 , the european union plunged to a historic low in 2005 amid a crisis over its constitution and a protracted row over the budget .

the german , who has converted to islam , said women only discussed daily rituals . " but we were rarely allowed to talk about the real fundamental theological topics , or there always had to be spiritual support from the men present , " müller said . not about excludi n g me n she added that women are still being overlooked in their religious communities .
in order to battle this discrimination , müller has gotten together with some 60 women ministers , researchers and religious academics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women want more say in all places of worship the new organization by no means wanted to be an elite circle . " it 's not about excluding men or making them worse , " müller said .
rather , iketh wanted to do justice to the koran . " when we say the koran is a book , which treats both genders equally , that god is a being just to both genders , then we ca n't in practice treat one gender unfairly , " she said . educatio n as a weapo n agai n st fu n dame n talist beliefs but the analysis of the koran is not iketh 's sole purpose .
the holy writings of other world religions also contain many parts which could be interpreted to the detriment of women - and are . " wherever we have to deal with hardliners , and they are present in all monotheistic religions , we want to oppose these fundamentalist flows with a progressive approach , a different theology , " said jewish theologian rachel herweg , one of the iketh directors . according to herweg , what will count in this case is who has the better arguments and who can win more supporters . " i am strongly betting on education and knowledge here , " herweg said . worship is n ' t just a matter for me n for herweg , no religion is fundamentally misogynistic .
but the fact that for centuries , theological ideas were laid out by men has played a role in the often discriminatory position of religious doctrines towards women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only progressive jewish communities allow women rabbis women have been largely excluded from the furthering of beliefs .
a striking example for women 's discrimination in religion is their exclusion from the priesthood , herweg said . " there is still the idea in the jewish orthodox tradition that public worship is a matter for men , " she said .
progressive and reformist-liberal jewish communities do allow women rabbis .
in christianity , only protestants allow women to be ordained . in islam , the koran does not explicitly forbid women from leading worshippers .
yet many male religious leaders argue that a woman leading prayers is only possible for all-female communities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslim men would not accept to be led in prayer by a woman müller and her colleagues are resisting the religious legitimization of this unequal treatment of women .
they are taking a new look at religious texts and interpreting them in a non-discriminatory manner towards women . in the future , iketh and its members want to make the results of their work public with publications and congresses .
they hope to strengthen women of all religions in their self-confidence . but the organization does not intend to portray their view as the only true interpretation , müller said .
rather , they want to stress women 's right to represent a different understanding of the holy writings . abdul-ahmad rashid -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on religion this collection of dw-world feature stories offers a closer look at religious issues .

tainted by controversial associations during the nazi era , the issue was all but taboo until a few years ago . grappling with a shrinking and graying population , germany sometimes looks with envy towards its neighbor , france .
since the end of the 1990s , france has been enjoying a baby boom . the french newspaper le figaro recently proudly proclaimed : " we are 62 million french . "
indeed , the french population is growing while the german one is declining .
today , france has the highest birth rate in europe with more births every year than germany . as opposed to that germany , which is home to 82 million people , has a birth rate of 1.4 percent , making it one of the most rapidly shrinking populations in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france took further measures this year to encourage women to have three children there are several reasons for the differences in the demographic structures of europe 's two largest countries , the policies practiced by both governments being just some of them . troubled past but what remains indisputable is that pursuing an active population policy in germany was frowned upon after world war ii and the end of the nazi regime . the opposite was true in france : president charles de gaulle demanded 12 million babies from his countrymen- and women - something that the french did n't in the least bit find offensive . but the same was unthinkable in germany at the end of the nazi era , said reiner klingholz of the berlin institute for world population and global development . " when it came to demography , the german debate oriented itself very much on the past .
and our nazi past had loaded the topic with terms like race research , race ideology and that 's why there was a great reluctance to even deal with the issue after world war ii , " klingholz said . misuse of the issue by the nazis this hesitancy to tackle demographic issues is evident in all formerly fascist-ruled countries in europe because family policies were a means to an end there : the own nation was meant to be highly bred in order to dominate others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis offered perks to german mothers to have children in a radio address broadcast on mother 's day in 1935 , hitler 's interior minister wilhelm frick , left no doubt about the murderous racial delusion propagated by the nazis . " you all know very well how worrying the falling birth rate of the german people since the turn of the century has been : how the sad fact of wrong selection and the mixing of races began to have an impact because the honest families in all social classes had fewer children while those less worthwhile and the bastardly uninhibitedly multiplied or irresponsible german people coupled with alien races , " frick said . the nazis used demographics as a tool for their own purpose : german mothers with more than three children were honored with a special " mother 's cross " starting 1938 .
adolf hitler described motherhood as a " battlefield of the woman " because german women were meant to give birth to german soldiers . with a combination of economic perks and ideological elevation of the role of the mother , the nazis tried to inspire german women to have as many children as possible . postwar germany wary of population policy it was this delusion of the nazis for a racially pure population that later made family policy a taboo topic , said klingholz . " german politicians of the postwar era actually consciously kept their distance from the issue , " said klingholz . " konrad adenauer once said ' people are going to get kids anyway . '
helmut schmidt said that politics had nothing to seek in people 's beds , even helmut kohl and the schröder government in the beginning did n't want to get involved in family issues , " said klingholz , adding that the issue , for many , still reeked too strongly of nazi associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen , family minister in merkel 's cabinet is a mother of seven herself it 's only recently that germans have begun to debate the issue of a falling birth rate and raise questions about whether the greater desire of the french to have children has anything to do with better child care opportunities in the neighboring country . debate free of ideology according to reiner klingholz , the current debate in germany has its roots in tangible material reasons . " the debate only kicked off properly in germany about two years ago , and interestingly had to do with the crisis of the social systems , " klingholz said .
at the same time he pointed out that the present crisis of german social systems still has nothing to do with demographic factors . " that is still to come , and only in the year 2015 when the last baby-boomer generations retire " will the results be felt , he said . according to klingholz , there is a huge advantage in the current debate , particularly in the past weeks and months .
" today family policies are discussed almost entirely free of ideology : the importance of all-day child care in kindergartens or in schools is suddenly acknowledged by everyone , and suddenly it 's possible .

what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ? german politicians agree on one thing : the terror attacks on the world trade center in 2001 changed the world .
" since september 11 , 2001 , we know we are facing terrorists who are trying to have their way with our constitutional democracies , " dirk niebel , general secretary of the free democrat party , or fdp , said recently .
facing ' asymetrical threat ' " it is an asymetrical threat that has had the effect of shifting the border between internal and external security ; the border between intelligence and law enforcement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese german khaled el masri was abducted by the cia as a terror suspect the terrorists ' tactics mean constitutional democracies need to change their defense strategies in order to protect their citizens .
intelligence agencies have automatically taken up front-line positions in this fight .
but what should they be allowed to do to protect their citizens - and what should n't they ?
how far can they go to collect information ?
the debate over these issues has just begun .
debate on eavesdropping in us in the us last week , controversy broke out after word got out that us president george w. bush had authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on telephone and internet conversations inside the us , without first getting court approval .
a debate is raging as to whether bush had the legal authority to order the spying or if it amounts to an unlawful circumvention of federal laws established to protect the privacy rights of americans .
the prominent media attention to that affair , the recent uproar over the cia 's abduction of lebanese-born german national khaled el masri , and reports that german intelligence agents interrogated prisoners in guantanamo and in syrian torture prisons led foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- who was responsible for secret intelligence in the previous administration -rrb- to take a stand before the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was head of secret services in the last administration " the german government has always made it clear that cooperation does and must take place on the basis of valid law .
that is especially true for the masri case , " steinmeier told the bundestag . but wolfgang wieland , security expert fort he green party , says that when a state " reaps the fruits of torture , " it is " overstepping the red line . "
neither the torture issue nor incarceration of terror suspects is addressed in the coalition agreement between germany 's governing left-right coalition partners , the social democrats and the christian democrats .
but the partners did agree to expand the so-called " prevention authorities " of the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , in order to make it easier to track criminals in the federal states .
world cup danger ?
but the cdu / csu wants more .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble would like to be allowed to deploy the army within germany , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be on high alert for terrorism during the soccer world cup this summer " especially during the world cup soccer matches it would be easy to imagine such -lrb- terror -rrb- situtations that would bring us to a point where the police force wo n't be enough , " he said .
" if that 's the case , we could use our army as a temporary solution , if it is necessary for defense . " schäuble 's approach gets a divisive reaction from coalition partners .
spd parliamentary group head peter struck calls it " irritating ; " spd defense expert rainer arnold said " schauble is harming the german army . "
and even defense minister franz joseph jung , himself a cdu member , said " the german army is not an auxiliary police force . "
whatever measures are to be taken on terrorism and intelligence gathering , it is doubtful changes will be made any time soon .
union und spd leaders have agreed to approach the topic after the german constitutional court decides on airline security laws regulating shooting down hijacked airplanes . stefan dege -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report .

"
the ship of the iraqi state has a course set for constitutional government , leading , it is hoped , to stable and democratic rule in a unified country .
a successful election , but no functional government yet whether it will reach that destination is still unclear , though what is certain is that the waters are rough .
the biggest plus as one looks ahead is that elections for the new assembly - the council of representatives as it is to be called - produced a 70 % turnout with no boycott by the sunnis .
the american view is that elections are like a magic wand and produce their own beneficial effect .
this may be so but elections have to produce viable governments .
an election in el salvador in 1982 went off well in terms of numbers but the civil war there went on for another decade .
if it took 10 years to pacify iraq , it might not be so bad in terms of time historically , but in terms of casualties it would be tragic .
long road to government the turnout in iraq therefore will now have to be converted into a functional government and the timetable could stretch out for some time - up to three months or so if there is serious disagreement - because so many procedures have to be gone through first .
some sunni and secular parties allege the election was tainted the results have to be formally declared , the parties have to negotiate for a coalition , a presidential council has to be selected and then a prime minister and a government .
the results so far indicate that iraqis voted according to sectional and religious interests .
the us ambassador in baghdad , zalmay khalilzad , said : " it looks as if people have preferred to vote for their ethnic or sectarian identities , but for iraq to succeed there has to be cross-ethnic and cross-sectarian co-operation . "
so the shias dominate , the kurds are a strong minority , the secular are suffering but the sunnis are protesting .
indeed the main sunni grouping , the iraq accord front , claiming fraud , is threatening to boycott the assembly if there is no re-run vote in some areas .
since there will be no re-run , it remains to be seen if this threat will be put into practice .
" we 're going to have to face the fact that there are strong centrifugal forces in iraq that have the potential of tearing the country apart , " james dobbins , a former us diplomat in the balkans and now with the rand corporation , said in the los angeles times .
and even if the sunnis do join the assembly , it may be that they are simply opening up a new front to urge the removal of us and other foreign forces .
it does not mean that the insurgency will end .
the election may be over but the war is not .
security what also has to happen , in the view of british and us officials , is that the shias have to bend a bit and offer the sunnis more in talks about amending the constitution .
a move on the distribution of oil wealth to share out future discoveries more evenly would help .
on the security front , much remains to be done .
the plan is that the iraqis should take over progressively but the implementation has been weak because of the poor state of the iraqi police .
us troop levels are higher than they were two years ago if this process can be improved , then some troops are likely to go but this should not be mistaken for a withdrawal .
even if a few thousand us soldiers left now , the troop levels would still be higher than they were two years ago .
2005 has been a difficult year in iraq but the place has still amazingly held together despite the worst efforts of abu musab al-zarqawi and his al-qaeda cohorts .
it is instructive to note the language they use in the statements they issue on the internet and how it could not be less amenable to dialogue .
the shias are termed " the grandchildren of the al-alqami " , which is a derogatory term for shias and a reference to ibn al-alqami , a shia minister who was accused of betraying the caliph during the mongol huluqu 's attack on baghdad in 1258 .
iraqi political leaders are " polytheists " who took part in the " prostitution wedding of heresy and immorality " or elections .
the iraqi security forces are " pagan " and the foreign troops of course are the " crusaders " .
we will hear more such terminology in the coming year .
the question is whether these forces can be so isolated that they cease to have a significant effect .
much of the insurgency is carried on by sunnis not motivated by such extreme ideals and who are more concerned with foreign occupation and the protection of their own communities and interests .
if the new government can give these people hope , then iraq will have some hope .

"
the ship of the iraqi state has a course set for constitutional government , leading , it is hoped , to stable and democratic rule in a unified country .
a successful election , but no functional government yet whether it will reach that destination is still unclear , though what is certain is that the waters are rough .
the biggest plus as one looks ahead is that elections for the new assembly - the council of representatives as it is to be called - produced a 70 % turnout with no boycott by the sunnis .
the american view is that elections are like a magic wand and produce their own beneficial effect .
this may be so but elections have to produce viable governments .
an election in el salvador in 1982 went off well in terms of numbers but the civil war there went on for another decade .
if it took 10 years to pacify iraq , it might not be so bad in terms of time historically , but in terms of casualties it would be tragic .
long road to government the turnout in iraq therefore will now have to be converted into a functional government and the timetable could stretch out for some time - up to three months or so if there is serious disagreement - because so many procedures have to be gone through first .
some sunni and secular parties allege the election was tainted the results have to be formally declared , the parties have to negotiate for a coalition , a presidential council has to be selected and then a prime minister and a government .
the results so far indicate that iraqis voted according to sectional and religious interests .
the us ambassador in baghdad , zalmay khalilzad , said : " it looks as if people have preferred to vote for their ethnic or sectarian identities , but for iraq to succeed there has to be cross-ethnic and cross-sectarian co-operation . "
so the shias dominate , the kurds are a strong minority , the secular are suffering but the sunnis are protesting .
indeed the main sunni grouping , the iraq accord front , claiming fraud , is threatening to boycott the assembly if there is no re-run vote in some areas .
since there will be no re-run , it remains to be seen if this threat will be put into practice .
" we 're going to have to face the fact that there are strong centrifugal forces in iraq that have the potential of tearing the country apart , " james dobbins , a former us diplomat in the balkans and now with the rand corporation , said in the los angeles times .
and even if the sunnis do join the assembly , it may be that they are simply opening up a new front to urge the removal of us and other foreign forces .
it does not mean that the insurgency will end .
the election may be over but the war is not .
security what also has to happen , in the view of british and us officials , is that the shias have to bend a bit and offer the sunnis more in talks about amending the constitution .
a move on the distribution of oil wealth to share out future discoveries more evenly would help .
on the security front , much remains to be done .
the plan is that the iraqis should take over progressively but the implementation has been weak because of the poor state of the iraqi police .
us troop levels are higher than they were two years ago if this process can be improved , then some troops are likely to go but this should not be mistaken for a withdrawal .
even if a few thousand us soldiers left now , the troop levels would still be higher than they were two years ago .
2005 has been a difficult year in iraq but the place has still amazingly held together despite the worst efforts of abu musab al-zarqawi and his al-qaeda cohorts .
it is instructive to note the language they use in the statements they issue on the internet and how it could not be less amenable to dialogue .
the shias are termed " the grandchildren of the al-alqami " , which is a derogatory term for shias and a reference to ibn al-alqami , a shia minister who was accused of betraying the caliph during the mongol huluqu 's attack on baghdad in 1258 .
iraqi political leaders are " polytheists " who took part in the " prostitution wedding of heresy and immorality " or elections .
the iraqi security forces are " pagan " and the foreign troops of course are the " crusaders " .
we will hear more such terminology in the coming year .
the question is whether these forces can be so isolated that they cease to have a significant effect .
much of the insurgency is carried on by sunnis not motivated by such extreme ideals and who are more concerned with foreign occupation and the protection of their own communities and interests .
if the new government can give these people hope , then iraq will have some hope .

"
following the make poverty history campaign , the world 's richest nations - the g8 - agreed a package of measures to cancel the debts and increase aid for some of the world 's poorest nations .

the harlequin species , which arrived two years ago from continental europe , is larger than british varieties and threatens them by taking their food .
the seven spot and the two spot , which until recently were common , are under threat along with the rarer five spot .
charity buglife wants the government to do more to protect these uk varieties .
everyone should be vigilant for the species and record where it is matt shardlow buglife the peterborough-based charity , also known as the invertebrate conservation trust , says the harlequin also damages crops by eating fruit .
huge appetite a survey was launched at the national history museum back in march to track the spread of the voracious predator known to easily out-compete home bugs for food .
wildlife enthusiasts were asked to monitor their gardens for the harlequin which is black and red or orange and black .
how to spot a harlequin tends to be rounder in shape than most uk native species about 5-8mm in size - similar to the common seven spot it has a white plate with a big black m-shaped marking on it , just behind the head sighted bugs can be orange with between 15 and 20 spots others may be black with two orange or red spots some also seen to be black with four orange or red spots buglife director matt shardlow said at the time : " the harlequin may sound like a bit of a jester but there is nothing funny about it at all .
" there 're a whole lot of problems it will bring with it .
it out-competes native species and eats them .
" everyone should be vigilant for the species and record where it is . "
the insect - originally from south-east asia - has a huge appetite for greenfly , leaving little for native ladybirds who then starve .
worse still , organisers of the survey said , the harlequin would turn on other ladybirds if food resources diminished for the whole population .
the invader will also prey on other types of insects , eating butterfly eggs , caterpillars and lacewing larvae .

after seeing the killer of 22-year-old marie jailed for life for her murder on 28 june 1992 , mr hines began a journey to unite the families of murder and manslaughter victims .
he launched the south-tyneside based north of england victims ' association -lrb- neva -rrb- , the uk 's only organisation fighting solely for families affected by murder .
" i was n't going to let a murderer beat me psychologically and i just felt i had to do something , first for my family and then for society , " mr hines told the bbc news website .

dave hines , third left , with neva families besides the emotional impact of murder , mr hines said families often faced problems holding down job and bringing up the children of victims .
" murder has a ripple effect - for every murder hundreds of people are affected indirectly , but does anyone care enough about us ? "
