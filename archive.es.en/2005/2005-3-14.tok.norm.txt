it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .

" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .

fraport sees shipping as its next big area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible takeover by lufthansa may have swiss tails in the air the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .
the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .

it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .
the -lrb- bad -rrb- condition of that airport is known worldwide .
for us it is clear what needs to be done . ...
only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .
it has already begun doing security checks at a cruise ship terminal in bremerhaven .
if all goes well , it will be another growth market for fraport , since the future in that sector looks bright indeed . monika lohmüller -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fraport wants stake in indian airport the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .

the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .

it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .
the -lrb- bad -rrb- condition of that airport is known worldwide .
for us it is clear what needs to be done . ...
only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .
it has already begun doing security checks at a cruise ship terminal in bremerhaven .

luxury car maker porsche pledged to fight such a law in german and european courts .
porsche 's chief , wendelin wiedeking , who is thought to earn more than € 15 million -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- , said the measure will lead to to " socialism " in the boardroom , by forcing salaries to match in order to prevent envy and resentment . the government initiative , proposed last week , would require disclosure of individual executive salaries , bonuses and other benefits such as stock options .
voluntary reporting unsatisfactory german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced the legislation after a failed effort by the government to entice the majority of companies to voluntarily report salaries .
currently , about one-third of germany 's top corporations disclose their salaries . " i regret that companies did n't meet their voluntary commitment , " she said , calling the initiative important for shareholders . but industry leaders said they would only comply if forced to . " we think the proposal does n't make sense , " a spokesman for bmw chief told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung daily sunday . chemicals maker basf 's supervisory board chair jürgen hambrecht agreed and said that such oversight was the responsibility of the board . standard practice elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann signals victory before his trial on charges of improperly approving large executive payments during a high-stakes takeover deal .
the trial focused the nation 's attention on boardroom behavior and transparency issues officials responded to criticism by pointing out that such disclosures are part of standard business practices in the united states , canada , and other european countries such as the united kingdom , france , italy , the netherlands and sweden . and only in germany would such a law include an option for companies not to disclose if shareholders in a 75 percent majority voted not to require it .
it is unclear when the initiative will be introduced in parliament .
to become law , it must be approved by the cabinet and the lower house of parliament . public pressure for more transparency was spurred by criminal trials over payments to executives at mobile phone company mannesmann during a merger with britain 's vodafone group last year .
six executives and board members were acquitted in july . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de salary secrecy haunts german business leaders most companies listed on the german stock index violate germany 's corporate governance codex because they have a mutual agreement not to reveal salaries for top executives , according to the man who wrote the codex .

luxury car maker porsche pledged to fight such a law in german and european courts .
porsche 's chief , wendelin wiedeking , who is thought to earn more than € 15 million -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- , said the measure will lead to to " socialism " in the boardroom , by forcing salaries to match in order to prevent envy and resentment . the government initiative , proposed last week , would require disclosure of individual executive salaries , bonuses and other benefits such as stock options .
voluntary reporting unsatisfactory german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced the legislation after a failed effort by the government to entice the majority of companies to voluntarily report salaries .
currently , about one-third of germany 's top corporations disclose their salaries . " i regret that companies did n't meet their voluntary commitment , " she said , calling the initiative important for shareholders . but industry leaders said they would only comply if forced to . " we think the proposal does n't make sense , " a spokesman for bmw chief told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung daily sunday . chemicals maker basf 's supervisory board chair jürgen hambrecht agreed and said that such oversight was the responsibility of the board . standard practice elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann signals victory before his trial on charges of improperly approving large executive payments during a high-stakes takeover deal .
the trial focused the nation 's attention on boardroom behavior and transparency issues officials responded to criticism by pointing out that such disclosures are part of standard business practices in the united states , canada , and other european countries such as the united kingdom , france , italy , the netherlands and sweden . and only in germany would such a law include an option for companies not to disclose if shareholders in a 75 percent majority voted not to require it .
it is unclear when the initiative will be introduced in parliament .
to become law , it must be approved by the cabinet and the lower house of parliament . public pressure for more transparency was spurred by criminal trials over payments to executives at mobile phone company mannesmann during a merger with britain 's vodafone group last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible takeover by lufthansa may have swiss tails in the air the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .
the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

11 , 2001 , attacks , the german government plans to extend them and add others , such as allowing law enforcement officials to examine suspects ' bank accounts . according to news reports , german interior minister otto schily plans to introduce a constitutional amendment that would allow germany 's navy to fend off a terrorist attack from the sea . this would compliment an existing law that enables the government to shoot down a civilian airplane in case it has been hijacked by terrorists who plan to crash it into a building .
the latter law is already being challenged in germany 's constitutional court . ' security package iii ' in a proposed package of measures known as " security package iii , " schily is pushing for intelligence agencies to have easier access to bank account information , and for fewer bureaucratic hurdles in the area of surveillance , according to a report in the newsmagazine spiegel .
along with with german justice minister brigitte zypries , schily has met with telecommunication industry officials to discuss storing data for longer periods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily -lrb- left -rrb- and german justice minister brigitte zypries so far , information is only kept for 90 days , but schily and zypries support storing telecommunications and internet data for up to a year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible takeover by lufthansa may have swiss tails in the air the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .
the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .

luxury car maker porsche pledged to fight such a law in german and european courts .
porsche 's chief , wendelin wiedeking , who is thought to earn more than € 15 million -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- , said the measure will lead to to " socialism " in the boardroom , by forcing salaries to match in order to prevent envy and resentment . the government initiative , proposed last week , would require disclosure of individual executive salaries , bonuses and other benefits such as stock options .
voluntary reporting unsatisfactory german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced the legislation after a failed effort by the government to entice the majority of companies to voluntarily report salaries .
currently , about one-third of germany 's top corporations disclose their salaries . " i regret that companies did n't meet their voluntary commitment , " she said , calling the initiative important for shareholders . but industry leaders said they would only comply if forced to . " we think the proposal does n't make sense , " a spokesman for bmw chief told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung daily sunday . chemicals maker basf 's supervisory board chair jürgen hambrecht agreed and said that such oversight was the responsibility of the board . standard practice elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann signals victory before his trial on charges of improperly approving large executive payments during a high-stakes takeover deal .
the trial focused the nation 's attention on boardroom behavior and transparency issues officials responded to criticism by pointing out that such disclosures are part of standard business practices in the united states , canada , and other european countries such as the united kingdom , france , italy , the netherlands and sweden . and only in germany would such a law include an option for companies not to disclose if shareholders in a 75 percent majority voted not to require it .
it is unclear when the initiative will be introduced in parliament .
to become law , it must be approved by the cabinet and the lower house of parliament . public pressure for more transparency was spurred by criminal trials over payments to executives at mobile phone company mannesmann during a merger with britain 's vodafone group last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.03.2005 a secular rite of passage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating their big day while some atheist communities mark the transition from childhood to adulthood with the acknowledgement of growing pains , germany 's faithless are initiated into the grown-up world by means of an official ceremony . germany has a long and loving relationship with the tradition of both catholic and protestant confirmation , of awkward young teens taking to the altar in suits and frilly white dresses on their way towards becoming adults .
but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .

luxury car maker porsche pledged to fight such a law in german and european courts .
porsche 's chief , wendelin wiedeking , who is thought to earn more than € 15 million -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- , said the measure will lead to to " socialism " in the boardroom , by forcing salaries to match in order to prevent envy and resentment . the government initiative , proposed last week , would require disclosure of individual executive salaries , bonuses and other benefits such as stock options .
voluntary reporting unsatisfactory german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced the legislation after a failed effort by the government to entice the majority of companies to voluntarily report salaries .
currently , about one-third of germany 's top corporations disclose their salaries . " i regret that companies did n't meet their voluntary commitment , " she said , calling the initiative important for shareholders . but industry leaders said they would only comply if forced to . " we think the proposal does n't make sense , " a spokesman for bmw chief told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung daily sunday . chemicals maker basf 's supervisory board chair jürgen hambrecht agreed and said that such oversight was the responsibility of the board . standard practice elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann signals victory before his trial on charges of improperly approving large executive payments during a high-stakes takeover deal .
the trial focused the nation 's attention on boardroom behavior and transparency issues officials responded to criticism by pointing out that such disclosures are part of standard business practices in the united states , canada , and other european countries such as the united kingdom , france , italy , the netherlands and sweden . and only in germany would such a law include an option for companies not to disclose if shareholders in a 75 percent majority voted not to require it .
it is unclear when the initiative will be introduced in parliament .
to become law , it must be approved by the cabinet and the lower house of parliament . public pressure for more transparency was spurred by criminal trials over payments to executives at mobile phone company mannesmann during a merger with britain 's vodafone group last year .
six executives and board members were acquitted in july . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de salary secrecy haunts german business leaders most companies listed on the german stock index violate germany 's corporate governance codex because they have a mutual agreement not to reveal salaries for top executives , according to the man who wrote the codex .

but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .
but then again , is turning 14 really a mark of having made it into adulthood ? tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

the latter law is already being challenged in germany 's constitutional court .

luxury car maker porsche pledged to fight such a law in german and european courts .
porsche 's chief , wendelin wiedeking , who is thought to earn more than € 15 million -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- , said the measure will lead to to " socialism " in the boardroom , by forcing salaries to match in order to prevent envy and resentment . the government initiative , proposed last week , would require disclosure of individual executive salaries , bonuses and other benefits such as stock options .
voluntary reporting unsatisfactory german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced the legislation after a failed effort by the government to entice the majority of companies to voluntarily report salaries .
currently , about one-third of germany 's top corporations disclose their salaries . " i regret that companies did n't meet their voluntary commitment , " she said , calling the initiative important for shareholders . but industry leaders said they would only comply if forced to . " we think the proposal does n't make sense , " a spokesman for bmw chief told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung daily sunday . chemicals maker basf 's supervisory board chair jürgen hambrecht agreed and said that such oversight was the responsibility of the board . standard practice elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann signals victory before his trial on charges of improperly approving large executive payments during a high-stakes takeover deal .
the trial focused the nation 's attention on boardroom behavior and transparency issues officials responded to criticism by pointing out that such disclosures are part of standard business practices in the united states , canada , and other european countries such as the united kingdom , france , italy , the netherlands and sweden . and only in germany would such a law include an option for companies not to disclose if shareholders in a 75 percent majority voted not to require it .
it is unclear when the initiative will be introduced in parliament .
to become law , it must be approved by the cabinet and the lower house of parliament . public pressure for more transparency was spurred by criminal trials over payments to executives at mobile phone company mannesmann during a merger with britain 's vodafone group last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible takeover by lufthansa may have swiss tails in the air the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .
the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .

it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths .

andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .

but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .

it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .
the -lrb- bad -rrb- condition of that airport is known worldwide .
for us it is clear what needs to be done . ...
only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .
it has already begun doing security checks at a cruise ship terminal in bremerhaven .
if all goes well , it will be another growth market for fraport , since the future in that sector looks bright indeed . monika lohmüller -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fraport wants stake in indian airport the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .

the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

luxury car maker porsche pledged to fight such a law in german and european courts .
porsche 's chief , wendelin wiedeking , who is thought to earn more than € 15 million -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- , said the measure will lead to to " socialism " in the boardroom , by forcing salaries to match in order to prevent envy and resentment . the government initiative , proposed last week , would require disclosure of individual executive salaries , bonuses and other benefits such as stock options .
voluntary reporting unsatisfactory german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced the legislation after a failed effort by the government to entice the majority of companies to voluntarily report salaries .
currently , about one-third of germany 's top corporations disclose their salaries . " i regret that companies did n't meet their voluntary commitment , " she said , calling the initiative important for shareholders . but industry leaders said they would only comply if forced to . " we think the proposal does n't make sense , " a spokesman for bmw chief told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung daily sunday . chemicals maker basf 's supervisory board chair jürgen hambrecht agreed and said that such oversight was the responsibility of the board . standard practice elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann signals victory before his trial on charges of improperly approving large executive payments during a high-stakes takeover deal .
the trial focused the nation 's attention on boardroom behavior and transparency issues officials responded to criticism by pointing out that such disclosures are part of standard business practices in the united states , canada , and other european countries such as the united kingdom , france , italy , the netherlands and sweden . and only in germany would such a law include an option for companies not to disclose if shareholders in a 75 percent majority voted not to require it .
it is unclear when the initiative will be introduced in parliament .
to become law , it must be approved by the cabinet and the lower house of parliament . public pressure for more transparency was spurred by criminal trials over payments to executives at mobile phone company mannesmann during a merger with britain 's vodafone group last year .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .
the süddeutsche zeitung called karlsch 's discoveries new but , as of yet , unproven .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that the book 's title was misleading . hoffmann of the max planck institute agreed with that assessment , saying he though the publisher 's choice of title , " hitler 's bomb , " was an unfortunate one . " hitler 's bomb or a real fusion bomb -lrb- created by the nazis -rrb- most likely did n't exist , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a monster 's private voice a recording of adolf hitler talking about his feelings towards the war has resurfaced some 62 years after it was secretly taped by a sound engineer while the nazi dictator was visiting finland in 1942 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 good times for airport operator fraport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the mammoth a380 will be at home in frankfurt with record profits and a growing international profile , airport operator fraport is a bright spot on germany 's bleak business landscape . in recent years , airport operator fraport - which runs the massive frankfurt international airport in frankfurt am main - has managed to avoid the economic dire straits plaguing most large , listed german firms .
it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .
the süddeutsche zeitung called karlsch 's discoveries new but , as of yet , unproven .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that the book 's title was misleading . hoffmann of the max planck institute agreed with that assessment , saying he though the publisher 's choice of title , " hitler 's bomb , " was an unfortunate one .

porsche 's chief , wendelin wiedeking , who is thought to earn more than € 15 million -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- , said the measure will lead to to " socialism " in the boardroom , by forcing salaries to match in order to prevent envy and resentment . the government initiative , proposed last week , would require disclosure of individual executive salaries , bonuses and other benefits such as stock options .
voluntary reporting unsatisfactory german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced the legislation after a failed effort by the government to entice the majority of companies to voluntarily report salaries .
currently , about one-third of germany 's top corporations disclose their salaries . " i regret that companies did n't meet their voluntary commitment , " she said , calling the initiative important for shareholders . but industry leaders said they would only comply if forced to . " we think the proposal does n't make sense , " a spokesman for bmw chief told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung daily sunday . chemicals maker basf 's supervisory board chair jürgen hambrecht agreed and said that such oversight was the responsibility of the board . standard practice elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann signals victory before his trial on charges of improperly approving large executive payments during a high-stakes takeover deal .
the trial focused the nation 's attention on boardroom behavior and transparency issues officials responded to criticism by pointing out that such disclosures are part of standard business practices in the united states , canada , and other european countries such as the united kingdom , france , italy , the netherlands and sweden . and only in germany would such a law include an option for companies not to disclose if shareholders in a 75 percent majority voted not to require it .
it is unclear when the initiative will be introduced in parliament .
to become law , it must be approved by the cabinet and the lower house of parliament . public pressure for more transparency was spurred by criminal trials over payments to executives at mobile phone company mannesmann during a merger with britain 's vodafone group last year .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .
the süddeutsche zeitung called karlsch 's discoveries new but , as of yet , unproven .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that the book 's title was misleading . hoffmann of the max planck institute agreed with that assessment , saying he though the publisher 's choice of title , " hitler 's bomb , " was an unfortunate one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 good times for airport operator fraport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the mammoth a380 will be at home in frankfurt with record profits and a growing international profile , airport operator fraport is a bright spot on germany 's bleak business landscape . in recent years , airport operator fraport - which runs the massive frankfurt international airport in frankfurt am main - has managed to avoid the economic dire straits plaguing most large , listed german firms .
it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .

" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him .

it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .
the -lrb- bad -rrb- condition of that airport is known worldwide .
for us it is clear what needs to be done . ...
only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .
it has already begun doing security checks at a cruise ship terminal in bremerhaven .
if all goes well , it will be another growth market for fraport , since the future in that sector looks bright indeed . monika lohmüller -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fraport wants stake in indian airport the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 good times for airport operator fraport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the mammoth a380 will be at home in frankfurt with record profits and a growing international profile , airport operator fraport is a bright spot on germany 's bleak business landscape . in recent years , airport operator fraport - which runs the massive frankfurt international airport in frankfurt am main - has managed to avoid the economic dire straits plaguing most large , listed german firms .
it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .
the -lrb- bad -rrb- condition of that airport is known worldwide .
for us it is clear what needs to be done . ...
only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .
it has already begun doing security checks at a cruise ship terminal in bremerhaven .
if all goes well , it will be another growth market for fraport , since the future in that sector looks bright indeed . monika lohmüller -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fraport wants stake in indian airport the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible takeover by lufthansa may have swiss tails in the air the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .
the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .
the -lrb- bad -rrb- condition of that airport is known worldwide .
for us it is clear what needs to be done . ...
only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .
it has already begun doing security checks at a cruise ship terminal in bremerhaven .
if all goes well , it will be another growth market for fraport , since the future in that sector looks bright indeed . monika lohmüller -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fraport wants stake in indian airport the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .

lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .

the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .

for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .

" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .

it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .

only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible takeover by lufthansa may have swiss tails in the air the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .
the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .

but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .
the süddeutsche zeitung called karlsch 's discoveries new but , as of yet , unproven .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that the book 's title was misleading . hoffmann of the max planck institute agreed with that assessment , saying he though the publisher 's choice of title , " hitler 's bomb , " was an unfortunate one .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .
the süddeutsche zeitung called karlsch 's discoveries new but , as of yet , unproven .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that the book 's title was misleading . hoffmann of the max planck institute agreed with that assessment , saying he though the publisher 's choice of title , " hitler 's bomb , " was an unfortunate one .

it is unclear when the initiative will be introduced in parliament .

but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .

but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .

it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .

" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .
the süddeutsche zeitung called karlsch 's discoveries new but , as of yet , unproven .

fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .
the -lrb- bad -rrb- condition of that airport is known worldwide .
for us it is clear what needs to be done . ...
only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .
it has already begun doing security checks at a cruise ship terminal in bremerhaven .

fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .
the -lrb- bad -rrb- condition of that airport is known worldwide .
for us it is clear what needs to be done . ...
only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .
it has already begun doing security checks at a cruise ship terminal in bremerhaven .
if all goes well , it will be another growth market for fraport , since the future in that sector looks bright indeed . monika lohmüller -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fraport wants stake in indian airport the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .

the latter law is already being challenged in germany 's constitutional court .

schily presented a report on anti-terror measures to a parliamentary committee which concludes that authorities have used their new tools " responsibly and carefully . " the law changes made it easier for investigators to review suspects ' telecommunications , among other things .

despite some problems , rfid looks set to become part of all our lives . wandering the cavernous halls of the cebit trade fair , one may walk past the future of computerized security and identification and not know it .
indeed , walking past the stand featuring the sap / intel rfid chip is about as close to the cutting edge as it gets . the german software giant sap and the american chip manufacturer intel announced a new strategic alliance at the it trade fair in hanover this week .
they hope that the rfid - radio-frequency identification - technology will take the security sector by storm by offering applications for everything from cattle tagging to event ticket sales . " with rfid , you can monitor the whereabouts of products in a warehouse or the price and transmit that product information , " technology expert jürgen kuri told deutsche welle . according to the manufacturers , monitoring stock would be one of the most basic applications but one of its most commercially successful .
the implications for large chain stores would be immense .
the us giant wal-mart already uses the technology in its warehouse . stock application aids efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rfid technology makes scanning large amounts of stock and sorting and distributing products simpler and faster .
the chip transmits information needed to efficiently locate , pack and send wares on their way quickly and easily . however , the rfid chips can do more than just help in the logging of products .
" the chips can be used , for example , in electronic identity cards , biometric systems , even in tickets for the world cup , " jürgen kuri added .
" however , if one buys a ticket or product with a chip installed , it would have to be destroyed afterwards to avoid any further information being released . " it is a sensitive issue that sap and intel are trying to address .
" for this reason we have begun an initiative with a number of organizations to secure the rfid from hackers and to protect data security and the private sphere , " sap 's christoph lessmöllmann said chip security open to hackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , there remains at this time no concrete protection against hackers .
it appears that vigilance , at the moment , is the best defense .
" wherever there is data stored , there is a risk of illegal practice , " jürgen kuri commented .
" therefore , the simplest principle of modern data security is avoiding people getting to the data . " despite the work-in-progress nature of the security measures of the chips themselves , the business implications for the technology are as potentially huge as the number of applications .
idtechex , a management consultancy from cambridge , massachusetts , estimates that the global rfid market by 2008 will exceed $ 7 billion . at the moment , the chips are still relatively expensive but sap is working together with intel to remedy this as fast as possible .
" we hope that the massive demand for the chips will eventually help us cut the production costs , " lessmöllmann said . rolf wenkel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .

despite some problems , rfid looks set to become part of all our lives . wandering the cavernous halls of the cebit trade fair , one may walk past the future of computerized security and identification and not know it .
indeed , walking past the stand featuring the sap / intel rfid chip is about as close to the cutting edge as it gets . the german software giant sap and the american chip manufacturer intel announced a new strategic alliance at the it trade fair in hanover this week .
they hope that the rfid - radio-frequency identification - technology will take the security sector by storm by offering applications for everything from cattle tagging to event ticket sales . " with rfid , you can monitor the whereabouts of products in a warehouse or the price and transmit that product information , " technology expert jürgen kuri told deutsche welle . according to the manufacturers , monitoring stock would be one of the most basic applications but one of its most commercially successful .
the implications for large chain stores would be immense .
the us giant wal-mart already uses the technology in its warehouse . stock application aids efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rfid technology makes scanning large amounts of stock and sorting and distributing products simpler and faster .
the chip transmits information needed to efficiently locate , pack and send wares on their way quickly and easily . however , the rfid chips can do more than just help in the logging of products .
" the chips can be used , for example , in electronic identity cards , biometric systems , even in tickets for the world cup , " jürgen kuri added .
" however , if one buys a ticket or product with a chip installed , it would have to be destroyed afterwards to avoid any further information being released . " it is a sensitive issue that sap and intel are trying to address .
" for this reason we have begun an initiative with a number of organizations to secure the rfid from hackers and to protect data security and the private sphere , " sap 's christoph lessmöllmann said chip security open to hackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , there remains at this time no concrete protection against hackers .
it appears that vigilance , at the moment , is the best defense .
" wherever there is data stored , there is a risk of illegal practice , " jürgen kuri commented .
" therefore , the simplest principle of modern data security is avoiding people getting to the data . " despite the work-in-progress nature of the security measures of the chips themselves , the business implications for the technology are as potentially huge as the number of applications .
idtechex , a management consultancy from cambridge , massachusetts , estimates that the global rfid market by 2008 will exceed $ 7 billion . at the moment , the chips are still relatively expensive but sap is working together with intel to remedy this as fast as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.03.2005 a secular rite of passage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating their big day while some atheist communities mark the transition from childhood to adulthood with the acknowledgement of growing pains , germany 's faithless are initiated into the grown-up world by means of an official ceremony . germany has a long and loving relationship with the tradition of both catholic and protestant confirmation , of awkward young teens taking to the altar in suits and frilly white dresses on their way towards becoming adults .
but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .
but then again , is turning 14 really a mark of having made it into adulthood ? tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

the chip transmits information needed to efficiently locate , pack and send wares on their way quickly and easily . however , the rfid chips can do more than just help in the logging of products .
" the chips can be used , for example , in electronic identity cards , biometric systems , even in tickets for the world cup , " jürgen kuri added .
" however , if one buys a ticket or product with a chip installed , it would have to be destroyed afterwards to avoid any further information being released . " it is a sensitive issue that sap and intel are trying to address .
" for this reason we have begun an initiative with a number of organizations to secure the rfid from hackers and to protect data security and the private sphere , " sap 's christoph lessmöllmann said chip security open to hackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , there remains at this time no concrete protection against hackers .
it appears that vigilance , at the moment , is the best defense .
" wherever there is data stored , there is a risk of illegal practice , " jürgen kuri commented .
" therefore , the simplest principle of modern data security is avoiding people getting to the data . " despite the work-in-progress nature of the security measures of the chips themselves , the business implications for the technology are as potentially huge as the number of applications .
idtechex , a management consultancy from cambridge , massachusetts , estimates that the global rfid market by 2008 will exceed $ 7 billion . at the moment , the chips are still relatively expensive but sap is working together with intel to remedy this as fast as possible .
" we hope that the massive demand for the chips will eventually help us cut the production costs , " lessmöllmann said . rolf wenkel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .

but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .

" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .
but then again , is turning 14 really a mark of having made it into adulthood ? tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

" however , if one buys a ticket or product with a chip installed , it would have to be destroyed afterwards to avoid any further information being released . " it is a sensitive issue that sap and intel are trying to address .
" for this reason we have begun an initiative with a number of organizations to secure the rfid from hackers and to protect data security and the private sphere , " sap 's christoph lessmöllmann said chip security open to hackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , there remains at this time no concrete protection against hackers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.03.2005 a secular rite of passage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating their big day while some atheist communities mark the transition from childhood to adulthood with the acknowledgement of growing pains , germany 's faithless are initiated into the grown-up world by means of an official ceremony . germany has a long and loving relationship with the tradition of both catholic and protestant confirmation , of awkward young teens taking to the altar in suits and frilly white dresses on their way towards becoming adults .
but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .

despite some problems , rfid looks set to become part of all our lives . wandering the cavernous halls of the cebit trade fair , one may walk past the future of computerized security and identification and not know it .
indeed , walking past the stand featuring the sap / intel rfid chip is about as close to the cutting edge as it gets . the german software giant sap and the american chip manufacturer intel announced a new strategic alliance at the it trade fair in hanover this week .
they hope that the rfid - radio-frequency identification - technology will take the security sector by storm by offering applications for everything from cattle tagging to event ticket sales . " with rfid , you can monitor the whereabouts of products in a warehouse or the price and transmit that product information , " technology expert jürgen kuri told deutsche welle . according to the manufacturers , monitoring stock would be one of the most basic applications but one of its most commercially successful .
the implications for large chain stores would be immense .
the us giant wal-mart already uses the technology in its warehouse . stock application aids efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rfid technology makes scanning large amounts of stock and sorting and distributing products simpler and faster .
the chip transmits information needed to efficiently locate , pack and send wares on their way quickly and easily . however , the rfid chips can do more than just help in the logging of products .
" the chips can be used , for example , in electronic identity cards , biometric systems , even in tickets for the world cup , " jürgen kuri added .
" however , if one buys a ticket or product with a chip installed , it would have to be destroyed afterwards to avoid any further information being released . " it is a sensitive issue that sap and intel are trying to address .
" for this reason we have begun an initiative with a number of organizations to secure the rfid from hackers and to protect data security and the private sphere , " sap 's christoph lessmöllmann said chip security open to hackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , there remains at this time no concrete protection against hackers .
it appears that vigilance , at the moment , is the best defense .
" wherever there is data stored , there is a risk of illegal practice , " jürgen kuri commented .
" therefore , the simplest principle of modern data security is avoiding people getting to the data . " despite the work-in-progress nature of the security measures of the chips themselves , the business implications for the technology are as potentially huge as the number of applications .
idtechex , a management consultancy from cambridge , massachusetts , estimates that the global rfid market by 2008 will exceed $ 7 billion . at the moment , the chips are still relatively expensive but sap is working together with intel to remedy this as fast as possible .
" we hope that the massive demand for the chips will eventually help us cut the production costs , " lessmöllmann said . rolf wenkel -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .

the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .

but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .

but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .

" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .

swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2005 swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible takeover by lufthansa may have swiss tails in the air the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .
the reality is , swiss was forced to swallow its pride long ago and now faces its best offer in over four years of uncertainty . plans by german airline lufthansa to buy its ailing partner swiss will speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as scheduled carriers join forces to battle their low-cost rivals , analysts have said . but if the deal goes through and swiss - the successor company to former flag carrier swissair which went bust in 2001 - is integrated into the wider lufthansa group , what does the takeover mean for switzerland ? in purely business terms , the deal from the swiss perspective would be a sweet one . lufthansa and swiss have long been seen as potential bedfellows .
previous merger talks between the two in 2003 were scuppered by strong resistance in switzerland , after which swiss tried - ultimately unsuccessfully - to join british airways ' oneworld alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , lufthansa has always insisted that it has never closed the door completely on a deal with swiss , as long as the terms and conditions were right .
in the past , lufthansa has tended to steer clear of big acquisitions , opting instead for code-sharing agreements under the umbrella of its star alliance grouping .
but in the case of loss-making swiss , greater synergies would be gained from a straight-forward takeover , analysts argued . " strategically , a tie-up would make sense , " said nordlb analyst martina noss .
lufthansa would be able to get its hands on the hub of zurich , as well as on swiss 's valuable business clients , and it would be taking over a rival with overlapping routes , she said . exane-bnp paribas analyst nick van den brul said that a merger would also be beneficial to loss-making swiss .
" it 's not expensive for lufthansa and it provides prospects for swiss , " he said . life insurance for swiss hvb analyst uwe weinrich agreed .
" lufthansa will act as some sort of life insurance policy for swiss , " which managed to narrow its losses last year , but still ended the year in the red , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierre-yves savidan , airline expert with management consultancy bipe , said that a key advantage for lufthansa would be the hub of zurich .
" zurich could become a second regional for lufthansa after munich , or it could even serve as its intercontinental hub if a third runway is not built in frankfurt , " savidan said . lufthansa has promised to maintain swiss as an independent brand underneath the lufthansa umbrella .
" it 's a quality brand , " savidan said .
and at a time when lufthansa is increasingly targeting high-paying customers , the swiss image could prove an attractive crowd puller . everyone 's a winner ? analyst jan herbst also saw a tie-up as a good idea .
" lufthansa would be the leading player in central europe , " he said .
" even if swiss succeeds in returning to profitability , it will not be able to keep its stand-alone position long term .
time is therefore on lufthansa 's side , " herbst said . despite all the positive economic and business noises being made , the takeover would mean the end of switzerland 's direct association with the airline industry .
sadly , the swiss have been watching helplessly as a symbol of their national identity has slowly eroded over the last four years . swissair collapse starts the descent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the swiss , the autumn of 2001 was the beginning of the end .
swissair finally succumbed to financial ailments and collapsed .
from the ashes of the national carrier , mainly thanks to a package put together by the swiss government , swissair 's daughter company crossair rose to the challenge and , under the name of swiss , was remodeled as the nation 's airline . it was a matter of national pride , although one that the contributing banks were told would result in little or no return on their investment . in april 2002 , swiss took to the skies with the former swissair fleet and staff at its disposal .
however , it soon became very clear that swiss would be too small a company to be competitive in the world market .
slashing prices to attract customers just brought about further hemorrhaging ; swiss dived further into the red . pride replaced by survival instinct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors stayed away in droves .
swiss looked to be going the same way as its predecessor and switzerland 's own confidence was shaken as it became clear that the airline would not survive without exterior help .
by the summer of 2003 , swiss was looking to join oneworld .
but that bid failed and the airline continued to plummet . now swiss has a chance to survive ; swiss jobs will be saved and the flag will still be flown , albeit under the lufthansa banner .
with national pride abandoned long ago for the harsh realities of business , swiss has the opportunity to fly again and to start a new chapter . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa wants swiss german carrier lufthansa on sunday confirmed reports that it plans to take over ailing swiss airlines .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .
the süddeutsche zeitung called karlsch 's discoveries new but , as of yet , unproven .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that the book 's title was misleading . hoffmann of the max planck institute agreed with that assessment , saying he though the publisher 's choice of title , " hitler 's bomb , " was an unfortunate one . " hitler 's bomb or a real fusion bomb -lrb- created by the nazis -rrb- most likely did n't exist , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a monster 's private voice a recording of adolf hitler talking about his feelings towards the war has resurfaced some 62 years after it was secretly taped by a sound engineer while the nazi dictator was visiting finland in 1942 .

a new book by a berlin historian claims nazi germany built and tested nuclear weapons before the end of world war ii .
the claims , if true , would mean a rewriting of history , but many have doubts about the theory . it is well known that the nazis were investigating the development of atomic weapons in the final months of the war .
they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .
the süddeutsche zeitung called karlsch 's discoveries new but , as of yet , unproven .

they were desperately seeking a " miracle weapon " that could turn the devastating tide of destruction that was descending upon germany as allied forces closed in from both the east and west . but most historians have said the third reich , which was badly overstretched regarding material resources as the war wound down , was far from taking on the united states in a nuclear confrontation . not so , according to berlin-based historian rainer karlsch , who says in his 400-page book entitled " hitler 's bomb " that there was likely a functioning nuclear reactor near the german capital and that the regime 's scientists actually tested nuclear devices in the state of thuringia and on the baltic sea island of rügen . brink of nuclear catastrophe ? it sounds like a nightmare scenario , which , if true , could have meant the world stood on the threshold of nuclear catastrophe in 1945 , since in the dying days of the war , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler promised that if he went down , he would bring half of world down with him . " german scientists succeeded in releasing nuclear energy in the fall of 1944 , three-quarters of a year before the americans , " said karlsch at a press conference on monday at the book 's official release . the historian trawled through little known russian archival material to back up much of his theory , as well as radiation measurements , soil analyses and the testimony of first and second-hand witnesses . karlsch says in the book that the german weapons , while never used during the war , did have deadly effects .
a test in thuringia , according to him , killed some 500 people , mostly prisoners of war . despite the sensational title of the book , which has been the topic of much debate in the press for several weeks , karlsch told monday 's press conference that the nazi weapons could better be described as atomic " grenades , " but that their significance should not be played down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toward the end of the war , the germans were desperately looking for a " miracle weapon " that could bring them victory .
karlsch says they almost found it .
" there were heading in the direction of a serviceable nuclear weapon , " he said . he does admit , however , that he has little proof for his theories , but rather that his research has pointed to a strong chain of indications . hefty criticism that lack of hard-and-fast proof has led to much skepticism about the book , in the press as well as among the scientific community .
while the book has attracted the attention of scholars , some of whom have praised karlsch for his doggedness in combing through dusty russian archives and turning up previously unknown material , most are not ready to follow his down his theoretical path . " in germany , uranium fission was discovered in 1938 or ' 39 , " said dieter hoffmann , a researcher at berlin 's max planck institute for scientific history .
" however , that here in the 1940s a nuclear bomb was set off still seems to me implausible . " # b # gerd fussmann , a physicist at berlin 's humboldt university , is also not completely convinced .
" we only have the testimony of lay people and speculation based on historical documents , " he said . " because of that , there is still going to be a good deal of doubt , whether we 're really talking about nuclear weapons here . " the press has been even harder on karlsch .
the newsmagazine der spiegel claimed the author can not back up his spectacular claims .
the süddeutsche zeitung called karlsch 's discoveries new but , as of yet , unproven .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that the book 's title was misleading . hoffmann of the max planck institute agreed with that assessment , saying he though the publisher 's choice of title , " hitler 's bomb , " was an unfortunate one .

the german cities all recorded a score of 113 points .
the world 's safest city is luxembourg while , unsurprisingly , baghdad is the most dangerous .
while the german cities fared well , rome , athens and london performed badly compared to other western european locations because of high levels of petty crime , while madrid scored poorly because of terrorism , the report showed .
" the top-ranking cities for personal safety and security are in politically stable countries with good international relations and sustainable economic growth , " said slagin parakatil , senior researcher at mercer on the company 's web site . dw-world.de german standard of living in decline not only do more germans think their standard of living is worsening , but it actually is , a bi-annual report compiled by three research german institutes revealed monday .

it recorded a highest ever € 150 million -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- net profit in 2004 .
the company also saw record traffic , with 51 million passengers going through its terminal - the first time the 50 million mark has been surpassed .
fraport also had its best-ever shipping results that year , moving 1.75 million tons of freight , up 13 percent from 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminal 1 in frankfurt airport , february .
passenger numbers are up .
fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .

" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .

there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .

fraport sees shipping as its next big area .

fraport , which also runs the frankfurt hahn airport in the hunsrück region , went public in 2001 .
since then it has been increasingly active internationally .
there is no question that huge new airbus 380 super jumbo jet , which can seat up to 880 passengers , will take off and land at the airport in frankfurt am main .
but in order for this to happen , the plane needs an expanded landing strip , a new terminal , and a hangar for the " giant of the air . "
all in a day 's work to achieve all this , fraport - europe 's second-largest airport operator after the british airport authority in london - will have to jump a few hurdles .
for example , they will need to overcome the opposition of environmentalists in order to cut down forests .
in the end , several hundred thousand people in the rhine-main are likely to try and stop fraport from building the larger landing strip .
but that 's all in a day 's work for a company that runs an airport the size of a city and that employs some 13,000 of frankfurt 's 65,000 workers overall .
the company was created in 1924 to manage the airport in frankfurt .
today , the multifaceted organization operates flights and traffic and manages real estate and rental property , among other things .
in the past few years , it has been increasingly testing the waters of consulting and marketing , and has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at frankfurt international airport the firm is active in airports in lima , peru , and antalya , turkey , said fraport executive andrea pal .
for the past eight years , fraport has managed the cairo airport , and now it is mentoring the egyptian locals .
" in the training program , groups of egyptian managers will come to frankfurt .
they will learn about strategic topics , about business development , about where you need to be active to develop the business , " pal said .
fraport is also bidding for segments of foreign markets , for example seeking partial stakes in airports in delhi and budapest , pal said .
and the company has been working closely with the tokyo airport .
" we have a cooperation -lrb- in tokyo -rrb- , " said pal .
" the people in narita want to become listed , and they want to know how we managed in 2001 . ...
and we have to get them to answer specific questions about how they will solve operational problems in their airports . "
no thrilla in manilla but business has n't always been perfect at fraport .
the biggest flop so far was the company 's involvement in manila , which led to a fraport write-off of nearly € 300 million in 2003 .
the airport terminal building in the philippine capital was supposed to be a calling card for fraport 's international activities .
but the megaproject was stopped shortly before its opening , when a new government in manila failed to recognize the contracts fraport had signed with the building and operation consortium .
it was a loss for fraport , but also a lesson .
" you can never be sure other parities on such a project will stick to the rules .
in new agreements , we choose our partners carefully , and take care with how we formulate our contracts , " pal said .
a future in shipping one other difficulty is a hoped-for management takeover at the sheremetyevo international airport in moscow .
for years , there have been talks , contacts - and fraport is getting anxious .
" we have been trying for years to get that business going .
the -lrb- bad -rrb- condition of that airport is known worldwide .
for us it is clear what needs to be done . ...
only , in russia , management is constantly being replaced , having to do with political interests , friendships .
so i do n't know if we can really get a foot in the door there , " said pal .
fraport sees shipping as its next big area .
its subsidiary firm icts wants to provide security for cruise ships , pal explained .
it has already begun doing security checks at a cruise ship terminal in bremerhaven .
if all goes well , it will be another growth market for fraport , since the future in that sector looks bright indeed . monika lohmüller -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fraport wants stake in indian airport the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.03.2005 a secular rite of passage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating their big day while some atheist communities mark the transition from childhood to adulthood with the acknowledgement of growing pains , germany 's faithless are initiated into the grown-up world by means of an official ceremony . germany has a long and loving relationship with the tradition of both catholic and protestant confirmation , of awkward young teens taking to the altar in suits and frilly white dresses on their way towards becoming adults .
but what of those youngsters who are brought up with no religion , yet still wish to experience a similar rite of passage ?
the answer is a specially-designed ceremony known as the jugendweihe , or " youth consecration . " the german humanist association advertises for young jugendweihe recruits with the promise that " there is much to celebrate -lrb- and many presents -rrb- even without confirmation and communion . "
there must be some lure in those words for the nation 's teenage population , as one in every three youngsters in the states of the former east germany signs up to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime celebration . the 150-year-old ritual , which was mainly celebrated in eastern germany during the past 50 years is not without controversy : while supporters see it as a non-religious way to give teenagers a forum to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals , opponents see it as a left-over from communist days that merely give kids an opportunity to ask their relatives for presents . hard-wearing ritual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jugendweihe in the gdr originally established in the 19th century to replace the christian custom of confirmation , the ritual became an accepted tradition for teens aged 13 and 14 , who had no faith through which they could mark the passing of time . the tradition survived the weimar republic and fell into the hands of the nazis where it was tweaked and given the title " youth duty . "
rather than being buried under the rubble of the war , the jugendweihe was resurrected by the east german politburo . in the gdr , the concept took on a whole different meaning and was used by the state to create youth uniformity .
although it was not strictly speaking obligatory , the ceremony became so much a part of the fabric of society that those who did n't partake were the absolute anomalies . sandra wollgast , who grew up in eastern germany , was no exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast is still a popular jugendweihe venue " ninety-nine percent of east berliners had a jugendweihe , " she said .
" it held no political meaning for us , but was simply a day which we looked forward to , a day where everyone celebrated together .
it was great . " what she and doubtlessly many like her at the time did n't question was the meaning behind their big day .
it was just something which they were expected to do , and for which they were rewarded with material goods to boot . the modern version but that was then and this is contemporary unified germany .
the communist structures have gone and the church is back in the fray of the norm , but still the tradition lives on . bildunterschrift : not all youngsters feel the need to take part in jugendweihe for people like brigitte hillig , who still recall their own jugendweihe and would like their own children to have the same opportunities , there is no question that the tradition is every bit as important for non-religious youngsters as confirmation is for christian youths . " it is a way of leading children towards their adult life , of showing them that they are coming to a turning point , " she said .
" they see that they are growing up and the ceremony is a way of marking this change . " but not everyone is as ready to accept the ritual as part of germany 's national youth program .
andreas matthes grew up in western germany and said he finds the idea of jugendweihe dishonest . " most kids now do n't know the meaning of jugendweihe in communist east germany , because their parents do n't tell them that , " he said .
" they do n't tell them about the difficulties incurred for those who went to confirmation instead , and that is false . " morally challenged but both hillig and the president of the jugendweihe association , werner riedel argued that the 21st century event is a far cry from that of the old communist era .
in the nine months leading up to their big day , the youngsters can participate in any number of events which are designed to expand their minds , horizons and understanding of morals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german youngsters opt for confirmation but given that it is all on a voluntary basis , there is plenty of scope for those teenagers who want to make a quick buck with a relatively clean conscience to go ahead and do so .
and that is another one of the problems , matthes said . " there is no moral basis for the jugendweihe , because those who take part do n't have to do anything either before or after the event , " he said .
" and that renders it all so meaningless . " hillig would counter that such attitudes are based on aging prejudices about the former east germany . she may well have a point .
but then again , is turning 14 really a mark of having made it into adulthood ? tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

her statement comes after a public poll showed only 40 % of uk adults consider themselves well informed about science .
the mori poll also revealed that seven out of 10 adults think that the media sensationalises science issues .
however , eight out of 10 people do believe that science makes a valuable contribution to society .
trusting science " the uk has an excellent history of scientific achievement ; now is the time for greater engagement , " patricia hewitt said .
to encourage public engagement with science , lord sainsbury , the science minister , launched the sciencewise programme at the ba festival of science on 6 september 2004 .
sciencewise funding is aimed at organisations to support projects that build the capacity of scientists , policy-makers and citizens to engage in dialogue on scientific issues .
the poll , which was conducted last year , shows that , in some respects , the public attitude is warming towards science .
there has been an increase from 63 % to 70 % over the last five years in the level of trust in scientists to tell the truth .
on top of this , 56 % of adults have taken part in a science based activity - such as visiting a zoo , museum or planetarium - in the past year .
opportunities available " this report clearly shows a largely positive attitude among the uk public about science and perception of science issues , " said the chief scientific advisor , sir david king .
" public trust and confidence in science is generally high .
in order to build on this , the uk needs a mix of sustained funding , informed debate and sensible regulation . "
the report 's key findings : 70 % of uk adults trust scientists to tell the truth 80 % of adults think science makes a good contribution to society 56 % of adults have taken part in a science-based activity outside work in the last year 40 % of adults consider themselves well informed about science 70 % of people think the media sensationalises science issues .
national science week in the uk began on 11 march and runs to 20 march .

but any early attempts to do it - the uk 's home choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network .
now that broadband networks are bedding down , and it is becoming essential for millions , the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line .
in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls , they are keen to be the top iptv dogs .
software giant microsoft thinks iptv - internet protocol tv - is the future of television , and it sits neatly with its vision of the " connected entertainment experience " .
" telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time , " ed graczyk , director of marketing for microsoft iptv , told the bbc news website .
" the challenge has been the broadband network , and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution .
" compression technology was not efficient enough , the net was not good enough .
a lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality . "
the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv , to the mobile , to the gaming console and so on ed graczyk , microsoft iptv q & a : internet protocol tv last year , he said , was all about deal making and partnering up ; shaping the " iptv ecosystem " .
this year , those deals will start to play out and more services will come online .
" 2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america , and other parts of asia , it will expand , " he added .
what telcos really want to do is to send the " triple-play " of video , voice , and data down one single line , be it cable or dsl -lrb- digital subscriber line -rrb- .
some are talking about " quadruple play " , too , with mobile services added into the mix .
it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators .
according to technology analysts , tdg research , there will be 20 million subscribers to iptv services in under six years .
way of the future key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data , whenever a viewer wants it , is that it uses the same technology as the internet .
it means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the " broadcaster " .
this allows for more dvd-like interactivity , limitless storage and broadcast space , bespoke channel " playlists " , and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer 's fingertips .
it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller , niche or localised audiences , sending films to bollywood fans for instance , as well as individual devices .
microsoft 's iptv software helps telcos manage iptv operators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer , bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver .
perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking .
currently , there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite , cable or freeview .
with iptv , the speed is 15 milliseconds .
" that gets rounds of applause , " according to mr graczyk .
microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago .
" we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future - but that is several years away , " said mr graczyk .
" as with music , tv has moved to digital formats .
" the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv , to the mobile , to the gaming console and so on . "
the company intends its microsoft 's iptv edition software , an end-to-end management and delivery platform , to let telcos to do exactly that , seamlessly .
it has netted seven major telcos as customers , representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers .
its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date , said mr graczyk .
smaller outfits iptv is about more than telcos , though .
there are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net 's power .
jeremy allaire , chief of brightcove , told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a " channel " .
the line you get the net through will also deliver tv and voice calls " it is not just niches , but about exploiting content not usually viewed , " he said .
" we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content , and who often see unencumbered distribution .
" for them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive , " he said .
this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they can not offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives , for instance .
what is a clear sign that iptv has a future is that microsoft is not the only player in the field .

but any early attempts to do it - the uk 's home choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network .
now that broadband networks are bedding down , and it is becoming essential for millions , the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line .
in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls , they are keen to be the top iptv dogs .
software giant microsoft thinks iptv - internet protocol tv - is the future of television , and it sits neatly with its vision of the " connected entertainment experience " .
" telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time , " ed graczyk , director of marketing for microsoft iptv , told the bbc news website .
" the challenge has been the broadband network , and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution .
" compression technology was not efficient enough , the net was not good enough .
a lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality . "
the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv , to the mobile , to the gaming console and so on ed graczyk , microsoft iptv q & a : internet protocol tv last year , he said , was all about deal making and partnering up ; shaping the " iptv ecosystem " .
this year , those deals will start to play out and more services will come online .
" 2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america , and other parts of asia , it will expand , " he added .
what telcos really want to do is to send the " triple-play " of video , voice , and data down one single line , be it cable or dsl -lrb- digital subscriber line -rrb- .
some are talking about " quadruple play " , too , with mobile services added into the mix .
it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators .
according to technology analysts , tdg research , there will be 20 million subscribers to iptv services in under six years .
way of the future key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data , whenever a viewer wants it , is that it uses the same technology as the internet .
it means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the " broadcaster " .
this allows for more dvd-like interactivity , limitless storage and broadcast space , bespoke channel " playlists " , and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer 's fingertips .
it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller , niche or localised audiences , sending films to bollywood fans for instance , as well as individual devices .
microsoft 's iptv software helps telcos manage iptv operators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer , bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver .
perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking .
currently , there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite , cable or freeview .
with iptv , the speed is 15 milliseconds .
" that gets rounds of applause , " according to mr graczyk .
microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago .
" we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future - but that is several years away , " said mr graczyk .
" as with music , tv has moved to digital formats .
" the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv , to the mobile , to the gaming console and so on . "
the company intends its microsoft 's iptv edition software , an end-to-end management and delivery platform , to let telcos to do exactly that , seamlessly .
it has netted seven major telcos as customers , representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers .
its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date , said mr graczyk .
smaller outfits iptv is about more than telcos , though .
there are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net 's power .
jeremy allaire , chief of brightcove , told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a " channel " .
the line you get the net through will also deliver tv and voice calls " it is not just niches , but about exploiting content not usually viewed , " he said .
" we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content , and who often see unencumbered distribution .
" for them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive , " he said .
this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they can not offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives , for instance .
what is a clear sign that iptv has a future is that microsoft is not the only player in the field .
there are a lot of other " middleware " players providing similar management services as microsoft , like myrio and c-cor .
but it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful .

but any early attempts to do it - the uk 's home choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network .
now that broadband networks are bedding down , and it is becoming essential for millions , the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line .
in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls , they are keen to be the top iptv dogs .
software giant microsoft thinks iptv - internet protocol tv - is the future of television , and it sits neatly with its vision of the " connected entertainment experience " .
" telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time , " ed graczyk , director of marketing for microsoft iptv , told the bbc news website .
" the challenge has been the broadband network , and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution .
" compression technology was not efficient enough , the net was not good enough .
a lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality . "
the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv , to the mobile , to the gaming console and so on ed graczyk , microsoft iptv q & a : internet protocol tv last year , he said , was all about deal making and partnering up ; shaping the " iptv ecosystem " .
this year , those deals will start to play out and more services will come online .
" 2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america , and other parts of asia , it will expand , " he added .
what telcos really want to do is to send the " triple-play " of video , voice , and data down one single line , be it cable or dsl -lrb- digital subscriber line -rrb- .
some are talking about " quadruple play " , too , with mobile services added into the mix .
it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators .
according to technology analysts , tdg research , there will be 20 million subscribers to iptv services in under six years .
way of the future key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data , whenever a viewer wants it , is that it uses the same technology as the internet .
it means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the " broadcaster " .
this allows for more dvd-like interactivity , limitless storage and broadcast space , bespoke channel " playlists " , and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer 's fingertips .
it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller , niche or localised audiences , sending films to bollywood fans for instance , as well as individual devices .
microsoft 's iptv software helps telcos manage iptv operators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer , bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver .
perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking .
currently , there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite , cable or freeview .
with iptv , the speed is 15 milliseconds .
" that gets rounds of applause , " according to mr graczyk .
microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago .
" we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future - but that is several years away , " said mr graczyk .
" as with music , tv has moved to digital formats .
" the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv , to the mobile , to the gaming console and so on . "
the company intends its microsoft 's iptv edition software , an end-to-end management and delivery platform , to let telcos to do exactly that , seamlessly .
it has netted seven major telcos as customers , representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers .
its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date , said mr graczyk .
smaller outfits iptv is about more than telcos , though .
there are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net 's power .
jeremy allaire , chief of brightcove , told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a " channel " .
the line you get the net through will also deliver tv and voice calls " it is not just niches , but about exploiting content not usually viewed , " he said .
" we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content , and who often see unencumbered distribution .
" for them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive , " he said .
this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they can not offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives , for instance .

" we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content , and who often see unencumbered distribution .
" for them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive , " he said .
this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they can not offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives , for instance .
what is a clear sign that iptv has a future is that microsoft is not the only player in the field .
there are a lot of other " middleware " players providing similar management services as microsoft , like myrio and c-cor .
but it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- tv 's future down the phone line bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 14 march 2005 , 08:07 gmt tv 's future down the phone line by jo twist bbc news science and technology reporter internet tv has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now .
but any early attempts to do it - the uk 's home choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network .
now that broadband networks are bedding down , and it is becoming essential for millions , the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line .
in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls , they are keen to be the top iptv dogs .
software giant microsoft thinks iptv - internet protocol tv - is the future of television , and it sits neatly with its vision of the " connected entertainment experience " .
" telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time , " ed graczyk , director of marketing for microsoft iptv , told the bbc news website .
" the challenge has been the broadband network , and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution .
" compression technology was not efficient enough , the net was not good enough .
a lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality . "
" the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv , to the mobile , to the gaming console and so on " ed graczyk , microsoft iptv q & a : internet protocol tv last year , he said , was all about deal making and partnering up ; shaping the " iptv ecosystem " .
this year , those deals will start to play out and more services will come online .
" 2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america , and other parts of asia , it will expand , " he added .
what telcos really want to do is to send the " triple-play " of video , voice , and data down one single line , be it cable or dsl -lrb- digital subscriber line -rrb- .
some are talking about " quadruple play " , too , with mobile services added into the mix .
it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators .
according to technology analysts , tdg research , there will be 20 million subscribers to iptv services in under six years .
way of the future key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data , whenever a viewer wants it , is that it uses the same technology as the internet .
it means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the " broadcaster " .
this allows for more dvd-like interactivity , limitless storage and broadcast space , bespoke channel " playlists " , and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer 's fingertips .
it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller , niche or localised audiences , sending films to bollywood fans for instance , as well as individual devices .
operators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer , bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver .
perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking .
currently , there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite , cable or freeview .
with iptv , the speed is 15 milliseconds .
" that gets rounds of applause , " according to mr graczyk .
microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago .
" we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future - but that is several years away , " said mr graczyk .
" as with music , tv has moved to digital formats .
" the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv , to the mobile , to the gaming console and so on . "
the company intends its microsoft 's iptv edition software , an end-to-end management and delivery platform , to let telcos to do exactly that , seamlessly .
it has netted seven major telcos as customers , representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers .
its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date , said mr graczyk .
smaller outfits iptv is about more than telcos , though .
there are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net 's power .
jeremy allaire , chief of brightcove , told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a " channel " .
" it is not just niches , but about exploiting content not usually viewed , " he said .
" we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content , and who often see unencumbered distribution .
" for them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive , " he said .

the apple ipod took this trend of thinking in new ways about the media we own into the mainstream and it has been continued with the growing numbers of players that let you take your music , movies and pictures around with you .
but portability is not just about putting your collection in your pocket .
it has more to do with realising the worth of that collection and trying to get more out of it .
" you only have to download 100 songs or so to have your music collection be more valuable than the hard drive its sitting on , " said drew henry , general manager of nvidia 's desktop division .
increasingly , said mr henry , consumers want to be able to enjoy their valuable collections where-ever they are in the home .
" it 's quite clear that this digital distribution of music , video and images is going to be the way to that media gets distributed in the future , " he said .
sound story the ipod got people thinking about what to do with digital media the preferred path for that distribution is wireless - which is becoming as popular in home networks as digital music players are on the streets .
most of the devices that act as media servers being shown off at cebit use wireless in one way or another to get those songs or films spread about your home .
at the moment the dominant theme is moving music around , not least because lower speed wi-fi networks could struggle to stream high-quality video .
however , many of the music servers detailed below will handle video too .
at cebit the 80gb mp3beamer audio server got an airing and the standalone machine acts as a central repository of your music which you can then beam to different devices round the home .
once you 've got the mp3beamer though you will need to buy other devices that connect to your stereo to decode the datastream and turn the bits back into sounds .
plug in the netgear mp101 does a similar job to the mp3beamer but usefully has a small four-line display on the front that lets you see which playlist or tracks are about to come up .
other hard disk music players include the slim devices squeezebox 2 - that plugs in to your stereo to route the music you have on your pc to other rooms - and the montego ma-1120 wireless media adaptor .
cebit is a hi-tech and hardware heaven linksys showed off its wireless-g media link box that can store and stream video as well as music and is ready for the net-based entertainment services expected soon .
one thing to watch out for is the problems that digitally locked music from online sites such as napster and itunes presents .
the digital locks on downloaded tracks can stop them being streamed to other devices in your home .
you can only be sure that tracks ripped from cds will play anywhere .
restrictions on what you can do with the music you own might also limit the number of rooms that you can play it in .
the relatively low data rates of the more widely used wi-fi standards might make it a choppy experience too .
if you want a slightly different way to spread that sound around the home , you could look at the st & t powerline mp3 streamer that uses the electricity cables in your home as its distribution route .
a central box sends music out to receivers plugged in to the power sockets to spread the sounds around .

" there are incidents , like parmalat , where we did in our view nothing wrong , and we do n't want to become an easy target for folks looking to get money out of the company .
that one we are going to fight tooth and nail . "
so where did it all go wrong ?
remember the 1980s , the decade of booming stock markets , yuppies and shoulder pads ?
in many ways the era was encapsulated in the film wall street , in which michael douglas played the crooked financier gordon gecko , who infamously declared " greed is good " .
according to one commentator , amey stone , the problems emerging at citigroup now , are born out of this culture .
' aggressive style ' citigroup was created from a series of mergers and acquisitions , and the pressure to make these deals work financially was high .
tough profit targets were set and executives could earn big bonuses .
ms stone , a journalist with the financial magazine business week , co-authored a book on former chief executive sanford weill , the man responsible for creating the citigroup of today .
" -lsb- mr weill -rsb- was very hands on and a very controlling manager who oversaw a lot of operations , " she says .
" he did have an aggressive style , he emphasised profits , he was very strict about divisions delivering profit goals .
i think questions of ethics really took a back seat . "
all change ?
but changing the mindset from maximising short term profits to considering the group 's long term reputation is now a key management priority , says citigroup 's current chief executive , charles prince .
the banking industry is one where reputation is everything , and recent scandals will not have helped citigroup .
only a few weeks ago mr prince announced a new series of initiatives .
an ethics hotline is to be set up for employees and their pay may be linked to the long term health of the group .
but can this more ethical move really change an organisation 's inbuilt culture ?
ms krawcheck thinks so .
" i can tell you that this management team , led by ' chuck ' prince , has made it its number one priority to be the most successful financial services firm in the world .
" we 're taking numerous actions - including compensation and reviews - all the things that get to the culture of an organisation , to make sure we have a culture of the highest ethics . "

the reclaiming of the large island off the country 's south-eastern coast has been a central creed of the communist party ever since it fought its way to power in 1949 , driving its nationalist opponents to seek refuge there .
almost every other policy has since been turned on its head .
but the threat to use force to win back china 's " renegade province " remains .
an attack on a prosperous democracy of 23 million people would hardly tally with the communist mainland 's plan for a " peaceful rise " to great power status .
indeed , it would undermine all that 's been achieved in recent years in terms of national development and global acceptance , say observers .
yet ask any chinese if it is a sacrifice worth making and you get the same answer .
" after all the humiliations of the past , it is time for china to stand up again in the world , " said liang yan , a beijing office-worker .
" we must realise this dream of being reunited . "
stomachs first ?
many on taiwan - chiefly those from the mainland - share the dream of one china , even if they do not want to live under communist rule .
chen 's reform plans president chen wants a new constitution by 2008 aims to modernise political institutions , increase efficiency , enshrine human rights and review role of national assembly china says plan is the ' biggest threat to peace and stability across the taiwan strait ' but mr chen insists the changes will not touch sovereignty issues taiwan 's government still calls itself the republic of china .
but in recent years the taiwanese majority have elected leaders committed to constitutional change that would formalise the island 's separate identity .
president chen shui-bian wants a new constitution by 2008 .
that , says beijing , could force it to attack .
" about 50 % of the population want independence - especially the young , who hope that one day they 'll be free , " said tony chang , a taiwan-based businessman whose company has factories on the mainland .
but he believes taiwan 's growing economic reliance on china will stop the constitutional changes from going ahead .
" we chinese always believe first in our stomachs , " he said .
formal political talks may be frozen , but there has been a huge growth in other contacts .
more than a million people from taiwan now live on the mainland and taiwan is china 's biggest single investor .
direct charter flights were launched this year , raising hopes for permanent air links .
business leaders from taiwan meet beijing 's top leaders on a regular basis , according to james lilley , a former us envoy to both taiwan and china .
" the businessmen want security guarantees for their contracts ... and i guess they get them , " he said .
" but that does n't mean we can all breathe more easily , " he added , pointing to china 's rapid arms build-up .
keeping vague the cia has warned that the military balance is shifting away from taiwan - a trend that will be accelerated , says the us , if the eu goes ahead with lifting its embargo on arms sales to china .
i see no solution , given that both sides insist on their positions andrew yang analyst according to mr lilley , china 's military muscle-flexing is part real and part chinese opera .
" with all the gong-bashing and missile-testing , no one has died in the taiwan strait since 1958 .
but we 've got to be prepared , " he adds , " to make the cost of war so high it becomes a lousy game for them . "
the us is committed to helping taiwan if it comes under attack but has remained deliberately vague about how far this help would go .
china chooses to be equally ambiguous about the exact point at which taiwan 's moves towards independence would goad it into action .
its current policy comprises three main strands , according to jin canrong of the people 's university of china .
one is to rely on american and other international pressure on taiwan .
another is for china to try to " win the hearts and minds of taiwanese " through flights , favourable tariffs and other means .
but the problem could not be solved through economic integration alone , said mr jin .
he made it clear that the most important element in beijing 's strategy remained the threat of force .
" china will speed up military modernisation to make deterrence more credible , " he said .
the army and other hardline factions could easily push more moderate leaders into a corner on something as important as taiwan , say foreign observers .
the army has a vested interest in keeping the issue alive , since it is the taiwan issue that justifies its claims on the budget , according to michael yahuda , a british specialist now based in the united states .
but the party leadership has only itself to blame , he said .
" raising unrealistic expectations of unification has roused nationalist feelings to such an extent that when people see their leaders ca n't get their way on taiwan they could turn against them . "
olympic pressure on monday , china passed a new measure called the anti-secession law , which is seen as a way for beijing to stop taiwan from formally declaring independence .
taiwan 's president may not in fact secure constitutional changes " the new law is not helpful .
it merely creates more tension , rather than making either side more ready to return to the negotiating table , " said jean-pierre cabestan of the french research centre on contemporary china .
traditionally , chinese leaders take a hard line on taiwan .
but some analysts have speculated that now mr hu has consolidated his power , he may risk trying out the more flexible policies now being aired by some chinese academics .
these include moves to allow taiwan more scope for having its own international identity .
in the diplomatically sensitive run-up to the beijing olympics , china does not want a show-down on taiwan any time soon .
but andrew yang , a leading strategist in taiwan who makes regular visits to china , is pessimistic .
he believes the trend towards separatism and independence in taiwan is irreversible , and predicts no change in china 's fundamental determination to defend what it sees as its territorial integrity .
" i see no solution , given that both sides insist on their positions , " he said .
" if taiwan continues to push for independence ... china 's leaders will have no options but to consider extreme measures .
and their final option is to use force . "

he believes the trend towards separatism and independence in taiwan is irreversible , and predicts no change in china 's fundamental determination to defend what it sees as its territorial integrity .
" i see no solution , given that both sides insist on their positions , " he said .
" if taiwan continues to push for independence ... china 's leaders will have no options but to consider extreme measures .
and their final option is to use force . "

current rules allowing procedures , for medical reasons , until the 24th week of pregnancy are " tantamount to abortion on demand " , he told cosmopolitan .
tony blair said there were no plans to change the law but " debate would continue " on the " difficult issue " .
the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later .
free vote more than 180,000 women in england and wales had terminations last year , of which fewer than 1 % were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks .
you should not criminalise a woman who , in very difficult circumstances , makes that choice tony blair in the cosmopolitan interview , reported in the observer , mr howard said : " i believe abortion should be available to everyone , but the law should be changed .
" in the past i voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and i would be prepared to go down to 20 . "
all three main parties offer a free vote on abortion and mr howard stressed this was his personal view .
shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue .
difficult issue tony blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews , conducted as part of the magazine 's " high heeled vote " campaign .
mr blair said it was a " difficult issue " .
" however , much i dislike the idea of abortion , you should not criminalise a woman who , in very difficult circumstances , makes that choice .
" obviously there is a time beyond which you ca n't have an abortion , and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue . "
late abortions mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean " i do n't know what i would do now " .
anne weyman , chief executive of the family planning association , said : " young women make up a high percentage of late abortions : they often just do n't come forward .
" they hope its not true , or might have irregular periods if they are young , so they may not be sure they are pregnant .
" there are also issues around older women who are peri-menopausal and may think there 's no chance they are going to be pregnant . "
she added : " what is the benefit to women , or to the potential child , of forcing a woman to have a baby ? "
anti-abortion group the pro-life alliance " congratulated " mr howard on his new stance , but said it did not go far enough .

the 53-year-old , better known for his best-selling travelogues and books on the english language , won the prestigious 2004 aventis prize for science writing , which he described as an exploration of the topic for those who found school lessons " boring and mystifying " .
" i do n't plan to write another science book , " says the softly-spoken writer , " but i do n't plan not to .
i do enjoy writing histories , and taking subjects that are generally dull and trying to make them interesting . "
in the case of a short history of nearly everything , bryson made a point of focusing on the lives of the scientists he was writing about , instead of the more technical details , in order to make it more interesting to the reader .
adorably quirky " most scientists are without exception adorably quirky , and one of the ways of making it more accessible was to try to get readers interested in the person , " he says .
" if the reader has warmed to them then they can be more receptive to the science itself . "
i enjoy taking subjects that are generally dull and trying to make them interesting bill bryson bryson was thrilled when the book was well-received by scientists and , naturally , the prize was an added bonus .
" it was fantastic , the nicest compliment i 've ever been paid , " he says .
" i knew nothing about science when i went into it . "
whether or not he returns to the subject , interest in a short history shows no sign of waning .
as well as being a judge on the panel for the 2005 aventis prize , bryson gave a talk at london 's royal society last week on aspects of the book - as well as announcing the long list for this year 's prize .
natural history he is also working on a number of other projects , including an autobiographical book about growing up in 1950s america and a biography of william shakespeare .
" that 's very enjoyable , " he says .
" i have n't done a biography before and it 's interesting to try to understand the life of another human being . "
bryson 's biggest success , however , has been as a travel writer , with a string of best-sellers including down under , which saw him visiting australia , notes from a small island - in which he travels across britain - and a walk in the woods , in which he follows the appalachian trail .
bryson attended a buckingham palace reception in 2004 he admits he would like to return to travel writing in the future - with possible candidates including japan and the far east - but is in no doubt as to the best place he has visited so far on his travels .
" the most enjoyable overall i think was australia ; i really fell in love with it , " he says .
" i like it a lot , i think it 's a terrific country ; they really know how to live .
the natural history of the place is endlessly fascinating . "
bryson admits , however , that his tendency to write in the first person - injecting his personality into his books and regularly introducing his wife cynthia and their four children into the action - has been known to backfire .
" i had a letter from a man not too long ago who said he enjoyed my books and he wanted to get to know me better - so he suggested a house swap , " he says .
" and he was quite serious !
" you get a lot of very odd things , and if you write like i do in the first person people do sometimes misinterpret that .
they think that we 're friends already . "

this year 's theme was " big hair and beyond " and it was also the twentieth anniversary of the charity which aims to tackle poverty and social injustice in the uk and africa .
comedians peter kay , dawn french , ricky gervais , lenny henry , ruby wax and liza tarbuck were among the stars who appeared on friday 's tv show on bbc 1 .
singers sir elton john , george michael and robbie williams also featured in little britain sketches broadcast during the seven-hour telethon .

your comments : " i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " " sass , somerset the school where i work has organised a strictly come dancing contest where the children are teaching teams of staff to perform dance routines and then children pay to vote for the winners .
i spent comic relief night in front of the telly , wildly fluctuating between laughter and tears watching the film cameos from africa - it makes you realise what a rich life we all are privileged to live here , when it takes so little to make others in desperate need so happy .
i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " - such a happy song and a simple but effective video .
hope it gets to number one !
i 'm happy to give time and money to causes like this , long may it continue .
sass , somerset well i spent the night working on the donation line - having been semi dragged into helping by a friend of mine .
i was incredibly glad she did do so - we only meant to stay till 10pm , but were still going when our call centre ran out of forms at 1.30am.
it was a brilliant and humbling experience .
people donated what they could from a few pounds to a thousand plus and the atmosphere was great .
completely different from my day job , but my way of helping comic relief - i could donate little so was glad to help where i could .
roz , bradford , uk we sponsored our good mate emma to dress as barbie for a full day of college .
she raised over £ 120 - well done girly : d becca , birmingham just donated - if i have to go without a few pints because a day which reminds us all how lucky we are and how unfortunate some are asks me to then that 's fine .
we all have a responsibility since it is in no small part the imposition of a particular western brand of economic capitalism on many nations which has left them playing catch-up .
evan , edinburgh " people giving what they could afford " stuart , cleethorpes , uk i was on the donation line last night and was completely humbled by all those who pledged , from a few pounds to a few hundred .
the amount did n't matter , it was people giving what they could afford .
to all those humbugs out there , i 'm sorry you will never know the pleasure of speaking to every single fantastic person who phoned us last night .
stuart , cleethorpes , uk two 6 year olds from west derby liverpool , rosa and scarlett made and sold red nose cakes and raised £ 40 for red nose day .
it was very cold and windy but we did n't mind because we wanted to care for the children in africa .
rosa harrison , liverpool , uk balmoral ward at southend hospital have raised £ 306 for comic relief .
thanks to all staff and patients who gave so generously .
nicky stone , southend , uk third thorley brownies became " red " ies for a day and raised 10 pounds by dressing in red and playing fun games .
everyone brought bronze coins and made a big red nose day face with them .
rita eustace , bishop 's stortford , uk " photos were taken of people with funny hair dos " simon chan , taunton , somerset our college council organised a rnd hair do competition where photos were taken of people with funny hair dos , and prizes were provided by local companies .
i personally did the donations , and donations from the council alone accumulated to at least £ 120 .
the leaf division sold red noses , and it was lots of fun .
i had my hair dyed red and i wore a suit .
simon chan , taunton , somerset staff and children of little rainbows day nursery wore wigs , red noses and dressed in colours of the rainbow .
the children have been busy making and selling badges , selling the red noses , staff and parents having a go on the official sweepstake and finally bringing into nursery lots of pennies to make a " mile of pennies " .
in total we raised £ 191.33 sandra wheeler , barrow-in-furness , cumbria , england it 's 3am and we 've just got in from " work " !
the contact centre where we work for jobcentre plus , was open to take pledges from 7pm until 2am taking in excess of £ 150,000 .
it was a great evening and a pleasure to be involved in such a good cause .
congratulations to all the organisers , you did a fantastic job !
helen and iain , telford , shropshire i dressed as elvis and sang loudly at the unsuspecting public in bath , making over 500 pounds over the day !
me and many other members of university rags raised tens of thousands in street collections and silly stunts across the country .
huseyin , bath , uk ca n't believe some people on here are moaning about red nose day ...
my kids were up early this morning for red hair colour and no uniform at school .
great stuff .
raising money for charity and a bit of fun as well .
long may it continue .
john , london , uk " i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair " jon murtagh , lincoln i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair .
he did n't look best pleased , but had to grin and bear it , whilst handing over a £ 1 to the swear box .
jon murtagh , lincoln , uk in my office we are having office e-mail bingo , a football tournament , a team quiz , office olympics and numerous other fundraising events in addition to dressing up .
it 's one day of the year when raising money for charity also really raises a smile -lrb- even a giggle at the sight of your colleagues in a red wig , t-shirt and nose -rrb- .
rowan , livingston , scotland i work for royal mail and they are allowing me to dress up as elvis , -lrb- white cat suit , wig , glasses , etc -rrb- .
i will be delivering the mail on a stretch of chiswick high road .
vinny o 'connor , chiswick , london w4 after my shift at work i will be joining many colleagues from the call centre i work at in durham .
we will be taking the pledges from viewers of comic relief - we are all volunteering until 2am so dig deep ! ! !
julie , tyne & wear " i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues " dominique guyot , bristol , uk i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues .
a qualified hairdresser has agreed to come and do it .
i 've managed to raise £ 300 in sponsorship money from friends and colleagues .
i do n't normally wear my hair short , let alone none at all !
dominique guyot , bristol , uk red nose day is a fantastic day !
it puts all problems into perspective , when you see the courage and bravery of people who go through so much with so little .
i do not understand how people can not donate to such a deserving cause .
naomi sharman , leeds most people at our work are not bothering to participate in our dressing up day but there 's a few red-haired people with their clothes on back to front , one person in pyjamas and a few red noses around .
david hilton , hudds , uk when i hear some of the comments on these pages , i feel ashamed to be british -lrb- and i 'm a very patriotic person -rrb- .
i 've just donated £ 100 on your behalf to make up for the moaning .
davu , buck i will be doing absolutely nothing , and refusing to pay for our dress-down day at work .
i will decide when i am going to donate to charity , and no-one is going to get money out of me any other way .
in fact , events like red nose day just force me to tighten the purse strings even more !
andy , leeds , uk " my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day " ian child , orpington , kent i have just finished reading the comments on this website and ca n't believe that there are people in this country that do n't care or are just not interested .
my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day .
ian child , orpington , kent all my work colleagues are dressed in red , buying wonderful home-made cakes , contributing financially .
in a very busy environment people are much more smiley and relaxed .
it does wonders for team working too !
jan , brighton as it 's red nose day i 've taken the day off work , as i do every red nose or children in need day .
why ?
because i refuse to pay £ 1 for a piddly slice of cake and being made to feel guilty if i do n't buy a piece .
red nose day is lame ...
it 's cringe worthy and embarrassing .
gemma , surrey " we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time . "
anon , london i work in a large london office , there is no indication whatsoever that this is red nose day .
nothing is red , nobody has dressed up , there are no special cakes and no collection box of any kind .
it 's not because anyone has banned it , it 's never been mentioned .
we 're all too busy doing our work ...
we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london , england nothing .
i fear that every time the nation gives to charity mr brown takes note , then he knows how much he can squeeze out of us with stealth taxes .
robert , london , uk i can not believe the attitude of most of the people on here !
i agree that we need to think long term about poverty , which is why i give so much a month to christian aid .
but most people do n't give regularly .
comic relief raises millions every year , of course that does some good !
caroline , oldham " after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness " catherine o , maidenhead , uk if these comments really do reflect the balance of public opinion , they paint a pretty depressing picture of british attitudes .
like many people , i make regular donations to good causes and do n't usually give to tv appeals but after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness .
catherine o , maidenhead , uk our school is very charity minded , we have kids and staff in all red , male staff in drag , sponsored walkers , dancers and silences ... you name it !
it 's a festival for a good cause !
vicki , london here in the cosmetics team at boots hq , the fellas in the team have agreed to a ' make-over ' if us girls raise £ 100 -lrb- well on our way -rrb- .
lipsticks , blush and nail polish at the ready !
lisa , notts , england well i 'm sitting typing this at work in my pyjamas .
i am the charity co-ordinator at my work and we always get so much from our colleagues !
i think that if we have things and other people do n't then we should help them out .
red nose day does n't come every year , so give as much as you can that 's what i say .
sara , aberdeen , scotland we have gone mad at work this year .
while most of us ca n't get away with wearing daft costumes , we are wearing red , but there are some cross-dressers kicking about , a bake-off , mad hair , mad clothes and everyone is giving their hard earned money with a really big smile on their faces .
even the " boring " ones have been persuaded to join in !
long live red nose day !
claire , chesterfield , uk " we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour " benedict taylor , long eaton , uk at trent college in long eaton my boarding house are doing a sponsored hymnathon .
we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour .
so far it looks as though we get around £ 250 for comic relief .
benedict taylor , long eaton , uk ignoring it .
this charity fest supports causes that are , in my opinion , not worthy target your giving and make sure it goes where its needed .
freddy , uk how can these people who claim to be ' charited out ' sleep at night ?
i believe if you can not put your hands in your pockets a couple of times a year in order to give to people less fortunate than your selves , then you live in a very cynical and selfish world .
most of us in the uk are privileged to lead comfortable lives , if you can not be bothered to support those who have the tenacity and courage to say " no this is not right , we can do something to help these people " then shame on you .
danny - yorkshire , goole uk i have baked some red nose biscuits , and am selling them for a minimum of 20p each , but hoping that people will donate more .
gina saunders , oxford , uk i 'm doing " sponsor a pigtail " at work !
for every donation of 50p i get from a colleague , i put an extra pigtail in my hair .
unfortunately it 's going down so well that my arms are aching , but it 's worth it to fill my little collecting box .
sarah b , york , uk i give by direct debit to 3 smaller charities every month -lrb- for the last 5 years -rrb- so i am no scrooge .
however , i find my self unimpressed and unmoved by the emotional blackmail tactics used on tv .
i also deplore the idealistic ' making poverty history ' claims -lrb- it ai n't gonna happen far to pie in the sky ! -rrb-
i will not watch the ego fest that is comic relief ; i am tired of seeing talent less publicity seeking so called ' celebs ' embarrassing attempts to " entertain " .
if they really cared , they just donate and save us the embarrassment .
i would rather give my hard earned cash to help charities of my choice in this country .
meg , grantham lincs sorry , has victor meldrew hijacked this forum as a fundraising gag ? - that 's the impression i 'm getting from all the whingeing and self-righteous comments on here !
but no , unfortunately the comments are genuine , and very disappointing .
i for one will be donating tonight and enjoying the entertainment , which hopefully will restore my faith .
long live comic relief !
mary , gloucester , uk " we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day " elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day -lrb- with red sauce -rrb- , we are wearing something red and for the afternoon we have strawberries and cream , mmmm .
the diet starts monday , after all it 's for charity !
elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk in our fish and chip shop we 've all contributed in wearing the red nose day t-shirts , spraying our hair red and going wild on the make up .
we all look so funny away from the boring uniform we all usually wear .
maria , kidderminster , uk the staff at british gas in leeds are taking phone pledges this evening until midnight .
stacey kerrigan , leeds , uk sprayed my three children 's ' hair red , spiked my hair and sprayed it red , bought them a red nose each , put money in the bucket at my sons school , think i 've done my bit for comic relief .
al , milton keynes , uk our college -lrb- sfx college , clapham -rrb- are doing a variety of events -lrb- which have been happening this week -rrb- held by our student council , this includes dressing up in your old school uniform , competitions and selling fair trade products , including drinks and food , they will also be selling the white wrists bands to promote making poverty history .
our college is hoping that we as a college community will raise lots of money for a great cause !
mel , london " i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to . "
alison , dundee we are having a raffle with donated gifts -lrb- mostly alcohol ! -rrb- from staff , we have the red nose scratch and match and are selling cakes , etc which people kindly brought in .
we also have staff with red hair and one with not so much hair , so big red dots on his head !
i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we raised £ 250 last week holding a cake sale in the biological sciences department at the university of liverpool .
everyone was so generous , with some people paying up to £ 10 for 1 cake !
the microbiology department , liverpool , uk after a hectic morning of red hair dyes , face paint and frantic scrabbling for red clothes - i 've taken the children to school -lrb- non-uniform day , with lots of stalls to raise more money -rrb- , with a pocket full of change each and will now spend the day cleaning the house , so that tonight i can settle down with the family and watch some entertainment on tv !
i will probably end up crying my eyes out - and donating more money than i can afford - but hey !
that 's what comic relief is all about !
jb , essex i 'm going to my uni lectures dressed as a giant bumblebee iona knight , exeter , devon it 's all very well to say that you give to a charity of your choice but the fact is that an event like red nose day mobilizes a lot of people to actually do something to raise cash and also awareness .
people can raise a lot of money at planned events and along with the noses , car accessories , stickers , ring tones , etc a huge amount is generated for the charities in question .
i 'm not really the sort of person who would put myself out there doing something " wacky " either but i can see why it 's a good thing that a lot of people do and i certainly would n't begrudge them my cash .
ann , scotland " message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work " liz wood , reading all the kids in our primary school brought £ 1 in today for the privilege of dressing up and having red hair .
they are also doing a talent show this afternoon .
my daughter bryony and her friend conor are doing a sponsored silence tomorrow .
all the proceeds will go to red nose day .
all great fun ways to raise money for a great cause .
message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work !
nyree dick , coaltown of balgonie , fife dressed up as fairy .
liz wood , reading i think the red noses are brilliant , but the sheer amount of tv coverage is rather ott in my opinion .
my place of work is n't doing anything for comic relief .
i work in the reception so have stuck my red nose on top of my monitor to brighten things up .
it was my birthday yesterday so tonight i shall be celebrating that by going out for a meal with friends .
helen , southampton , uk what will i be doing ?
looking for a red nose !
why on earth only restrict selling them to sainsbury and oxfam - then allow them to sell out in south wales ?
why not treat them like poppies and sell everywhere ?
okay - rant over - but if it was n't for the good will of an old friend , my 6-year-old lad would have felt very left out in school today - as others no doubt will .
please fix it next year .
tony , wales well i beeped my horn at aled from the chris moyles red nose rally this morning in plymouth .

stu maddison , west london as someone who 's been involved in charity fundraising and voluntary work for years i 've read the other comments with a mixture of horror and anger .
let 's just remember that the key thing about charitably fundraising is that you give freely and willingly .
there 's no " feel guilty " about most of the collectors out there .
they 're doing something positive and you 're just being asked to support that .
as for the " self-serving actor " rubbish .
do me a favour wake up to yourselves .
sure there are a couple like that but the majority do it because they 're in a position to do something positive .
i 've seen that commitment up close and personal .

leanne , cornwall " it 's a real good fun atmosphere " hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset i work for the local government and all 900 people in the building have been giving me money for comic relief .
it 's a real good fun atmosphere in here today and i reckon we will break £ 1000 by next week ! !
hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset we are donating the fares from one tram to comic relief - which could be up to £ 5,000 !
the chosen tram will be decorated with posters highlighting it as the ' red nose day tram ' .
nottingham 's trams , nottingham , uk the staff at highways agency office in birmingham are seeing red and losing their heads ! !
several sponsored events include dressing as a clown , shaving half of a beard off and having a very dodgy red mullet-do ! !
also tea and cake sales have been arranged for this lunchtime and most people are wearing red items of clothing and donating a £ 1 to support comic relief .
laura , birmingham we here at bt parkside in coventry are preparing to man some of the donation lines for tonight 's pledges ... wish us luck .
sarah 's team , coventry , uk at 11 o 'clock on friday 11th we just waxed 11 legs from 6 volunteers .
they were all men and screamed like babies .
sarah lewendon , basingstoke " a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard " dave love , kesgrave , england a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard - and he looks a bit like a lady !
he looks great sitting in an open plan office .
dave love , kesgrave , england i shall be watching it and lending it my moral support .
i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i think it 's more important that people take the opportunity to contribute regularly to a charity or two throughout the year rather than give sporadically .
set up a direct debit to a charity for as little as a couple of pounds a month and everyone wins .
you feel good , the charity gets the money it needs .
the only drawback is that there would be no need for shows like tonight 's comic relief !
mo c , uk today we 're holding a raffle with prizes donated by the bosses ; dressing down in denim and red -lrb- quite brave for a solicitors ' office ! -rrb- and having an auction for a fast boat trip .
we 'll probably only raise about £ 300 but every penny helps .
bearing in mind that people have given generously to the tsunami appeal , we 'll be happy about any amount we raise .
sue , southampton , uk to those who rattle their tins and dress in ridiculous costumes and try to make me feel guilty for not joining in the " fun " : you 've no idea whether i give up my evenings and weekends to work in a homeless shelter ; you do n't know that i 'm not an activist for amnesty international ; you have n't a clue what charities i support with tax-efficient , gift-aided standing orders .
this may be one day for you , but please do n't judge everyone by your standards and assume the stony-faced people who are avoiding you are uncharitable .
some of them are just fed up with the patronising and accusing judgements .
anon i was on a tall ships youth trust square rig sailing ship -lrb- stavros s niarchos -rrb- in the canaries last week and i climbed to the top of the 45 metre mast to raise money for comic relief .
i have raised over £ 750 so far from sponsors where i work - boden - and from fellow crew members on the ship .
pete lemon , great hampden , uk i am being sponsored to be silent in the office all day !
it 's going to be a tough job with the crazy crew i work with ! !
robert , london the cardiff and vale of glamorgan scout network will be joining other scouts from the area to virtually row , run and cycle the distance from cardiff to london between 16:30 - 18:30 today outside debenhams in st david 's arcade , cardiff .
please come and support us if you are in the city centre .
gareth , cardiff , wales " i will be manning the donation lines for the night " dan tremain , bromley as i work for one of the big companies that are allegedly hijacking comic relief to boost sales i will be manning the donation lines for the night .
dan tremain , bromley i am amazed that some people are writing in saying that they are ' charitied out ' .
i agree that we ca n't all keep giving to all the good causes out there , but that does n't mean we have to lose our compassion for those less fortunate both at home and abroad .
for the sake of £ 1 for a red nose -lrb- whether you wear it or not -rrb- you can add that little drop to the ocean .
if everyone in the uk bought a £ 1 red nose - it would raise £ 55 million - and that would go a very , very long way ...
clare , scotland a couple of teams from within our youth football club staged an rnd benefit match last weekend and raised £ 78 .
we hope to top that up towards the end of the month when we are staging a second benefit game for the red nose cause .
chris cox , fawley falcons youth f.c , southampton , uk the snide and selfish attitudes expressed by many here will be enough to make me take part .
peter , birmingham " so far we have raised over £ 200 " jo , birmingham my company is having a dress down day .
so far we have raised over £ 200 .
i can not believe some of these comments .
i would like to think that if the table was turned , africa would help us out .
i realise that people have probably given to the tsunami appeal , but africa still needs our help , as do the hundreds of charities in the uk who benefit .
stop being such kill joys ! !
jo , birmingham red clothes , red lipstick , red hair - cakes , quizzes and fun !
fiona , tina , cath , jill and louise , dundee , uk severn trent telephone room girls have brought jelly beans , put them into a pot and the other employees have to guess how many to win a bottle of bubbly .
we are also doing the sweepstake , of course wearing red noses and red hair .
mel halligan , birmingham , england well what happened to good old fashioned humour ?
i turned up for work in a spacesuit for red nose day , only to be told by my boss to ' sort myself out ' .
it 's no wonder so many people have stress related sick days .
tony , derby 4 of us are wearing wigs and generally having a laugh .
julie , glasgow , scotland i 've got the red gel in my hair , face paint on my face and my red nose hanging round my neck - and a big comic relief bucket by my desk for donations !
anj , reading in hbos financial services in leeds we have a tombola , cake stall , red nose cake raffle -lrb- i 've made a cake that looks like a nose ! -rrb- and quiz sheets , plus fining anyone not wearing red !
jane robson , leeds , england making cakes , red nose day sweepstake , and dressing up all red .
hope to give everyone a laugh or a stomach cramp after eating my cakes .
anyway , hope to add my small collection to the larger pot !
happy red nose day .
hannah , bedfordshire coming from the states , where the most organised charity appeal is the rather pathetic jerry lewis telethon , red nose day is a real treat and a great way to get people involved in giving to those less fortunate .
my daughter 's school has a full day of activities planned and i 've sent her off with a sack of pound coins to give away .
as for me , i 'll hitch my red nose to my bike basket and later this evening , tune into fame academy .
lisa , cambridge " hopefully we can do our bit " sandy , cambridgeshire the vets and nurses at the broadway vet hospital are wearing pyjamas and dressing gowns for the day - and it 's cold .
hopefully we can do our bit , we have our mascot molly the terrier here as well .
sandy , cambridgeshire my son 's school is getting them all to come in dressed in something red , and he 's got a mad ' barnett ' for the day too .
he 's been so excited about wearing this all week , i thought we 'd never get to friday !
fair play to the headmaster , he 's always up for anything which helps the children to get a perspective on the real world , and let 's face it the world is bonkers !
eoin , cornwall , uk please try to sell red noses etc through more outlets next time .
we do not have a sainsbury or oxfam shop locally and when i tried to buy goods over the net they were all sold out .
sue sorrell , blackburn , england our office for the first time ever celebrated red nose day and the girls made rolls and bacon and rolls and sausage - total £ 80 .
not bad for a small office .
lisa , uk i am sporting a ridiculously red hairstyle at work today and charging people for singing them a song .
so far we 've raised over £ 60 .
whooppee !
alison , broadstairs , uk myself and my colleagues are taking phone pledges until midnight .
mark , leeds , uk some people 's attitudes stink !
especially those who claim we should n't give money abroad .
they 're human too !
and besides , money goes to the uk too - get your facts right before posting !
ross , halesowen , uk two of my work colleagues - nicola and alex have cooked us all sausage and bacon sandwiches for breakfast and are doing the same for lunch !
we are all donating generously !
sophie cope , godalming , surrey our colleague bob gould is having his beard shaved off after 20 years and has raised £ 450 .
sheila evans , sevenoaks , kent , uk " dye your hair , have a laugh " lesley smart , carluke , scotland what an absolute joy it was in our house this morning , as my two sons , aged 4 and 11 , got ready for school / nursery , with their red hair spray , red clothes and red noses , having such fun but thinking of others .
yes we do have a lot of charities looking for our support , but is n't this a fun way of helping others .
go on dye your hair , have a laugh , at least we in this country are free to do these things if we wish .
lesley smart , carluke , scotland i bought the little britain dvd and have donated some money for cakes that someone 's kindly brought in !
paul , milton keynes we 're doing hair spraying , head shaving , and running a mega raffle with prizes including : win a mini for a week .
nottingham panthers players coming down at 1pm .
the cornerhouse in nottingham , nottingham , england " it 's one day of the year that we should all support " martin , brighton , uk i can not believe the attitude of some people .
it may be a little bit wacky but it 's one day of the year that we should all support , from our nice warm homes .
martin , brighton , uk comic relief would be great if only my school would allow us to do something .
we are not allowed to dye our hair red or put face paint on or even wear non-uniform .
louisa , reading , uk for me , comic relief has been hijacked by big retail companies who are more interested in boosting sales than donating to charities , and if the tv coverage follows the style of recent years it will be 80 % embarrassing , 10 % guilt and 10 % watchable entertainment .
jon dalladay , london , uk holding the ' great red nose bake-off ' .
talented colleagues bake cakes and every one pays £ 1 to eat them and vote on the best .
a great excuse to eat cake on a friday afternoon .
kirsten , glasgow i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i 'm fed up of red nose day and children in need and their ilk .
i give to various charities on a regular basis .
i do n't need what is essentially lazy television scheduling to try to persuade me to give more .
ian , leeds " i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume " rs , glasgow uk i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume and trying to make miserable old scrooges realise that living in one of the richest countries in the world carries responsibilities to ones fellow man .
oh , and making people feel guilty too .
rs , glasgow uk how much do we need to donate to keep ruby wax and robbie williams off our tvs ?
philippe , london , uk colouring my hair red , putting on a nose and a big smile and waiting for little britain 's comic relief special !
christine , uk while people may be tired of red nose day -lrb- and i am too , in fact i was never into it when it first came out -rrb- , i am dismayed at some of the comments here .
i may not like red nose day , but i do enjoy giving and helping out groups and charities of my choice , i am certainly not all charitied out .
the voluntary sector makes a massive difference to peoples lives locally , nationally and internationally and these hard working charities need out support .
if all charities were to disappear tomorrow we would soon know about it and the world would be much worse place .
it 's very easy to moan about giving from the comfort of your own laptop , having had the luck to be born in the west .
some people at my university are selling cookies for red nose day tomorrow , i will buy some of those and offload my small change to anyone with a collection box , it all helps .
i am glad that at least some people here are going all out in their fund raising efforts and wish them all the best , it 's good to see some charity and community spirit exists around here .
amy , colchester they should do what they did the other year .
every hour they picked someone who donated on the phone and they won vip tickets to a football match .
i feel more people would give if they felt they had a chance of winning something .
chris h , lincoln " i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it " alex young , grantham , lincs i 'm doing nothing .
i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it .
children in need should give it a rest for a few years .
it 's not that i 'm not a giving person , i give money to the odd charity now and then .
there should be a rnli day that is a charity that really needs the public donations .
alex young , grantham , lincs we have finally managed to persuade our school to have a non uniform day , and several people are shaving their hair off .
unfortunately , there does n't seem to be any red noses around where i live , otherwise i 'd buy one .
emily , cumbria , uk what am i doing ?
absolutely nothing .
i have charity fatigue and resent other people trying to make me feel guilty for not joining in days and days of begging by tin-rattlers , topped off by hours of unfunny ' comedy ' sketches .
if i want to give to charity , i will .
in my own time and not because it is pc to do so .
i hesitate to mention this as discretion is the better part of valour , but i do voluntary work , i just do n't feel the need to advertise the details of my deeds -lrb- or donations -rrb- on television .
nichola feeney , dundee , scotland i have decided to boycott comic relief this year and donate my money to other charities instead .
it was not a decision i made lightly , but the fact that this year 's theme is the same as last year 's , and the general coverage , has persuaded me that all anyone cares about anymore is celebrities mucking around in funny hairdos .
actually helping the disadvantaged seems like some sort of side issue .
r potter , cambridge , uk " this time red nose will get nothing from me " bumble , dartford , uk with so many charities chasing donation 's , is it little wonder that sooner or later we will all get charity fatigue .
so this time red nose will get nothing from me .
bumble , dartford , uk i will be out celebrating my birthday - probably wearing nothing but a hairy red nose !
rachel , ipswich , uk anyone see the episode of the office where they have red nose day ?
i am with tim - work 's idea of " wackiness " does n't really do it for me , but i will donate .
fraser , essex , england i will give some money and then go out instead of watching self-publicising celebrities prance about on tv .
it seems a coincidence to me that they 're so happy to give up their time when they have a book / musical / tv show to promote .
julie , brighton , england " when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term " paul , london i 'll be writing to my mp demanding that gordon brown keeps to his commitments to long term aid for the third world .
sorry to be a misery but comic relief money is a drop in the ocean and i find something obscene in multi-million salaried celebrities showing footage of starving children whilst being happy and nice and we all feel guilty , give some cash , pat ourselves on the back and feel like generally nice folk .
please people , when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term - comic relief will solve them for a fraction of the sufferers for a day .
paul , london ignoring it completely .
i give to the charities of my choice , not the charities i 'm told to give to by celebrities who " give their time for free " -lrb- read : gain some free self-publicity and tell me to open my wallet without opening their own -rrb- john b , uk money from appeals like this is sent to these people in order to help themselves -lrb- the presenters take great pains in telling us that all they want is to help themselves -rrb- .
the question is " why are these people still in need of such help after 20 years of red nose day ? " .
if this is all they want , i find it hard to believe that it would take 20 years .
i heard billy connolly try to shame us into believing that " compassion fatigue " is a myth , but after 20 years of donating and seeing no change in their situation , it is indeed a very real thing !
paul , nottingham , uk " red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off " william read , staffordshire nothing .
it is well past its sell by date , and the sooner it is put out of its misery the better .
red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off .
william read , stafford , staffordshire maybe i 'm selfish , but i do n't see the point in donating money abroad when we have our own problems to deal with , such as homelessness on our streets .
this has been going on for 20 years yet the same problems still exist abroad , i do n't think throwing some cash at them every year will ever solve it .
ed , ayrshire i have already done my bit by donating .
on the night i will be avoiding the tv screen at all costs .
the very thought of watching more than two minutes of ' comedians ' lenny henry , liza tarbuck and dawn french brings me out in hives .
leon , brighouse , uk will the public dig deep again ?
maybe the tsunami appeal has taken the country 's generosity ! come on people africa needs aid too !
dean chambers , castleford , uk the same as every year - buying a bottle of wine and watching films .
whilst i support charity , i want to choose those i support and do not want it rammed down my throat .
carolyn , england sorry , but i 'm all charity 'd out and wo n't watching or donating this year .
j , oxford " it has created a real buzz around the office " kiltie , staffs , uk we have managed to persuade our very staid company to allow us to have a fancy dress fun day .
we are having a fete theme with tombola stall , name the elephant , raffle , guess the babies plus prizes for the best and worst outfits .
staff are also doing their own little bits - ie two ladies are dressing as saloon girls and if they raise fifty pounds by 1pm they will go to tesco 's in their outfits to buy their lunch !
it has created a real buzz around the office and has been the only topic of conversation all day .
we ca n't wait ! ! !
kiltie , staffs , uk i wo n't be doing anything for red nose day as my work is relocating the following day and we have to pack away last minute things and help the removal men .
as for watching it , i find it the most pointless 6/7 hours and would rather be playing board games .
charity does not need blanket tv coverage .
by the way i have donated £ 10 to comic relief .
helen , leeds what will i be doing ?
doing my best to avoid aggressive tin-rattlers dressed in ridiculous costumes who will be doing their best to make me feel guilty , and failing miserably .
trevor , cambs , uk our office is going all out for red nose day , from sponsoring members of staff to dress up as cartoon characters to spot the red hairdo on our intranet .
not everyone is taking an active part , but everyone is giving something .
if everyone was a moany old skinflint like trevor there would n't be anyone left alive in third world countries !
cheer up it 's for a good cause !
kelly , edinburgh , scotland absolutely nothing apart from trying to avoid the irritating tin shakers on my way home in the evening .
i give to the charities i choose to , not the ones that have big enough budgets to try and guilt trip people into giving them money with footage of starving orphans .

comedians peter kay , dawn french , ricky gervais , lenny henry , ruby wax and liza tarbuck were among the stars who appeared on friday 's tv show on bbc 1 .
singers sir elton john , george michael and robbie williams also featured in little britain sketches broadcast during the seven-hour telethon .

your comments : i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " sass , somerset the school where i work has organised a strictly come dancing contest where the children are teaching teams of staff to perform dance routines and then children pay to vote for the winners .
i spent comic relief night in front of the telly , wildly fluctuating between laughter and tears watching the film cameos from africa - it makes you realise what a rich life we all are privileged to live here , when it takes so little to make others in desperate need so happy .
i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " - such a happy song and a simple but effective video .
hope it gets to number one !
i 'm happy to give time and money to causes like this , long may it continue .
sass , somerset well i spent the night working on the donation line - having been semi dragged into helping by a friend of mine .
i was incredibly glad she did do so - we only meant to stay till 10pm , but were still going when our call centre ran out of forms at 1.30am.
it was a brilliant and humbling experience .
people donated what they could from a few pounds to a thousand plus and the atmosphere was great .
completely different from my day job , but my way of helping comic relief - i could donate little so was glad to help where i could .
roz , bradford , uk we sponsored our good mate emma to dress as barbie for a full day of college .
she raised over £ 120 - well done girly : d becca , birmingham just donated - if i have to go without a few pints because a day which reminds us all how lucky we are and how unfortunate some are asks me to then that 's fine .
we all have a responsibility since it is in no small part the imposition of a particular western brand of economic capitalism on many nations which has left them playing catch-up .
evan , edinburgh people giving what they could afford stuart , cleethorpes , uk i was on the donation line last night and was completely humbled by all those who pledged , from a few pounds to a few hundred .
the amount did n't matter , it was people giving what they could afford .
to all those humbugs out there , i 'm sorry you will never know the pleasure of speaking to every single fantastic person who phoned us last night .
stuart , cleethorpes , uk two 6 year olds from west derby liverpool , rosa and scarlett made and sold red nose cakes and raised £ 40 for red nose day .

the leaf division sold red noses , and it was lots of fun .
i had my hair dyed red and i wore a suit .
simon chan , taunton , somerset staff and children of little rainbows day nursery wore wigs , red noses and dressed in colours of the rainbow .
the children have been busy making and selling badges , selling the red noses , staff and parents having a go on the official sweepstake and finally bringing into nursery lots of pennies to make a " mile of pennies " .

he did n't look best pleased , but had to grin and bear it , whilst handing over a £ 1 to the swear box .
jon murtagh , lincoln , uk in my office we are having office e-mail bingo , a football tournament , a team quiz , office olympics and numerous other fundraising events in addition to dressing up .
it 's one day of the year when raising money for charity also really raises a smile -lrb- even a giggle at the sight of your colleagues in a red wig , t-shirt and nose -rrb- .
rowan , livingston , scotland i work for royal mail and they are allowing me to dress up as elvis , -lrb- white cat suit , wig , glasses , etc -rrb- .
i will be delivering the mail on a stretch of chiswick high road .
vinny o 'connor , chiswick , london w4 after my shift at work i will be joining many colleagues from the call centre i work at in durham .

i do n't normally wear my hair short , let alone none at all !
dominique guyot , bristol , uk red nose day is a fantastic day !
it puts all problems into perspective , when you see the courage and bravery of people who go through so much with so little .
i do not understand how people can not donate to such a deserving cause .
naomi sharman , leeds most people at our work are not bothering to participate in our dressing up day but there 's a few red-haired people with their clothes on back to front , one person in pyjamas and a few red noses around .
david hilton , hudds , uk when i hear some of the comments on these pages , i feel ashamed to be british -lrb- and i 'm a very patriotic person -rrb- .
i 've just donated £ 100 on your behalf to make up for the moaning .
davu , buck i will be doing absolutely nothing , and refusing to pay for our dress-down day at work .
i will decide when i am going to donate to charity , and no-one is going to get money out of me any other way .
in fact , events like red nose day just force me to tighten the purse strings even more !
andy , leeds , uk my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day ian child , orpington , kent i have just finished reading the comments on this website and ca n't believe that there are people in this country that do n't care or are just not interested .
my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day .
ian child , orpington , kent all my work colleagues are dressed in red , buying wonderful home-made cakes , contributing financially .
in a very busy environment people are much more smiley and relaxed .
it does wonders for team working too !
jan , brighton as it 's red nose day i 've taken the day off work , as i do every red nose or children in need day .
why ?
because i refuse to pay £ 1 for a piddly slice of cake and being made to feel guilty if i do n't buy a piece .
red nose day is lame ...
it 's cringe worthy and embarrassing .
gemma , surrey we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london i work in a large london office , there is no indication whatsoever that this is red nose day .
nothing is red , nobody has dressed up , there are no special cakes and no collection box of any kind .
it 's not because anyone has banned it , it 's never been mentioned .
we 're all too busy doing our work ...
we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london , england nothing .
i fear that every time the nation gives to charity mr brown takes note , then he knows how much he can squeeze out of us with stealth taxes .
robert , london , uk i can not believe the attitude of most of the people on here !
i agree that we need to think long term about poverty , which is why i give so much a month to christian aid .
but most people do n't give regularly .
comic relief raises millions every year , of course that does some good !
caroline , oldham after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness catherine o , maidenhead , uk if these comments really do reflect the balance of public opinion , they paint a pretty depressing picture of british attitudes .
like many people , i make regular donations to good causes and do n't usually give to tv appeals but after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness .
catherine o , maidenhead , uk our school is very charity minded , we have kids and staff in all red , male staff in drag , sponsored walkers , dancers and silences ... you name it !
it 's a festival for a good cause !
vicki , london here in the cosmetics team at boots hq , the fellas in the team have agreed to a ' make-over ' if us girls raise £ 100 -lrb- well on our way -rrb- .
lipsticks , blush and nail polish at the ready !
lisa , notts , england well i 'm sitting typing this at work in my pyjamas .
i am the charity co-ordinator at my work and we always get so much from our colleagues !
i think that if we have things and other people do n't then we should help them out .
red nose day does n't come every year , so give as much as you can that 's what i say .
sara , aberdeen , scotland we have gone mad at work this year .
while most of us ca n't get away with wearing daft costumes , we are wearing red , but there are some cross-dressers kicking about , a bake-off , mad hair , mad clothes and everyone is giving their hard earned money with a really big smile on their faces .
even the " boring " ones have been persuaded to join in !
long live red nose day !
claire , chesterfield , uk we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour benedict taylor , long eaton , uk at trent college in long eaton my boarding house are doing a sponsored hymnathon .
we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour .
so far it looks as though we get around £ 250 for comic relief .
benedict taylor , long eaton , uk ignoring it .
this charity fest supports causes that are , in my opinion , not worthy target your giving and make sure it goes where its needed .
freddy , uk how can these people who claim to be ' charited out ' sleep at night ?
i believe if you can not put your hands in your pockets a couple of times a year in order to give to people less fortunate than your selves , then you live in a very cynical and selfish world .
most of us in the uk are privileged to lead comfortable lives , if you can not be bothered to support those who have the tenacity and courage to say " no this is not right , we can do something to help these people " then shame on you .
danny - yorkshire , goole uk i have baked some red nose biscuits , and am selling them for a minimum of 20p each , but hoping that people will donate more .
gina saunders , oxford , uk i 'm doing " sponsor a pigtail " at work !
for every donation of 50p i get from a colleague , i put an extra pigtail in my hair .
unfortunately it 's going down so well that my arms are aching , but it 's worth it to fill my little collecting box .
sarah b , york , uk i give by direct debit to 3 smaller charities every month -lrb- for the last 5 years -rrb- so i am no scrooge .
however , i find my self unimpressed and unmoved by the emotional blackmail tactics used on tv .
i also deplore the idealistic ' making poverty history ' claims -lrb- it ai n't gonna happen far to pie in the sky ! -rrb-
i will not watch the ego fest that is comic relief ; i am tired of seeing talent less publicity seeking so called ' celebs ' embarrassing attempts to " entertain " .
if they really cared , they just donate and save us the embarrassment .
i would rather give my hard earned cash to help charities of my choice in this country .
meg , grantham lincs sorry , has victor meldrew hijacked this forum as a fundraising gag ? - that 's the impression i 'm getting from all the whingeing and self-righteous comments on here !
but no , unfortunately the comments are genuine , and very disappointing .
i for one will be donating tonight and enjoying the entertainment , which hopefully will restore my faith .
long live comic relief !
mary , gloucester , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day -lrb- with red sauce -rrb- , we are wearing something red and for the afternoon we have strawberries and cream , mmmm .
the diet starts monday , after all it 's for charity !
elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk in our fish and chip shop we 've all contributed in wearing the red nose day t-shirts , spraying our hair red and going wild on the make up .
we all look so funny away from the boring uniform we all usually wear .
maria , kidderminster , uk the staff at british gas in leeds are taking phone pledges this evening until midnight .
stacey kerrigan , leeds , uk sprayed my three children 's ' hair red , spiked my hair and sprayed it red , bought them a red nose each , put money in the bucket at my sons school , think i 've done my bit for comic relief .
al , milton keynes , uk our college -lrb- sfx college , clapham -rrb- are doing a variety of events -lrb- which have been happening this week -rrb- held by our student council , this includes dressing up in your old school uniform , competitions and selling fair trade products , including drinks and food , they will also be selling the white wrists bands to promote making poverty history .
our college is hoping that we as a college community will raise lots of money for a great cause !
mel , london i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we are having a raffle with donated gifts -lrb- mostly alcohol ! -rrb- from staff , we have the red nose scratch and match and are selling cakes , etc which people kindly brought in .
we also have staff with red hair and one with not so much hair , so big red dots on his head !
i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we raised £ 250 last week holding a cake sale in the biological sciences department at the university of liverpool .
everyone was so generous , with some people paying up to £ 10 for 1 cake !
the microbiology department , liverpool , uk after a hectic morning of red hair dyes , face paint and frantic scrabbling for red clothes - i 've taken the children to school -lrb- non-uniform day , with lots of stalls to raise more money -rrb- , with a pocket full of change each and will now spend the day cleaning the house , so that tonight i can settle down with the family and watch some entertainment on tv !
i will probably end up crying my eyes out - and donating more money than i can afford - but hey !
that 's what comic relief is all about !
jb , essex i 'm going to my uni lectures dressed as a giant bumblebee iona knight , exeter , devon it 's all very well to say that you give to a charity of your choice but the fact is that an event like red nose day mobilizes a lot of people to actually do something to raise cash and also awareness .
people can raise a lot of money at planned events and along with the noses , car accessories , stickers , ring tones , etc a huge amount is generated for the charities in question .
i 'm not really the sort of person who would put myself out there doing something " wacky " either but i can see why it 's a good thing that a lot of people do and i certainly would n't begrudge them my cash .
ann , scotland message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work liz wood , reading all the kids in our primary school brought £ 1 in today for the privilege of dressing up and having red hair .
they are also doing a talent show this afternoon .
my daughter bryony and her friend conor are doing a sponsored silence tomorrow .
all the proceeds will go to red nose day .
all great fun ways to raise money for a great cause .
message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work !
nyree dick , coaltown of balgonie , fife dressed up as fairy .
liz wood , reading i think the red noses are brilliant , but the sheer amount of tv coverage is rather ott in my opinion .
my place of work is n't doing anything for comic relief .
i work in the reception so have stuck my red nose on top of my monitor to brighten things up .
it was my birthday yesterday so tonight i shall be celebrating that by going out for a meal with friends .
helen , southampton , uk what will i be doing ?
looking for a red nose !
why on earth only restrict selling them to sainsbury and oxfam - then allow them to sell out in south wales ?
why not treat them like poppies and sell everywhere ?
okay - rant over - but if it was n't for the good will of an old friend , my 6-year-old lad would have felt very left out in school today - as others no doubt will .
please fix it next year .
tony , wales well i beeped my horn at aled from the chris moyles red nose rally this morning in plymouth .
and our little office raised £ 50 with the sweepstake and an easter egg raffle .
linda , mandy , carol , pj and the rest of the girls at serpells , plymouth i ca n't believe some of the miserable , selfish people on here !

the traffic is at walking pace anyway during rush-hour , so we do n't delay anyone , and the great majority of people seem happy to have the chance to take part , and give cheerfully and generously .
michael cutler , marlow , bucks tony is singing everything he says !

becks , london we have dressed up one of our reporters at the wiltshire times in red nose kit .
i think it is vital for local newspapers to get in the mood and encourage the thousands of people who are making an effort to raise money for such a worthwhile cause .
craig evry , trowbridge , uk we 're a small elite company of structural and civil engineers with big hearts and the boss suggested we come in school uniform .

i 'm from hants , but have ne blood and got my degree up there .
sponsorship going well .
stu maddison , west london as someone who 's been involved in charity fundraising and voluntary work for years i 've read the other comments with a mixture of horror and anger .
let 's just remember that the key thing about charitably fundraising is that you give freely and willingly .
there 's no " feel guilty " about most of the collectors out there .
they 're doing something positive and you 're just being asked to support that .
as for the " self-serving actor " rubbish .
do me a favour wake up to yourselves .
sure there are a couple like that but the majority do it because they 're in a position to do something positive .
i 've seen that commitment up close and personal .

he looks great sitting in an open plan office .
dave love , kesgrave , england i shall be watching it and lending it my moral support .
i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i think it 's more important that people take the opportunity to contribute regularly to a charity or two throughout the year rather than give sporadically .
set up a direct debit to a charity for as little as a couple of pounds a month and everyone wins .
you feel good , the charity gets the money it needs .
the only drawback is that there would be no need for shows like tonight 's comic relief !
mo c , uk today we 're holding a raffle with prizes donated by the bosses ; dressing down in denim and red -lrb- quite brave for a solicitors ' office ! -rrb- and having an auction for a fast boat trip .
we 'll probably only raise about £ 300 but every penny helps .
bearing in mind that people have given generously to the tsunami appeal , we 'll be happy about any amount we raise .
sue , southampton , uk to those who rattle their tins and dress in ridiculous costumes and try to make me feel guilty for not joining in the " fun " : you 've no idea whether i give up my evenings and weekends to work in a homeless shelter ; you do n't know that i 'm not an activist for amnesty international ; you have n't a clue what charities i support with tax-efficient , gift-aided standing orders .
this may be one day for you , but please do n't judge everyone by your standards and assume the stony-faced people who are avoiding you are uncharitable .
some of them are just fed up with the patronising and accusing judgements .
anon i was on a tall ships youth trust square rig sailing ship -lrb- stavros s niarchos -rrb- in the canaries last week and i climbed to the top of the 45 metre mast to raise money for comic relief .

gareth , cardiff , wales i will be manning the donation lines for the night dan tremain , bromley as i work for one of the big companies that are allegedly hijacking comic relief to boost sales i will be manning the donation lines for the night .
dan tremain , bromley i am amazed that some people are writing in saying that they are ' charitied out ' .
i agree that we ca n't all keep giving to all the good causes out there , but that does n't mean we have to lose our compassion for those less fortunate both at home and abroad .
for the sake of £ 1 for a red nose -lrb- whether you wear it or not -rrb- you can add that little drop to the ocean .
if everyone in the uk bought a £ 1 red nose - it would raise £ 55 million - and that would go a very , very long way ...
clare , scotland a couple of teams from within our youth football club staged an rnd benefit match last weekend and raised £ 78 .
we hope to top that up towards the end of the month when we are staging a second benefit game for the red nose cause .
chris cox , fawley falcons youth f.c , southampton , uk the snide and selfish attitudes expressed by many here will be enough to make me take part .
peter , birmingham so far we have raised over £ 200 jo , birmingham my company is having a dress down day .
so far we have raised over £ 200 .
i can not believe some of these comments .
i would like to think that if the table was turned , africa would help us out .
i realise that people have probably given to the tsunami appeal , but africa still needs our help , as do the hundreds of charities in the uk who benefit .
stop being such kill joys ! !
jo , birmingham red clothes , red lipstick , red hair - cakes , quizzes and fun !
fiona , tina , cath , jill and louise , dundee , uk severn trent telephone room girls have brought jelly beans , put them into a pot and the other employees have to guess how many to win a bottle of bubbly .

mel halligan , birmingham , england well what happened to good old fashioned humour ?
i turned up for work in a spacesuit for red nose day , only to be told by my boss to ' sort myself out ' .
it 's no wonder so many people have stress related sick days .

hope to give everyone a laugh or a stomach cramp after eating my cakes .
anyway , hope to add my small collection to the larger pot !
happy red nose day .
hannah , bedfordshire coming from the states , where the most organised charity appeal is the rather pathetic jerry lewis telethon , red nose day is a real treat and a great way to get people involved in giving to those less fortunate .
my daughter 's school has a full day of activities planned and i 've sent her off with a sack of pound coins to give away .
as for me , i 'll hitch my red nose to my bike basket and later this evening , tune into fame academy .
lisa , cambridge hopefully we can do our bit sandy , cambridgeshire the vets and nurses at the broadway vet hospital are wearing pyjamas and dressing gowns for the day - and it 's cold .
hopefully we can do our bit , we have our mascot molly the terrier here as well .
sandy , cambridgeshire my son 's school is getting them all to come in dressed in something red , and he 's got a mad ' barnett ' for the day too .
he 's been so excited about wearing this all week , i thought we 'd never get to friday !
fair play to the headmaster , he 's always up for anything which helps the children to get a perspective on the real world , and let 's face it the world is bonkers !
eoin , cornwall , uk please try to sell red noses etc through more outlets next time .
we do not have a sainsbury or oxfam shop locally and when i tried to buy goods over the net they were all sold out .
sue sorrell , blackburn , england our office for the first time ever celebrated red nose day and the girls made rolls and bacon and rolls and sausage - total £ 80 .

alison , broadstairs , uk myself and my colleagues are taking phone pledges until midnight .

yes we do have a lot of charities looking for our support , but is n't this a fun way of helping others .
go on dye your hair , have a laugh , at least we in this country are free to do these things if we wish .
lesley smart , carluke , scotland i bought the little britain dvd and have donated some money for cakes that someone 's kindly brought in !

it may be a little bit wacky but it 's one day of the year that we should all support , from our nice warm homes .
martin , brighton , uk comic relief would be great if only my school would allow us to do something .
we are not allowed to dye our hair red or put face paint on or even wear non-uniform .
louisa , reading , uk for me , comic relief has been hijacked by big retail companies who are more interested in boosting sales than donating to charities , and if the tv coverage follows the style of recent years it will be 80 % embarrassing , 10 % guilt and 10 % watchable entertainment .
jon dalladay , london , uk holding the ' great red nose bake-off ' .
talented colleagues bake cakes and every one pays £ 1 to eat them and vote on the best .
a great excuse to eat cake on a friday afternoon .
kirsten , glasgow i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i 'm fed up of red nose day and children in need and their ilk .

ian , leeds i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume rs , glasgow uk i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume and trying to make miserable old scrooges realise that living in one of the richest countries in the world carries responsibilities to ones fellow man .
oh , and making people feel guilty too .
rs , glasgow uk how much do we need to donate to keep ruby wax and robbie williams off our tvs ?

christine , uk while people may be tired of red nose day -lrb- and i am too , in fact i was never into it when it first came out -rrb- , i am dismayed at some of the comments here .
i may not like red nose day , but i do enjoy giving and helping out groups and charities of my choice , i am certainly not all charitied out .
the voluntary sector makes a massive difference to peoples lives locally , nationally and internationally and these hard working charities need out support .
if all charities were to disappear tomorrow we would soon know about it and the world would be much worse place .
it 's very easy to moan about giving from the comfort of your own laptop , having had the luck to be born in the west .
some people at my university are selling cookies for red nose day tomorrow , i will buy some of those and offload my small change to anyone with a collection box , it all helps .
i am glad that at least some people here are going all out in their fund raising efforts and wish them all the best , it 's good to see some charity and community spirit exists around here .
amy , colchester they should do what they did the other year .
every hour they picked someone who donated on the phone and they won vip tickets to a football match .
i feel more people would give if they felt they had a chance of winning something .
chris h , lincoln i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it alex young , grantham , lincs i 'm doing nothing .
i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it .
children in need should give it a rest for a few years .
it 's not that i 'm not a giving person , i give money to the odd charity now and then .
there should be a rnli day that is a charity that really needs the public donations .
alex young , grantham , lincs we have finally managed to persuade our school to have a non uniform day , and several people are shaving their hair off .
unfortunately , there does n't seem to be any red noses around where i live , otherwise i 'd buy one .
emily , cumbria , uk what am i doing ?
absolutely nothing .
i have charity fatigue and resent other people trying to make me feel guilty for not joining in days and days of begging by tin-rattlers , topped off by hours of unfunny ' comedy ' sketches .
if i want to give to charity , i will .
in my own time and not because it is pc to do so .
i hesitate to mention this as discretion is the better part of valour , but i do voluntary work , i just do n't feel the need to advertise the details of my deeds -lrb- or donations -rrb- on television .
nichola feeney , dundee , scotland i have decided to boycott comic relief this year and donate my money to other charities instead .
it was not a decision i made lightly , but the fact that this year 's theme is the same as last year 's , and the general coverage , has persuaded me that all anyone cares about anymore is celebrities mucking around in funny hairdos .
actually helping the disadvantaged seems like some sort of side issue .
r potter , cambridge , uk this time red nose will get nothing from me bumble , dartford , uk with so many charities chasing donation 's , is it little wonder that sooner or later we will all get charity fatigue .
so this time red nose will get nothing from me .
bumble , dartford , uk i will be out celebrating my birthday - probably wearing nothing but a hairy red nose !
rachel , ipswich , uk anyone see the episode of the office where they have red nose day ?
i am with tim - work 's idea of " wackiness " does n't really do it for me , but i will donate .
fraser , essex , england i will give some money and then go out instead of watching self-publicising celebrities prance about on tv .
it seems a coincidence to me that they 're so happy to give up their time when they have a book / musical / tv show to promote .
julie , brighton , england when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term paul , london i 'll be writing to my mp demanding that gordon brown keeps to his commitments to long term aid for the third world .
sorry to be a misery but comic relief money is a drop in the ocean and i find something obscene in multi-million salaried celebrities showing footage of starving children whilst being happy and nice and we all feel guilty , give some cash , pat ourselves on the back and feel like generally nice folk .
please people , when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term - comic relief will solve them for a fraction of the sufferers for a day .
paul , london ignoring it completely .
i give to the charities of my choice , not the charities i 'm told to give to by celebrities who " give their time for free " -lrb- read : gain some free self-publicity and tell me to open my wallet without opening their own -rrb- john b , uk money from appeals like this is sent to these people in order to help themselves -lrb- the presenters take great pains in telling us that all they want is to help themselves -rrb- .
the question is " why are these people still in need of such help after 20 years of red nose day ? " .
if this is all they want , i find it hard to believe that it would take 20 years .
i heard billy connolly try to shame us into believing that " compassion fatigue " is a myth , but after 20 years of donating and seeing no change in their situation , it is indeed a very real thing !
paul , nottingham , uk red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off william read , staffordshire nothing .
it is well past its sell by date , and the sooner it is put out of its misery the better .
red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off .
william read , stafford , staffordshire maybe i 'm selfish , but i do n't see the point in donating money abroad when we have our own problems to deal with , such as homelessness on our streets .
this has been going on for 20 years yet the same problems still exist abroad , i do n't think throwing some cash at them every year will ever solve it .
ed , ayrshire i have already done my bit by donating .
on the night i will be avoiding the tv screen at all costs .
the very thought of watching more than two minutes of ' comedians ' lenny henry , liza tarbuck and dawn french brings me out in hives .
leon , brighouse , uk will the public dig deep again ?
maybe the tsunami appeal has taken the country 's generosity ! come on people africa needs aid too !
dean chambers , castleford , uk the same as every year - buying a bottle of wine and watching films .
whilst i support charity , i want to choose those i support and do not want it rammed down my throat .
carolyn , england sorry , but i 'm all charity 'd out and wo n't watching or donating this year .
j , oxford it has created a real buzz around the office kiltie , staffs , uk we have managed to persuade our very staid company to allow us to have a fancy dress fun day .
we are having a fete theme with tombola stall , name the elephant , raffle , guess the babies plus prizes for the best and worst outfits .
staff are also doing their own little bits - ie two ladies are dressing as saloon girls and if they raise fifty pounds by 1pm they will go to tesco 's in their outfits to buy their lunch !
it has created a real buzz around the office and has been the only topic of conversation all day .
we ca n't wait ! ! !
kiltie , staffs , uk i wo n't be doing anything for red nose day as my work is relocating the following day and we have to pack away last minute things and help the removal men .
as for watching it , i find it the most pointless 6/7 hours and would rather be playing board games .
charity does not need blanket tv coverage .
by the way i have donated £ 10 to comic relief .
helen , leeds what will i be doing ?
doing my best to avoid aggressive tin-rattlers dressed in ridiculous costumes who will be doing their best to make me feel guilty , and failing miserably .
trevor , cambs , uk our office is going all out for red nose day , from sponsoring members of staff to dress up as cartoon characters to spot the red hairdo on our intranet .
not everyone is taking an active part , but everyone is giving something .
if everyone was a moany old skinflint like trevor there would n't be anyone left alive in third world countries !
cheer up it 's for a good cause !
kelly , edinburgh , scotland absolutely nothing apart from trying to avoid the irritating tin shakers on my way home in the evening .
i give to the charities i choose to , not the ones that have big enough budgets to try and guilt trip people into giving them money with footage of starving orphans .

this year 's theme was " big hair and beyond " and it was also the twentieth anniversary of the charity which aims to tackle poverty and social injustice in the uk and africa .
comedians peter kay , dawn french , ricky gervais , lenny henry , ruby wax and liza tarbuck were among the stars who appeared on friday 's tv show on bbc 1 .
singers sir elton john , george michael and robbie williams also featured in little britain sketches broadcast during the seven-hour telethon .

your comments : i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " sass , somerset the school where i work has organised a strictly come dancing contest where the children are teaching teams of staff to perform dance routines and then children pay to vote for the winners .
i spent comic relief night in front of the telly , wildly fluctuating between laughter and tears watching the film cameos from africa - it makes you realise what a rich life we all are privileged to live here , when it takes so little to make others in desperate need so happy .
i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " - such a happy song and a simple but effective video .
hope it gets to number one !
i 'm happy to give time and money to causes like this , long may it continue .
sass , somerset well i spent the night working on the donation line - having been semi dragged into helping by a friend of mine .
i was incredibly glad she did do so - we only meant to stay till 10pm , but were still going when our call centre ran out of forms at 1.30am.
it was a brilliant and humbling experience .
people donated what they could from a few pounds to a thousand plus and the atmosphere was great .
completely different from my day job , but my way of helping comic relief - i could donate little so was glad to help where i could .
roz , bradford , uk we sponsored our good mate emma to dress as barbie for a full day of college .
she raised over £ 120 - well done girly : d becca , birmingham just donated - if i have to go without a few pints because a day which reminds us all how lucky we are and how unfortunate some are asks me to then that 's fine .
we all have a responsibility since it is in no small part the imposition of a particular western brand of economic capitalism on many nations which has left them playing catch-up .
evan , edinburgh people giving what they could afford stuart , cleethorpes , uk i was on the donation line last night and was completely humbled by all those who pledged , from a few pounds to a few hundred .
the amount did n't matter , it was people giving what they could afford .
to all those humbugs out there , i 'm sorry you will never know the pleasure of speaking to every single fantastic person who phoned us last night .
stuart , cleethorpes , uk two 6 year olds from west derby liverpool , rosa and scarlett made and sold red nose cakes and raised £ 40 for red nose day .
it was very cold and windy but we did n't mind because we wanted to care for the children in africa .

i personally did the donations , and donations from the council alone accumulated to at least £ 120 .
the leaf division sold red noses , and it was lots of fun .
i had my hair dyed red and i wore a suit .
simon chan , taunton , somerset staff and children of little rainbows day nursery wore wigs , red noses and dressed in colours of the rainbow .
the children have been busy making and selling badges , selling the red noses , staff and parents having a go on the official sweepstake and finally bringing into nursery lots of pennies to make a " mile of pennies " .
in total we raised £ 191.33 sandra wheeler , barrow-in-furness , cumbria , england it 's 3am and we 've just got in from " work " !
the contact centre where we work for jobcentre plus , was open to take pledges from 7pm until 2am taking in excess of £ 150,000 .
it was a great evening and a pleasure to be involved in such a good cause .
congratulations to all the organisers , you did a fantastic job !
helen and iain , telford , shropshire i dressed as elvis and sang loudly at the unsuspecting public in bath , making over 500 pounds over the day !
me and many other members of university rags raised tens of thousands in street collections and silly stunts across the country .
huseyin , bath , uk ca n't believe some people on here are moaning about red nose day ...
my kids were up early this morning for red hair colour and no uniform at school .
great stuff .
raising money for charity and a bit of fun as well .
long may it continue .
john , london , uk i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair jon murtagh , lincoln i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair .
he did n't look best pleased , but had to grin and bear it , whilst handing over a £ 1 to the swear box .
jon murtagh , lincoln , uk in my office we are having office e-mail bingo , a football tournament , a team quiz , office olympics and numerous other fundraising events in addition to dressing up .
it 's one day of the year when raising money for charity also really raises a smile -lrb- even a giggle at the sight of your colleagues in a red wig , t-shirt and nose -rrb- .
rowan , livingston , scotland i work for royal mail and they are allowing me to dress up as elvis , -lrb- white cat suit , wig , glasses , etc -rrb- .
i will be delivering the mail on a stretch of chiswick high road .
vinny o 'connor , chiswick , london w4 after my shift at work i will be joining many colleagues from the call centre i work at in durham .
we will be taking the pledges from viewers of comic relief - we are all volunteering until 2am so dig deep ! ! !
julie , tyne & wear i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues dominique guyot , bristol , uk i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues .
a qualified hairdresser has agreed to come and do it .
i 've managed to raise £ 300 in sponsorship money from friends and colleagues .
i do n't normally wear my hair short , let alone none at all !
dominique guyot , bristol , uk red nose day is a fantastic day !
it puts all problems into perspective , when you see the courage and bravery of people who go through so much with so little .
i do not understand how people can not donate to such a deserving cause .
naomi sharman , leeds most people at our work are not bothering to participate in our dressing up day but there 's a few red-haired people with their clothes on back to front , one person in pyjamas and a few red noses around .
david hilton , hudds , uk when i hear some of the comments on these pages , i feel ashamed to be british -lrb- and i 'm a very patriotic person -rrb- .
i 've just donated £ 100 on your behalf to make up for the moaning .
davu , buck i will be doing absolutely nothing , and refusing to pay for our dress-down day at work .
i will decide when i am going to donate to charity , and no-one is going to get money out of me any other way .
in fact , events like red nose day just force me to tighten the purse strings even more !
andy , leeds , uk my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day ian child , orpington , kent i have just finished reading the comments on this website and ca n't believe that there are people in this country that do n't care or are just not interested .
my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day .
ian child , orpington , kent all my work colleagues are dressed in red , buying wonderful home-made cakes , contributing financially .
in a very busy environment people are much more smiley and relaxed .
it does wonders for team working too !
jan , brighton as it 's red nose day i 've taken the day off work , as i do every red nose or children in need day .
why ?
because i refuse to pay £ 1 for a piddly slice of cake and being made to feel guilty if i do n't buy a piece .
red nose day is lame ...
it 's cringe worthy and embarrassing .
gemma , surrey we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london i work in a large london office , there is no indication whatsoever that this is red nose day .
nothing is red , nobody has dressed up , there are no special cakes and no collection box of any kind .
it 's not because anyone has banned it , it 's never been mentioned .
we 're all too busy doing our work ...
we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london , england nothing .
i fear that every time the nation gives to charity mr brown takes note , then he knows how much he can squeeze out of us with stealth taxes .
robert , london , uk i can not believe the attitude of most of the people on here !
i agree that we need to think long term about poverty , which is why i give so much a month to christian aid .
but most people do n't give regularly .
comic relief raises millions every year , of course that does some good !
caroline , oldham after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness catherine o , maidenhead , uk if these comments really do reflect the balance of public opinion , they paint a pretty depressing picture of british attitudes .
like many people , i make regular donations to good causes and do n't usually give to tv appeals but after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness .
catherine o , maidenhead , uk our school is very charity minded , we have kids and staff in all red , male staff in drag , sponsored walkers , dancers and silences ... you name it !
it 's a festival for a good cause !
vicki , london here in the cosmetics team at boots hq , the fellas in the team have agreed to a ' make-over ' if us girls raise £ 100 -lrb- well on our way -rrb- .
lipsticks , blush and nail polish at the ready !
lisa , notts , england well i 'm sitting typing this at work in my pyjamas .
i am the charity co-ordinator at my work and we always get so much from our colleagues !
i think that if we have things and other people do n't then we should help them out .
red nose day does n't come every year , so give as much as you can that 's what i say .
sara , aberdeen , scotland we have gone mad at work this year .
while most of us ca n't get away with wearing daft costumes , we are wearing red , but there are some cross-dressers kicking about , a bake-off , mad hair , mad clothes and everyone is giving their hard earned money with a really big smile on their faces .
even the " boring " ones have been persuaded to join in !
long live red nose day !
claire , chesterfield , uk we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour benedict taylor , long eaton , uk at trent college in long eaton my boarding house are doing a sponsored hymnathon .
we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour .
so far it looks as though we get around £ 250 for comic relief .
benedict taylor , long eaton , uk ignoring it .
this charity fest supports causes that are , in my opinion , not worthy target your giving and make sure it goes where its needed .
freddy , uk how can these people who claim to be ' charited out ' sleep at night ?
i believe if you can not put your hands in your pockets a couple of times a year in order to give to people less fortunate than your selves , then you live in a very cynical and selfish world .
most of us in the uk are privileged to lead comfortable lives , if you can not be bothered to support those who have the tenacity and courage to say " no this is not right , we can do something to help these people " then shame on you .
danny - yorkshire , goole uk i have baked some red nose biscuits , and am selling them for a minimum of 20p each , but hoping that people will donate more .
gina saunders , oxford , uk i 'm doing " sponsor a pigtail " at work !
for every donation of 50p i get from a colleague , i put an extra pigtail in my hair .
unfortunately it 's going down so well that my arms are aching , but it 's worth it to fill my little collecting box .
sarah b , york , uk i give by direct debit to 3 smaller charities every month -lrb- for the last 5 years -rrb- so i am no scrooge .
however , i find my self unimpressed and unmoved by the emotional blackmail tactics used on tv .
i also deplore the idealistic ' making poverty history ' claims -lrb- it ai n't gonna happen far to pie in the sky ! -rrb-
i will not watch the ego fest that is comic relief ; i am tired of seeing talent less publicity seeking so called ' celebs ' embarrassing attempts to " entertain " .
if they really cared , they just donate and save us the embarrassment .
i would rather give my hard earned cash to help charities of my choice in this country .
meg , grantham lincs sorry , has victor meldrew hijacked this forum as a fundraising gag ? - that 's the impression i 'm getting from all the whingeing and self-righteous comments on here !
but no , unfortunately the comments are genuine , and very disappointing .
i for one will be donating tonight and enjoying the entertainment , which hopefully will restore my faith .
long live comic relief !
mary , gloucester , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day -lrb- with red sauce -rrb- , we are wearing something red and for the afternoon we have strawberries and cream , mmmm .
the diet starts monday , after all it 's for charity !
elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk in our fish and chip shop we 've all contributed in wearing the red nose day t-shirts , spraying our hair red and going wild on the make up .
we all look so funny away from the boring uniform we all usually wear .
maria , kidderminster , uk the staff at british gas in leeds are taking phone pledges this evening until midnight .
stacey kerrigan , leeds , uk sprayed my three children 's ' hair red , spiked my hair and sprayed it red , bought them a red nose each , put money in the bucket at my sons school , think i 've done my bit for comic relief .
al , milton keynes , uk our college -lrb- sfx college , clapham -rrb- are doing a variety of events -lrb- which have been happening this week -rrb- held by our student council , this includes dressing up in your old school uniform , competitions and selling fair trade products , including drinks and food , they will also be selling the white wrists bands to promote making poverty history .
our college is hoping that we as a college community will raise lots of money for a great cause !
mel , london i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we are having a raffle with donated gifts -lrb- mostly alcohol ! -rrb- from staff , we have the red nose scratch and match and are selling cakes , etc which people kindly brought in .
we also have staff with red hair and one with not so much hair , so big red dots on his head !
i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we raised £ 250 last week holding a cake sale in the biological sciences department at the university of liverpool .
everyone was so generous , with some people paying up to £ 10 for 1 cake !
the microbiology department , liverpool , uk after a hectic morning of red hair dyes , face paint and frantic scrabbling for red clothes - i 've taken the children to school -lrb- non-uniform day , with lots of stalls to raise more money -rrb- , with a pocket full of change each and will now spend the day cleaning the house , so that tonight i can settle down with the family and watch some entertainment on tv !
i will probably end up crying my eyes out - and donating more money than i can afford - but hey !
that 's what comic relief is all about !
jb , essex i 'm going to my uni lectures dressed as a giant bumblebee iona knight , exeter , devon it 's all very well to say that you give to a charity of your choice but the fact is that an event like red nose day mobilizes a lot of people to actually do something to raise cash and also awareness .
people can raise a lot of money at planned events and along with the noses , car accessories , stickers , ring tones , etc a huge amount is generated for the charities in question .
i 'm not really the sort of person who would put myself out there doing something " wacky " either but i can see why it 's a good thing that a lot of people do and i certainly would n't begrudge them my cash .
ann , scotland message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work liz wood , reading all the kids in our primary school brought £ 1 in today for the privilege of dressing up and having red hair .
they are also doing a talent show this afternoon .
my daughter bryony and her friend conor are doing a sponsored silence tomorrow .
all the proceeds will go to red nose day .
all great fun ways to raise money for a great cause .
message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work !
nyree dick , coaltown of balgonie , fife dressed up as fairy .
liz wood , reading i think the red noses are brilliant , but the sheer amount of tv coverage is rather ott in my opinion .
my place of work is n't doing anything for comic relief .
i work in the reception so have stuck my red nose on top of my monitor to brighten things up .
it was my birthday yesterday so tonight i shall be celebrating that by going out for a meal with friends .
helen , southampton , uk what will i be doing ?
looking for a red nose !
why on earth only restrict selling them to sainsbury and oxfam - then allow them to sell out in south wales ?
why not treat them like poppies and sell everywhere ?
okay - rant over - but if it was n't for the good will of an old friend , my 6-year-old lad would have felt very left out in school today - as others no doubt will .
please fix it next year .

graeme ellis , warwick today we are all dressed in red and are holding an afternoon tea of cucumber sandwiches and cakes for our colleagues . £ 2.50 each to attend , so social too .
lots of takers .
sarah k , cambridge sponsorship going well stu maddison , west london dressed as a sunderland footballer for the day , complete with flatcap and ne accent .
my legs have attracted comment and the quality of my accent has varied .
i 'm from hants , but have ne blood and got my degree up there .
sponsorship going well .
stu maddison , west london as someone who 's been involved in charity fundraising and voluntary work for years i 've read the other comments with a mixture of horror and anger .
let 's just remember that the key thing about charitably fundraising is that you give freely and willingly .
there 's no " feel guilty " about most of the collectors out there .
they 're doing something positive and you 're just being asked to support that .
as for the " self-serving actor " rubbish .
do me a favour wake up to yourselves .
sure there are a couple like that but the majority do it because they 're in a position to do something positive .
i 've seen that commitment up close and personal .

leanne , cornwall it 's a real good fun atmosphere hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset i work for the local government and all 900 people in the building have been giving me money for comic relief .
it 's a real good fun atmosphere in here today and i reckon we will break £ 1000 by next week ! !
hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset we are donating the fares from one tram to comic relief - which could be up to £ 5,000 !
the chosen tram will be decorated with posters highlighting it as the ' red nose day tram ' .
nottingham 's trams , nottingham , uk the staff at highways agency office in birmingham are seeing red and losing their heads ! !
several sponsored events include dressing as a clown , shaving half of a beard off and having a very dodgy red mullet-do ! !
also tea and cake sales have been arranged for this lunchtime and most people are wearing red items of clothing and donating a £ 1 to support comic relief .
laura , birmingham we here at bt parkside in coventry are preparing to man some of the donation lines for tonight 's pledges ... wish us luck .
sarah 's team , coventry , uk at 11 o 'clock on friday 11th we just waxed 11 legs from 6 volunteers .
they were all men and screamed like babies .
sarah lewendon , basingstoke a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard dave love , kesgrave , england a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard - and he looks a bit like a lady !
he looks great sitting in an open plan office .
dave love , kesgrave , england i shall be watching it and lending it my moral support .
i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i think it 's more important that people take the opportunity to contribute regularly to a charity or two throughout the year rather than give sporadically .
set up a direct debit to a charity for as little as a couple of pounds a month and everyone wins .
you feel good , the charity gets the money it needs .
the only drawback is that there would be no need for shows like tonight 's comic relief !
mo c , uk today we 're holding a raffle with prizes donated by the bosses ; dressing down in denim and red -lrb- quite brave for a solicitors ' office ! -rrb- and having an auction for a fast boat trip .
we 'll probably only raise about £ 300 but every penny helps .
bearing in mind that people have given generously to the tsunami appeal , we 'll be happy about any amount we raise .
sue , southampton , uk to those who rattle their tins and dress in ridiculous costumes and try to make me feel guilty for not joining in the " fun " : you 've no idea whether i give up my evenings and weekends to work in a homeless shelter ; you do n't know that i 'm not an activist for amnesty international ; you have n't a clue what charities i support with tax-efficient , gift-aided standing orders .
this may be one day for you , but please do n't judge everyone by your standards and assume the stony-faced people who are avoiding you are uncharitable .
some of them are just fed up with the patronising and accusing judgements .
anon i was on a tall ships youth trust square rig sailing ship -lrb- stavros s niarchos -rrb- in the canaries last week and i climbed to the top of the 45 metre mast to raise money for comic relief .
i have raised over £ 750 so far from sponsors where i work - boden - and from fellow crew members on the ship .
pete lemon , great hampden , uk i am being sponsored to be silent in the office all day !
it 's going to be a tough job with the crazy crew i work with ! !
robert , london the cardiff and vale of glamorgan scout network will be joining other scouts from the area to virtually row , run and cycle the distance from cardiff to london between 16:30 - 18:30 today outside debenhams in st david 's arcade , cardiff .
please come and support us if you are in the city centre .
gareth , cardiff , wales i will be manning the donation lines for the night dan tremain , bromley as i work for one of the big companies that are allegedly hijacking comic relief to boost sales i will be manning the donation lines for the night .
dan tremain , bromley i am amazed that some people are writing in saying that they are ' charitied out ' .
i agree that we ca n't all keep giving to all the good causes out there , but that does n't mean we have to lose our compassion for those less fortunate both at home and abroad .
for the sake of £ 1 for a red nose -lrb- whether you wear it or not -rrb- you can add that little drop to the ocean .
if everyone in the uk bought a £ 1 red nose - it would raise £ 55 million - and that would go a very , very long way ...

your comments : i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " sass , somerset the school where i work has organised a strictly come dancing contest where the children are teaching teams of staff to perform dance routines and then children pay to vote for the winners .
i spent comic relief night in front of the telly , wildly fluctuating between laughter and tears watching the film cameos from africa - it makes you realise what a rich life we all are privileged to live here , when it takes so little to make others in desperate need so happy .
i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " - such a happy song and a simple but effective video .
hope it gets to number one !
i 'm happy to give time and money to causes like this , long may it continue .
sass , somerset well i spent the night working on the donation line - having been semi dragged into helping by a friend of mine .
i was incredibly glad she did do so - we only meant to stay till 10pm , but were still going when our call centre ran out of forms at 1.30am.
it was a brilliant and humbling experience .
people donated what they could from a few pounds to a thousand plus and the atmosphere was great .
completely different from my day job , but my way of helping comic relief - i could donate little so was glad to help where i could .
roz , bradford , uk we sponsored our good mate emma to dress as barbie for a full day of college .
she raised over £ 120 - well done girly : d becca , birmingham just donated - if i have to go without a few pints because a day which reminds us all how lucky we are and how unfortunate some are asks me to then that 's fine .
we all have a responsibility since it is in no small part the imposition of a particular western brand of economic capitalism on many nations which has left them playing catch-up .
evan , edinburgh people giving what they could afford stuart , cleethorpes , uk i was on the donation line last night and was completely humbled by all those who pledged , from a few pounds to a few hundred .
the amount did n't matter , it was people giving what they could afford .
to all those humbugs out there , i 'm sorry you will never know the pleasure of speaking to every single fantastic person who phoned us last night .
stuart , cleethorpes , uk two 6 year olds from west derby liverpool , rosa and scarlett made and sold red nose cakes and raised £ 40 for red nose day .
it was very cold and windy but we did n't mind because we wanted to care for the children in africa .
rosa harrison , liverpool , uk balmoral ward at southend hospital have raised £ 306 for comic relief .
thanks to all staff and patients who gave so generously .
nicky stone , southend , uk third thorley brownies became " red " ies for a day and raised 10 pounds by dressing in red and playing fun games .

rita eustace , bishop 's stortford , uk photos were taken of people with funny hair dos simon chan , taunton , somerset our college council organised a rnd hair do competition where photos were taken of people with funny hair dos , and prizes were provided by local companies .
i personally did the donations , and donations from the council alone accumulated to at least £ 120 .
the leaf division sold red noses , and it was lots of fun .
i had my hair dyed red and i wore a suit .
simon chan , taunton , somerset staff and children of little rainbows day nursery wore wigs , red noses and dressed in colours of the rainbow .
the children have been busy making and selling badges , selling the red noses , staff and parents having a go on the official sweepstake and finally bringing into nursery lots of pennies to make a " mile of pennies " .
in total we raised £ 191.33 sandra wheeler , barrow-in-furness , cumbria , england it 's 3am and we 've just got in from " work " !
the contact centre where we work for jobcentre plus , was open to take pledges from 7pm until 2am taking in excess of £ 150,000 .
it was a great evening and a pleasure to be involved in such a good cause .
congratulations to all the organisers , you did a fantastic job !
helen and iain , telford , shropshire i dressed as elvis and sang loudly at the unsuspecting public in bath , making over 500 pounds over the day !
me and many other members of university rags raised tens of thousands in street collections and silly stunts across the country .
huseyin , bath , uk ca n't believe some people on here are moaning about red nose day ...
my kids were up early this morning for red hair colour and no uniform at school .
great stuff .
raising money for charity and a bit of fun as well .
long may it continue .
john , london , uk i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair jon murtagh , lincoln i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair .
he did n't look best pleased , but had to grin and bear it , whilst handing over a £ 1 to the swear box .
jon murtagh , lincoln , uk in my office we are having office e-mail bingo , a football tournament , a team quiz , office olympics and numerous other fundraising events in addition to dressing up .
it 's one day of the year when raising money for charity also really raises a smile -lrb- even a giggle at the sight of your colleagues in a red wig , t-shirt and nose -rrb- .
rowan , livingston , scotland i work for royal mail and they are allowing me to dress up as elvis , -lrb- white cat suit , wig , glasses , etc -rrb- .
i will be delivering the mail on a stretch of chiswick high road .
vinny o 'connor , chiswick , london w4 after my shift at work i will be joining many colleagues from the call centre i work at in durham .
we will be taking the pledges from viewers of comic relief - we are all volunteering until 2am so dig deep ! ! !
julie , tyne & wear i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues dominique guyot , bristol , uk i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues .
a qualified hairdresser has agreed to come and do it .
i 've managed to raise £ 300 in sponsorship money from friends and colleagues .
i do n't normally wear my hair short , let alone none at all !
dominique guyot , bristol , uk red nose day is a fantastic day !
it puts all problems into perspective , when you see the courage and bravery of people who go through so much with so little .
i do not understand how people can not donate to such a deserving cause .
naomi sharman , leeds most people at our work are not bothering to participate in our dressing up day but there 's a few red-haired people with their clothes on back to front , one person in pyjamas and a few red noses around .
david hilton , hudds , uk when i hear some of the comments on these pages , i feel ashamed to be british -lrb- and i 'm a very patriotic person -rrb- .
i 've just donated £ 100 on your behalf to make up for the moaning .
davu , buck i will be doing absolutely nothing , and refusing to pay for our dress-down day at work .
i will decide when i am going to donate to charity , and no-one is going to get money out of me any other way .
in fact , events like red nose day just force me to tighten the purse strings even more !
andy , leeds , uk my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day ian child , orpington , kent i have just finished reading the comments on this website and ca n't believe that there are people in this country that do n't care or are just not interested .
my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day .
ian child , orpington , kent all my work colleagues are dressed in red , buying wonderful home-made cakes , contributing financially .
in a very busy environment people are much more smiley and relaxed .
it does wonders for team working too !
jan , brighton as it 's red nose day i 've taken the day off work , as i do every red nose or children in need day .
why ?
because i refuse to pay £ 1 for a piddly slice of cake and being made to feel guilty if i do n't buy a piece .
red nose day is lame ...
it 's cringe worthy and embarrassing .
gemma , surrey we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london i work in a large london office , there is no indication whatsoever that this is red nose day .
nothing is red , nobody has dressed up , there are no special cakes and no collection box of any kind .
it 's not because anyone has banned it , it 's never been mentioned .
we 're all too busy doing our work ...
we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london , england nothing .
i fear that every time the nation gives to charity mr brown takes note , then he knows how much he can squeeze out of us with stealth taxes .
robert , london , uk i can not believe the attitude of most of the people on here !
i agree that we need to think long term about poverty , which is why i give so much a month to christian aid .
but most people do n't give regularly .
comic relief raises millions every year , of course that does some good !
caroline , oldham after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness catherine o , maidenhead , uk if these comments really do reflect the balance of public opinion , they paint a pretty depressing picture of british attitudes .
like many people , i make regular donations to good causes and do n't usually give to tv appeals but after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness .
catherine o , maidenhead , uk our school is very charity minded , we have kids and staff in all red , male staff in drag , sponsored walkers , dancers and silences ... you name it !
it 's a festival for a good cause !
vicki , london here in the cosmetics team at boots hq , the fellas in the team have agreed to a ' make-over ' if us girls raise £ 100 -lrb- well on our way -rrb- .
lipsticks , blush and nail polish at the ready !
lisa , notts , england well i 'm sitting typing this at work in my pyjamas .
i am the charity co-ordinator at my work and we always get so much from our colleagues !
i think that if we have things and other people do n't then we should help them out .
red nose day does n't come every year , so give as much as you can that 's what i say .
sara , aberdeen , scotland we have gone mad at work this year .
while most of us ca n't get away with wearing daft costumes , we are wearing red , but there are some cross-dressers kicking about , a bake-off , mad hair , mad clothes and everyone is giving their hard earned money with a really big smile on their faces .
even the " boring " ones have been persuaded to join in !
long live red nose day !
claire , chesterfield , uk we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour benedict taylor , long eaton , uk at trent college in long eaton my boarding house are doing a sponsored hymnathon .
we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour .
so far it looks as though we get around £ 250 for comic relief .
benedict taylor , long eaton , uk ignoring it .
this charity fest supports causes that are , in my opinion , not worthy target your giving and make sure it goes where its needed .
freddy , uk how can these people who claim to be ' charited out ' sleep at night ?
i believe if you can not put your hands in your pockets a couple of times a year in order to give to people less fortunate than your selves , then you live in a very cynical and selfish world .
most of us in the uk are privileged to lead comfortable lives , if you can not be bothered to support those who have the tenacity and courage to say " no this is not right , we can do something to help these people " then shame on you .
danny - yorkshire , goole uk i have baked some red nose biscuits , and am selling them for a minimum of 20p each , but hoping that people will donate more .
gina saunders , oxford , uk i 'm doing " sponsor a pigtail " at work !
for every donation of 50p i get from a colleague , i put an extra pigtail in my hair .
unfortunately it 's going down so well that my arms are aching , but it 's worth it to fill my little collecting box .
sarah b , york , uk i give by direct debit to 3 smaller charities every month -lrb- for the last 5 years -rrb- so i am no scrooge .
however , i find my self unimpressed and unmoved by the emotional blackmail tactics used on tv .
i also deplore the idealistic ' making poverty history ' claims -lrb- it ai n't gonna happen far to pie in the sky ! -rrb-
i will not watch the ego fest that is comic relief ; i am tired of seeing talent less publicity seeking so called ' celebs ' embarrassing attempts to " entertain " .
if they really cared , they just donate and save us the embarrassment .
i would rather give my hard earned cash to help charities of my choice in this country .
meg , grantham lincs sorry , has victor meldrew hijacked this forum as a fundraising gag ? - that 's the impression i 'm getting from all the whingeing and self-righteous comments on here !
but no , unfortunately the comments are genuine , and very disappointing .
i for one will be donating tonight and enjoying the entertainment , which hopefully will restore my faith .
long live comic relief !
mary , gloucester , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day -lrb- with red sauce -rrb- , we are wearing something red and for the afternoon we have strawberries and cream , mmmm .
the diet starts monday , after all it 's for charity !
elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk in our fish and chip shop we 've all contributed in wearing the red nose day t-shirts , spraying our hair red and going wild on the make up .
we all look so funny away from the boring uniform we all usually wear .
maria , kidderminster , uk the staff at british gas in leeds are taking phone pledges this evening until midnight .
stacey kerrigan , leeds , uk sprayed my three children 's ' hair red , spiked my hair and sprayed it red , bought them a red nose each , put money in the bucket at my sons school , think i 've done my bit for comic relief .
al , milton keynes , uk our college -lrb- sfx college , clapham -rrb- are doing a variety of events -lrb- which have been happening this week -rrb- held by our student council , this includes dressing up in your old school uniform , competitions and selling fair trade products , including drinks and food , they will also be selling the white wrists bands to promote making poverty history .
our college is hoping that we as a college community will raise lots of money for a great cause !
mel , london i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we are having a raffle with donated gifts -lrb- mostly alcohol ! -rrb- from staff , we have the red nose scratch and match and are selling cakes , etc which people kindly brought in .
we also have staff with red hair and one with not so much hair , so big red dots on his head !
i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we raised £ 250 last week holding a cake sale in the biological sciences department at the university of liverpool .
everyone was so generous , with some people paying up to £ 10 for 1 cake !
the microbiology department , liverpool , uk after a hectic morning of red hair dyes , face paint and frantic scrabbling for red clothes - i 've taken the children to school -lrb- non-uniform day , with lots of stalls to raise more money -rrb- , with a pocket full of change each and will now spend the day cleaning the house , so that tonight i can settle down with the family and watch some entertainment on tv !
i will probably end up crying my eyes out - and donating more money than i can afford - but hey !
that 's what comic relief is all about !
jb , essex i 'm going to my uni lectures dressed as a giant bumblebee iona knight , exeter , devon it 's all very well to say that you give to a charity of your choice but the fact is that an event like red nose day mobilizes a lot of people to actually do something to raise cash and also awareness .
people can raise a lot of money at planned events and along with the noses , car accessories , stickers , ring tones , etc a huge amount is generated for the charities in question .
i 'm not really the sort of person who would put myself out there doing something " wacky " either but i can see why it 's a good thing that a lot of people do and i certainly would n't begrudge them my cash .
ann , scotland message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work liz wood , reading all the kids in our primary school brought £ 1 in today for the privilege of dressing up and having red hair .
they are also doing a talent show this afternoon .
my daughter bryony and her friend conor are doing a sponsored silence tomorrow .
all the proceeds will go to red nose day .
all great fun ways to raise money for a great cause .
message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work !
nyree dick , coaltown of balgonie , fife dressed up as fairy .
liz wood , reading i think the red noses are brilliant , but the sheer amount of tv coverage is rather ott in my opinion .
my place of work is n't doing anything for comic relief .
i work in the reception so have stuck my red nose on top of my monitor to brighten things up .
it was my birthday yesterday so tonight i shall be celebrating that by going out for a meal with friends .
helen , southampton , uk what will i be doing ?
looking for a red nose !
why on earth only restrict selling them to sainsbury and oxfam - then allow them to sell out in south wales ?
why not treat them like poppies and sell everywhere ?
okay - rant over - but if it was n't for the good will of an old friend , my 6-year-old lad would have felt very left out in school today - as others no doubt will .
please fix it next year .

today however if we make £ 100 plus i will run around the office wearing a dress / miniskirt ! !
graeme ellis , warwick today we are all dressed in red and are holding an afternoon tea of cucumber sandwiches and cakes for our colleagues . £ 2.50 each to attend , so social too .
lots of takers .
sarah k , cambridge sponsorship going well stu maddison , west london dressed as a sunderland footballer for the day , complete with flatcap and ne accent .
my legs have attracted comment and the quality of my accent has varied .
i 'm from hants , but have ne blood and got my degree up there .
sponsorship going well .
stu maddison , west london as someone who 's been involved in charity fundraising and voluntary work for years i 've read the other comments with a mixture of horror and anger .
let 's just remember that the key thing about charitably fundraising is that you give freely and willingly .
there 's no " feel guilty " about most of the collectors out there .
they 're doing something positive and you 're just being asked to support that .
as for the " self-serving actor " rubbish .
do me a favour wake up to yourselves .
sure there are a couple like that but the majority do it because they 're in a position to do something positive .
i 've seen that commitment up close and personal .

i have made choccie buns and truffles for people to donate to eat and we did the red nose day sweepstake !
leanne , cornwall it 's a real good fun atmosphere hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset i work for the local government and all 900 people in the building have been giving me money for comic relief .
it 's a real good fun atmosphere in here today and i reckon we will break £ 1000 by next week ! !
hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset we are donating the fares from one tram to comic relief - which could be up to £ 5,000 !
the chosen tram will be decorated with posters highlighting it as the ' red nose day tram ' .
nottingham 's trams , nottingham , uk the staff at highways agency office in birmingham are seeing red and losing their heads ! !
several sponsored events include dressing as a clown , shaving half of a beard off and having a very dodgy red mullet-do ! !
also tea and cake sales have been arranged for this lunchtime and most people are wearing red items of clothing and donating a £ 1 to support comic relief .
laura , birmingham we here at bt parkside in coventry are preparing to man some of the donation lines for tonight 's pledges ... wish us luck .
sarah 's team , coventry , uk at 11 o 'clock on friday 11th we just waxed 11 legs from 6 volunteers .
they were all men and screamed like babies .
sarah lewendon , basingstoke a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard dave love , kesgrave , england a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard - and he looks a bit like a lady !
he looks great sitting in an open plan office .
dave love , kesgrave , england i shall be watching it and lending it my moral support .
i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i think it 's more important that people take the opportunity to contribute regularly to a charity or two throughout the year rather than give sporadically .
set up a direct debit to a charity for as little as a couple of pounds a month and everyone wins .
you feel good , the charity gets the money it needs .
the only drawback is that there would be no need for shows like tonight 's comic relief !
mo c , uk today we 're holding a raffle with prizes donated by the bosses ; dressing down in denim and red -lrb- quite brave for a solicitors ' office ! -rrb- and having an auction for a fast boat trip .
we 'll probably only raise about £ 300 but every penny helps .
bearing in mind that people have given generously to the tsunami appeal , we 'll be happy about any amount we raise .
sue , southampton , uk to those who rattle their tins and dress in ridiculous costumes and try to make me feel guilty for not joining in the " fun " : you 've no idea whether i give up my evenings and weekends to work in a homeless shelter ; you do n't know that i 'm not an activist for amnesty international ; you have n't a clue what charities i support with tax-efficient , gift-aided standing orders .
this may be one day for you , but please do n't judge everyone by your standards and assume the stony-faced people who are avoiding you are uncharitable .
some of them are just fed up with the patronising and accusing judgements .
anon i was on a tall ships youth trust square rig sailing ship -lrb- stavros s niarchos -rrb- in the canaries last week and i climbed to the top of the 45 metre mast to raise money for comic relief .
i have raised over £ 750 so far from sponsors where i work - boden - and from fellow crew members on the ship .
pete lemon , great hampden , uk i am being sponsored to be silent in the office all day !
it 's going to be a tough job with the crazy crew i work with ! !
robert , london the cardiff and vale of glamorgan scout network will be joining other scouts from the area to virtually row , run and cycle the distance from cardiff to london between 16:30 - 18:30 today outside debenhams in st david 's arcade , cardiff .
please come and support us if you are in the city centre .
gareth , cardiff , wales i will be manning the donation lines for the night dan tremain , bromley as i work for one of the big companies that are allegedly hijacking comic relief to boost sales i will be manning the donation lines for the night .
dan tremain , bromley i am amazed that some people are writing in saying that they are ' charitied out ' .
i agree that we ca n't all keep giving to all the good causes out there , but that does n't mean we have to lose our compassion for those less fortunate both at home and abroad .
for the sake of £ 1 for a red nose -lrb- whether you wear it or not -rrb- you can add that little drop to the ocean .
if everyone in the uk bought a £ 1 red nose - it would raise £ 55 million - and that would go a very , very long way ...
clare , scotland a couple of teams from within our youth football club staged an rnd benefit match last weekend and raised £ 78 .
we hope to top that up towards the end of the month when we are staging a second benefit game for the red nose cause .
chris cox , fawley falcons youth f.c , southampton , uk the snide and selfish attitudes expressed by many here will be enough to make me take part .
peter , birmingham so far we have raised over £ 200 jo , birmingham my company is having a dress down day .
so far we have raised over £ 200 .
i can not believe some of these comments .
i would like to think that if the table was turned , africa would help us out .
i realise that people have probably given to the tsunami appeal , but africa still needs our help , as do the hundreds of charities in the uk who benefit .
stop being such kill joys ! !
jo , birmingham red clothes , red lipstick , red hair - cakes , quizzes and fun !
fiona , tina , cath , jill and louise , dundee , uk severn trent telephone room girls have brought jelly beans , put them into a pot and the other employees have to guess how many to win a bottle of bubbly .
we are also doing the sweepstake , of course wearing red noses and red hair .
mel halligan , birmingham , england well what happened to good old fashioned humour ?
i turned up for work in a spacesuit for red nose day , only to be told by my boss to ' sort myself out ' .
it 's no wonder so many people have stress related sick days .
tony , derby 4 of us are wearing wigs and generally having a laugh .
julie , glasgow , scotland i 've got the red gel in my hair , face paint on my face and my red nose hanging round my neck - and a big comic relief bucket by my desk for donations !
anj , reading in hbos financial services in leeds we have a tombola , cake stall , red nose cake raffle -lrb- i 've made a cake that looks like a nose ! -rrb- and quiz sheets , plus fining anyone not wearing red !
jane robson , leeds , england making cakes , red nose day sweepstake , and dressing up all red .
hope to give everyone a laugh or a stomach cramp after eating my cakes .
anyway , hope to add my small collection to the larger pot !
happy red nose day .
hannah , bedfordshire coming from the states , where the most organised charity appeal is the rather pathetic jerry lewis telethon , red nose day is a real treat and a great way to get people involved in giving to those less fortunate .
my daughter 's school has a full day of activities planned and i 've sent her off with a sack of pound coins to give away .
as for me , i 'll hitch my red nose to my bike basket and later this evening , tune into fame academy .
lisa , cambridge hopefully we can do our bit sandy , cambridgeshire the vets and nurses at the broadway vet hospital are wearing pyjamas and dressing gowns for the day - and it 's cold .
hopefully we can do our bit , we have our mascot molly the terrier here as well .
sandy , cambridgeshire my son 's school is getting them all to come in dressed in something red , and he 's got a mad ' barnett ' for the day too .
he 's been so excited about wearing this all week , i thought we 'd never get to friday !
fair play to the headmaster , he 's always up for anything which helps the children to get a perspective on the real world , and let 's face it the world is bonkers !
eoin , cornwall , uk please try to sell red noses etc through more outlets next time .
we do not have a sainsbury or oxfam shop locally and when i tried to buy goods over the net they were all sold out .
sue sorrell , blackburn , england our office for the first time ever celebrated red nose day and the girls made rolls and bacon and rolls and sausage - total £ 80 .
not bad for a small office .
lisa , uk i am sporting a ridiculously red hairstyle at work today and charging people for singing them a song .
so far we 've raised over £ 60 .
whooppee !
alison , broadstairs , uk myself and my colleagues are taking phone pledges until midnight .
mark , leeds , uk some people 's attitudes stink !
especially those who claim we should n't give money abroad .
they 're human too !
and besides , money goes to the uk too - get your facts right before posting !
ross , halesowen , uk two of my work colleagues - nicola and alex have cooked us all sausage and bacon sandwiches for breakfast and are doing the same for lunch !
we are all donating generously !
sophie cope , godalming , surrey our colleague bob gould is having his beard shaved off after 20 years and has raised £ 450 .
sheila evans , sevenoaks , kent , uk dye your hair , have a laugh lesley smart , carluke , scotland what an absolute joy it was in our house this morning , as my two sons , aged 4 and 11 , got ready for school / nursery , with their red hair spray , red clothes and red noses , having such fun but thinking of others .
yes we do have a lot of charities looking for our support , but is n't this a fun way of helping others .
go on dye your hair , have a laugh , at least we in this country are free to do these things if we wish .
lesley smart , carluke , scotland i bought the little britain dvd and have donated some money for cakes that someone 's kindly brought in !
paul , milton keynes we 're doing hair spraying , head shaving , and running a mega raffle with prizes including : win a mini for a week .
nottingham panthers players coming down at 1pm .
the cornerhouse in nottingham , nottingham , england it 's one day of the year that we should all support martin , brighton , uk i can not believe the attitude of some people .
it may be a little bit wacky but it 's one day of the year that we should all support , from our nice warm homes .
martin , brighton , uk comic relief would be great if only my school would allow us to do something .
we are not allowed to dye our hair red or put face paint on or even wear non-uniform .
louisa , reading , uk for me , comic relief has been hijacked by big retail companies who are more interested in boosting sales than donating to charities , and if the tv coverage follows the style of recent years it will be 80 % embarrassing , 10 % guilt and 10 % watchable entertainment .
jon dalladay , london , uk holding the ' great red nose bake-off ' .
talented colleagues bake cakes and every one pays £ 1 to eat them and vote on the best .
a great excuse to eat cake on a friday afternoon .
kirsten , glasgow i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i 'm fed up of red nose day and children in need and their ilk .
i give to various charities on a regular basis .
i do n't need what is essentially lazy television scheduling to try to persuade me to give more .
ian , leeds i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume rs , glasgow uk i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume and trying to make miserable old scrooges realise that living in one of the richest countries in the world carries responsibilities to ones fellow man .
oh , and making people feel guilty too .
rs , glasgow uk how much do we need to donate to keep ruby wax and robbie williams off our tvs ?
philippe , london , uk colouring my hair red , putting on a nose and a big smile and waiting for little britain 's comic relief special !
christine , uk while people may be tired of red nose day -lrb- and i am too , in fact i was never into it when it first came out -rrb- , i am dismayed at some of the comments here .
i may not like red nose day , but i do enjoy giving and helping out groups and charities of my choice , i am certainly not all charitied out .
the voluntary sector makes a massive difference to peoples lives locally , nationally and internationally and these hard working charities need out support .
if all charities were to disappear tomorrow we would soon know about it and the world would be much worse place .
it 's very easy to moan about giving from the comfort of your own laptop , having had the luck to be born in the west .
some people at my university are selling cookies for red nose day tomorrow , i will buy some of those and offload my small change to anyone with a collection box , it all helps .
i am glad that at least some people here are going all out in their fund raising efforts and wish them all the best , it 's good to see some charity and community spirit exists around here .
amy , colchester they should do what they did the other year .
every hour they picked someone who donated on the phone and they won vip tickets to a football match .
i feel more people would give if they felt they had a chance of winning something .
chris h , lincoln i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it alex young , grantham , lincs i 'm doing nothing .
i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it .
children in need should give it a rest for a few years .
it 's not that i 'm not a giving person , i give money to the odd charity now and then .
there should be a rnli day that is a charity that really needs the public donations .
alex young , grantham , lincs we have finally managed to persuade our school to have a non uniform day , and several people are shaving their hair off .
unfortunately , there does n't seem to be any red noses around where i live , otherwise i 'd buy one .
emily , cumbria , uk what am i doing ?
absolutely nothing .
i have charity fatigue and resent other people trying to make me feel guilty for not joining in days and days of begging by tin-rattlers , topped off by hours of unfunny ' comedy ' sketches .
if i want to give to charity , i will .
in my own time and not because it is pc to do so .
i hesitate to mention this as discretion is the better part of valour , but i do voluntary work , i just do n't feel the need to advertise the details of my deeds -lrb- or donations -rrb- on television .
nichola feeney , dundee , scotland i have decided to boycott comic relief this year and donate my money to other charities instead .
it was not a decision i made lightly , but the fact that this year 's theme is the same as last year 's , and the general coverage , has persuaded me that all anyone cares about anymore is celebrities mucking around in funny hairdos .
actually helping the disadvantaged seems like some sort of side issue .
r potter , cambridge , uk this time red nose will get nothing from me bumble , dartford , uk with so many charities chasing donation 's , is it little wonder that sooner or later we will all get charity fatigue .
so this time red nose will get nothing from me .
bumble , dartford , uk i will be out celebrating my birthday - probably wearing nothing but a hairy red nose !
rachel , ipswich , uk anyone see the episode of the office where they have red nose day ?
i am with tim - work 's idea of " wackiness " does n't really do it for me , but i will donate .
fraser , essex , england i will give some money and then go out instead of watching self-publicising celebrities prance about on tv .
it seems a coincidence to me that they 're so happy to give up their time when they have a book / musical / tv show to promote .
julie , brighton , england when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term paul , london i 'll be writing to my mp demanding that gordon brown keeps to his commitments to long term aid for the third world .
sorry to be a misery but comic relief money is a drop in the ocean and i find something obscene in multi-million salaried celebrities showing footage of starving children whilst being happy and nice and we all feel guilty , give some cash , pat ourselves on the back and feel like generally nice folk .
please people , when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term - comic relief will solve them for a fraction of the sufferers for a day .
paul , london ignoring it completely .
i give to the charities of my choice , not the charities i 'm told to give to by celebrities who " give their time for free " -lrb- read : gain some free self-publicity and tell me to open my wallet without opening their own -rrb- john b , uk money from appeals like this is sent to these people in order to help themselves -lrb- the presenters take great pains in telling us that all they want is to help themselves -rrb- .
the question is " why are these people still in need of such help after 20 years of red nose day ? " .
if this is all they want , i find it hard to believe that it would take 20 years .
i heard billy connolly try to shame us into believing that " compassion fatigue " is a myth , but after 20 years of donating and seeing no change in their situation , it is indeed a very real thing !
paul , nottingham , uk red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off william read , staffordshire nothing .
it is well past its sell by date , and the sooner it is put out of its misery the better .
red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off .
william read , stafford , staffordshire maybe i 'm selfish , but i do n't see the point in donating money abroad when we have our own problems to deal with , such as homelessness on our streets .
this has been going on for 20 years yet the same problems still exist abroad , i do n't think throwing some cash at them every year will ever solve it .
ed , ayrshire i have already done my bit by donating .
on the night i will be avoiding the tv screen at all costs .
the very thought of watching more than two minutes of ' comedians ' lenny henry , liza tarbuck and dawn french brings me out in hives .
leon , brighouse , uk will the public dig deep again ?
maybe the tsunami appeal has taken the country 's generosity ! come on people africa needs aid too !
dean chambers , castleford , uk the same as every year - buying a bottle of wine and watching films .
whilst i support charity , i want to choose those i support and do not want it rammed down my throat .
carolyn , england sorry , but i 'm all charity 'd out and wo n't watching or donating this year .
j , oxford it has created a real buzz around the office kiltie , staffs , uk we have managed to persuade our very staid company to allow us to have a fancy dress fun day .
we are having a fete theme with tombola stall , name the elephant , raffle , guess the babies plus prizes for the best and worst outfits .
staff are also doing their own little bits - ie two ladies are dressing as saloon girls and if they raise fifty pounds by 1pm they will go to tesco 's in their outfits to buy their lunch !
it has created a real buzz around the office and has been the only topic of conversation all day .
we ca n't wait ! ! !
kiltie , staffs , uk i wo n't be doing anything for red nose day as my work is relocating the following day and we have to pack away last minute things and help the removal men .
as for watching it , i find it the most pointless 6/7 hours and would rather be playing board games .
charity does not need blanket tv coverage .
by the way i have donated £ 10 to comic relief .
helen , leeds what will i be doing ?
doing my best to avoid aggressive tin-rattlers dressed in ridiculous costumes who will be doing their best to make me feel guilty , and failing miserably .
trevor , cambs , uk our office is going all out for red nose day , from sponsoring members of staff to dress up as cartoon characters to spot the red hairdo on our intranet .
not everyone is taking an active part , but everyone is giving something .
if everyone was a moany old skinflint like trevor there would n't be anyone left alive in third world countries !
cheer up it 's for a good cause !
kelly , edinburgh , scotland absolutely nothing apart from trying to avoid the irritating tin shakers on my way home in the evening .
i give to the charities i choose to , not the ones that have big enough budgets to try and guilt trip people into giving them money with footage of starving orphans .

your comments : i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " sass , somerset the school where i work has organised a strictly come dancing contest where the children are teaching teams of staff to perform dance routines and then children pay to vote for the winners .
i spent comic relief night in front of the telly , wildly fluctuating between laughter and tears watching the film cameos from africa - it makes you realise what a rich life we all are privileged to live here , when it takes so little to make others in desperate need so happy .
i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " - such a happy song and a simple but effective video .
hope it gets to number one !
i 'm happy to give time and money to causes like this , long may it continue .
sass , somerset well i spent the night working on the donation line - having been semi dragged into helping by a friend of mine .
i was incredibly glad she did do so - we only meant to stay till 10pm , but were still going when our call centre ran out of forms at 1.30am.
it was a brilliant and humbling experience .
people donated what they could from a few pounds to a thousand plus and the atmosphere was great .
completely different from my day job , but my way of helping comic relief - i could donate little so was glad to help where i could .
roz , bradford , uk we sponsored our good mate emma to dress as barbie for a full day of college .
she raised over £ 120 - well done girly : d becca , birmingham just donated - if i have to go without a few pints because a day which reminds us all how lucky we are and how unfortunate some are asks me to then that 's fine .
we all have a responsibility since it is in no small part the imposition of a particular western brand of economic capitalism on many nations which has left them playing catch-up .
evan , edinburgh people giving what they could afford stuart , cleethorpes , uk i was on the donation line last night and was completely humbled by all those who pledged , from a few pounds to a few hundred .
the amount did n't matter , it was people giving what they could afford .
to all those humbugs out there , i 'm sorry you will never know the pleasure of speaking to every single fantastic person who phoned us last night .
stuart , cleethorpes , uk two 6 year olds from west derby liverpool , rosa and scarlett made and sold red nose cakes and raised £ 40 for red nose day .

the leaf division sold red noses , and it was lots of fun .
i had my hair dyed red and i wore a suit .
simon chan , taunton , somerset staff and children of little rainbows day nursery wore wigs , red noses and dressed in colours of the rainbow .
the children have been busy making and selling badges , selling the red noses , staff and parents having a go on the official sweepstake and finally bringing into nursery lots of pennies to make a " mile of pennies " .
in total we raised £ 191.33 sandra wheeler , barrow-in-furness , cumbria , england it 's 3am and we 've just got in from " work " !

helen and iain , telford , shropshire i dressed as elvis and sang loudly at the unsuspecting public in bath , making over 500 pounds over the day !
me and many other members of university rags raised tens of thousands in street collections and silly stunts across the country .
huseyin , bath , uk ca n't believe some people on here are moaning about red nose day ...
my kids were up early this morning for red hair colour and no uniform at school .

long may it continue .
john , london , uk i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair jon murtagh , lincoln i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair .
he did n't look best pleased , but had to grin and bear it , whilst handing over a £ 1 to the swear box .
jon murtagh , lincoln , uk in my office we are having office e-mail bingo , a football tournament , a team quiz , office olympics and numerous other fundraising events in addition to dressing up .
it 's one day of the year when raising money for charity also really raises a smile -lrb- even a giggle at the sight of your colleagues in a red wig , t-shirt and nose -rrb- .
rowan , livingston , scotland i work for royal mail and they are allowing me to dress up as elvis , -lrb- white cat suit , wig , glasses , etc -rrb- .
i will be delivering the mail on a stretch of chiswick high road .
vinny o 'connor , chiswick , london w4 after my shift at work i will be joining many colleagues from the call centre i work at in durham .
we will be taking the pledges from viewers of comic relief - we are all volunteering until 2am so dig deep ! ! !
julie , tyne & wear i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues dominique guyot , bristol , uk i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues .
a qualified hairdresser has agreed to come and do it .
i 've managed to raise £ 300 in sponsorship money from friends and colleagues .
i do n't normally wear my hair short , let alone none at all !
dominique guyot , bristol , uk red nose day is a fantastic day !
it puts all problems into perspective , when you see the courage and bravery of people who go through so much with so little .
i do not understand how people can not donate to such a deserving cause .
naomi sharman , leeds most people at our work are not bothering to participate in our dressing up day but there 's a few red-haired people with their clothes on back to front , one person in pyjamas and a few red noses around .
david hilton , hudds , uk when i hear some of the comments on these pages , i feel ashamed to be british -lrb- and i 'm a very patriotic person -rrb- .
i 've just donated £ 100 on your behalf to make up for the moaning .
davu , buck i will be doing absolutely nothing , and refusing to pay for our dress-down day at work .
i will decide when i am going to donate to charity , and no-one is going to get money out of me any other way .
in fact , events like red nose day just force me to tighten the purse strings even more !
andy , leeds , uk my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day ian child , orpington , kent i have just finished reading the comments on this website and ca n't believe that there are people in this country that do n't care or are just not interested .
my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day .
ian child , orpington , kent all my work colleagues are dressed in red , buying wonderful home-made cakes , contributing financially .
in a very busy environment people are much more smiley and relaxed .
it does wonders for team working too !
jan , brighton as it 's red nose day i 've taken the day off work , as i do every red nose or children in need day .
why ?
because i refuse to pay £ 1 for a piddly slice of cake and being made to feel guilty if i do n't buy a piece .
red nose day is lame ...
it 's cringe worthy and embarrassing .
gemma , surrey we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london i work in a large london office , there is no indication whatsoever that this is red nose day .
nothing is red , nobody has dressed up , there are no special cakes and no collection box of any kind .
it 's not because anyone has banned it , it 's never been mentioned .
we 're all too busy doing our work ...
we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london , england nothing .
i fear that every time the nation gives to charity mr brown takes note , then he knows how much he can squeeze out of us with stealth taxes .
robert , london , uk i can not believe the attitude of most of the people on here !
i agree that we need to think long term about poverty , which is why i give so much a month to christian aid .
but most people do n't give regularly .
comic relief raises millions every year , of course that does some good !
caroline , oldham after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness catherine o , maidenhead , uk if these comments really do reflect the balance of public opinion , they paint a pretty depressing picture of british attitudes .
like many people , i make regular donations to good causes and do n't usually give to tv appeals but after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness .
catherine o , maidenhead , uk our school is very charity minded , we have kids and staff in all red , male staff in drag , sponsored walkers , dancers and silences ... you name it !
it 's a festival for a good cause !
vicki , london here in the cosmetics team at boots hq , the fellas in the team have agreed to a ' make-over ' if us girls raise £ 100 -lrb- well on our way -rrb- .
lipsticks , blush and nail polish at the ready !
lisa , notts , england well i 'm sitting typing this at work in my pyjamas .
i am the charity co-ordinator at my work and we always get so much from our colleagues !
i think that if we have things and other people do n't then we should help them out .
red nose day does n't come every year , so give as much as you can that 's what i say .
sara , aberdeen , scotland we have gone mad at work this year .
while most of us ca n't get away with wearing daft costumes , we are wearing red , but there are some cross-dressers kicking about , a bake-off , mad hair , mad clothes and everyone is giving their hard earned money with a really big smile on their faces .
even the " boring " ones have been persuaded to join in !
long live red nose day !
claire , chesterfield , uk we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour benedict taylor , long eaton , uk at trent college in long eaton my boarding house are doing a sponsored hymnathon .
we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour .
so far it looks as though we get around £ 250 for comic relief .
benedict taylor , long eaton , uk ignoring it .
this charity fest supports causes that are , in my opinion , not worthy target your giving and make sure it goes where its needed .
freddy , uk how can these people who claim to be ' charited out ' sleep at night ?
i believe if you can not put your hands in your pockets a couple of times a year in order to give to people less fortunate than your selves , then you live in a very cynical and selfish world .
most of us in the uk are privileged to lead comfortable lives , if you can not be bothered to support those who have the tenacity and courage to say " no this is not right , we can do something to help these people " then shame on you .
danny - yorkshire , goole uk i have baked some red nose biscuits , and am selling them for a minimum of 20p each , but hoping that people will donate more .
gina saunders , oxford , uk i 'm doing " sponsor a pigtail " at work !
for every donation of 50p i get from a colleague , i put an extra pigtail in my hair .
unfortunately it 's going down so well that my arms are aching , but it 's worth it to fill my little collecting box .
sarah b , york , uk i give by direct debit to 3 smaller charities every month -lrb- for the last 5 years -rrb- so i am no scrooge .
however , i find my self unimpressed and unmoved by the emotional blackmail tactics used on tv .
i also deplore the idealistic ' making poverty history ' claims -lrb- it ai n't gonna happen far to pie in the sky ! -rrb-
i will not watch the ego fest that is comic relief ; i am tired of seeing talent less publicity seeking so called ' celebs ' embarrassing attempts to " entertain " .
if they really cared , they just donate and save us the embarrassment .
i would rather give my hard earned cash to help charities of my choice in this country .
meg , grantham lincs sorry , has victor meldrew hijacked this forum as a fundraising gag ? - that 's the impression i 'm getting from all the whingeing and self-righteous comments on here !
but no , unfortunately the comments are genuine , and very disappointing .
i for one will be donating tonight and enjoying the entertainment , which hopefully will restore my faith .
long live comic relief !
mary , gloucester , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day -lrb- with red sauce -rrb- , we are wearing something red and for the afternoon we have strawberries and cream , mmmm .
the diet starts monday , after all it 's for charity !
elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk in our fish and chip shop we 've all contributed in wearing the red nose day t-shirts , spraying our hair red and going wild on the make up .
we all look so funny away from the boring uniform we all usually wear .
maria , kidderminster , uk the staff at british gas in leeds are taking phone pledges this evening until midnight .
stacey kerrigan , leeds , uk sprayed my three children 's ' hair red , spiked my hair and sprayed it red , bought them a red nose each , put money in the bucket at my sons school , think i 've done my bit for comic relief .
al , milton keynes , uk our college -lrb- sfx college , clapham -rrb- are doing a variety of events -lrb- which have been happening this week -rrb- held by our student council , this includes dressing up in your old school uniform , competitions and selling fair trade products , including drinks and food , they will also be selling the white wrists bands to promote making poverty history .
our college is hoping that we as a college community will raise lots of money for a great cause !
mel , london i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we are having a raffle with donated gifts -lrb- mostly alcohol ! -rrb- from staff , we have the red nose scratch and match and are selling cakes , etc which people kindly brought in .
we also have staff with red hair and one with not so much hair , so big red dots on his head !
i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we raised £ 250 last week holding a cake sale in the biological sciences department at the university of liverpool .
everyone was so generous , with some people paying up to £ 10 for 1 cake !
the microbiology department , liverpool , uk after a hectic morning of red hair dyes , face paint and frantic scrabbling for red clothes - i 've taken the children to school -lrb- non-uniform day , with lots of stalls to raise more money -rrb- , with a pocket full of change each and will now spend the day cleaning the house , so that tonight i can settle down with the family and watch some entertainment on tv !
i will probably end up crying my eyes out - and donating more money than i can afford - but hey !
that 's what comic relief is all about !
jb , essex i 'm going to my uni lectures dressed as a giant bumblebee iona knight , exeter , devon it 's all very well to say that you give to a charity of your choice but the fact is that an event like red nose day mobilizes a lot of people to actually do something to raise cash and also awareness .
people can raise a lot of money at planned events and along with the noses , car accessories , stickers , ring tones , etc a huge amount is generated for the charities in question .
i 'm not really the sort of person who would put myself out there doing something " wacky " either but i can see why it 's a good thing that a lot of people do and i certainly would n't begrudge them my cash .
ann , scotland message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work liz wood , reading all the kids in our primary school brought £ 1 in today for the privilege of dressing up and having red hair .
they are also doing a talent show this afternoon .
my daughter bryony and her friend conor are doing a sponsored silence tomorrow .
all the proceeds will go to red nose day .
all great fun ways to raise money for a great cause .
message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work !
nyree dick , coaltown of balgonie , fife dressed up as fairy .
liz wood , reading i think the red noses are brilliant , but the sheer amount of tv coverage is rather ott in my opinion .
my place of work is n't doing anything for comic relief .
i work in the reception so have stuck my red nose on top of my monitor to brighten things up .
it was my birthday yesterday so tonight i shall be celebrating that by going out for a meal with friends .
helen , southampton , uk what will i be doing ?
looking for a red nose !
why on earth only restrict selling them to sainsbury and oxfam - then allow them to sell out in south wales ?
why not treat them like poppies and sell everywhere ?
okay - rant over - but if it was n't for the good will of an old friend , my 6-year-old lad would have felt very left out in school today - as others no doubt will .
please fix it next year .
tony , wales well i beeped my horn at aled from the chris moyles red nose rally this morning in plymouth .
and our little office raised £ 50 with the sweepstake and an easter egg raffle .
linda , mandy , carol , pj and the rest of the girls at serpells , plymouth i ca n't believe some of the miserable , selfish people on here !
talk about victor meldrow .

sally hampton , dundee , uk i will be with the rotary club of marlow thames , collecting a ' toll ' from cars crossing the thames over marlow bridge , as we have done before .
the traffic is at walking pace anyway during rush-hour , so we do n't delay anyone , and the great majority of people seem happy to have the chance to take part , and give cheerfully and generously .
michael cutler , marlow , bucks tony is singing everything he says !
steph dodwell , chelmsford i work at anglia polytechnic university as an administrator .

becks , london we have dressed up one of our reporters at the wiltshire times in red nose kit .
i think it is vital for local newspapers to get in the mood and encourage the thousands of people who are making an effort to raise money for such a worthwhile cause .
craig evry , trowbridge , uk we 're a small elite company of structural and civil engineers with big hearts and the boss suggested we come in school uniform .

sarah k , cambridge sponsorship going well stu maddison , west london dressed as a sunderland footballer for the day , complete with flatcap and ne accent .
my legs have attracted comment and the quality of my accent has varied .
i 'm from hants , but have ne blood and got my degree up there .
sponsorship going well .
stu maddison , west london as someone who 's been involved in charity fundraising and voluntary work for years i 've read the other comments with a mixture of horror and anger .
let 's just remember that the key thing about charitably fundraising is that you give freely and willingly .
there 's no " feel guilty " about most of the collectors out there .
they 're doing something positive and you 're just being asked to support that .
as for the " self-serving actor " rubbish .
do me a favour wake up to yourselves .
sure there are a couple like that but the majority do it because they 're in a position to do something positive .
i 've seen that commitment up close and personal .
martin , sheffield , uk i have been wearing my red nose all day in work .

it 's a real good fun atmosphere in here today and i reckon we will break £ 1000 by next week ! !
hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset we are donating the fares from one tram to comic relief - which could be up to £ 5,000 !
the chosen tram will be decorated with posters highlighting it as the ' red nose day tram ' .
nottingham 's trams , nottingham , uk the staff at highways agency office in birmingham are seeing red and losing their heads ! !

sarah lewendon , basingstoke a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard dave love , kesgrave , england a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard - and he looks a bit like a lady !
he looks great sitting in an open plan office .
dave love , kesgrave , england i shall be watching it and lending it my moral support .
i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i think it 's more important that people take the opportunity to contribute regularly to a charity or two throughout the year rather than give sporadically .
set up a direct debit to a charity for as little as a couple of pounds a month and everyone wins .
you feel good , the charity gets the money it needs .
the only drawback is that there would be no need for shows like tonight 's comic relief !
mo c , uk today we 're holding a raffle with prizes donated by the bosses ; dressing down in denim and red -lrb- quite brave for a solicitors ' office ! -rrb- and having an auction for a fast boat trip .
we 'll probably only raise about £ 300 but every penny helps .
bearing in mind that people have given generously to the tsunami appeal , we 'll be happy about any amount we raise .
sue , southampton , uk to those who rattle their tins and dress in ridiculous costumes and try to make me feel guilty for not joining in the " fun " : you 've no idea whether i give up my evenings and weekends to work in a homeless shelter ; you do n't know that i 'm not an activist for amnesty international ; you have n't a clue what charities i support with tax-efficient , gift-aided standing orders .
this may be one day for you , but please do n't judge everyone by your standards and assume the stony-faced people who are avoiding you are uncharitable .
some of them are just fed up with the patronising and accusing judgements .
anon i was on a tall ships youth trust square rig sailing ship -lrb- stavros s niarchos -rrb- in the canaries last week and i climbed to the top of the 45 metre mast to raise money for comic relief .

gareth , cardiff , wales i will be manning the donation lines for the night dan tremain , bromley as i work for one of the big companies that are allegedly hijacking comic relief to boost sales i will be manning the donation lines for the night .
dan tremain , bromley i am amazed that some people are writing in saying that they are ' charitied out ' .
i agree that we ca n't all keep giving to all the good causes out there , but that does n't mean we have to lose our compassion for those less fortunate both at home and abroad .
for the sake of £ 1 for a red nose -lrb- whether you wear it or not -rrb- you can add that little drop to the ocean .
if everyone in the uk bought a £ 1 red nose - it would raise £ 55 million - and that would go a very , very long way ...
clare , scotland a couple of teams from within our youth football club staged an rnd benefit match last weekend and raised £ 78 .
we hope to top that up towards the end of the month when we are staging a second benefit game for the red nose cause .
chris cox , fawley falcons youth f.c , southampton , uk the snide and selfish attitudes expressed by many here will be enough to make me take part .
peter , birmingham so far we have raised over £ 200 jo , birmingham my company is having a dress down day .
so far we have raised over £ 200 .
i can not believe some of these comments .
i would like to think that if the table was turned , africa would help us out .
i realise that people have probably given to the tsunami appeal , but africa still needs our help , as do the hundreds of charities in the uk who benefit .
stop being such kill joys ! !
jo , birmingham red clothes , red lipstick , red hair - cakes , quizzes and fun !
fiona , tina , cath , jill and louise , dundee , uk severn trent telephone room girls have brought jelly beans , put them into a pot and the other employees have to guess how many to win a bottle of bubbly .
we are also doing the sweepstake , of course wearing red noses and red hair .
mel halligan , birmingham , england well what happened to good old fashioned humour ?
i turned up for work in a spacesuit for red nose day , only to be told by my boss to ' sort myself out ' .
it 's no wonder so many people have stress related sick days .
tony , derby 4 of us are wearing wigs and generally having a laugh .
julie , glasgow , scotland i 've got the red gel in my hair , face paint on my face and my red nose hanging round my neck - and a big comic relief bucket by my desk for donations !

jane robson , leeds , england making cakes , red nose day sweepstake , and dressing up all red .
hope to give everyone a laugh or a stomach cramp after eating my cakes .
anyway , hope to add my small collection to the larger pot !
happy red nose day .
hannah , bedfordshire coming from the states , where the most organised charity appeal is the rather pathetic jerry lewis telethon , red nose day is a real treat and a great way to get people involved in giving to those less fortunate .
my daughter 's school has a full day of activities planned and i 've sent her off with a sack of pound coins to give away .
as for me , i 'll hitch my red nose to my bike basket and later this evening , tune into fame academy .
lisa , cambridge hopefully we can do our bit sandy , cambridgeshire the vets and nurses at the broadway vet hospital are wearing pyjamas and dressing gowns for the day - and it 's cold .
hopefully we can do our bit , we have our mascot molly the terrier here as well .
sandy , cambridgeshire my son 's school is getting them all to come in dressed in something red , and he 's got a mad ' barnett ' for the day too .
he 's been so excited about wearing this all week , i thought we 'd never get to friday !
fair play to the headmaster , he 's always up for anything which helps the children to get a perspective on the real world , and let 's face it the world is bonkers !
eoin , cornwall , uk please try to sell red noses etc through more outlets next time .
we do not have a sainsbury or oxfam shop locally and when i tried to buy goods over the net they were all sold out .
sue sorrell , blackburn , england our office for the first time ever celebrated red nose day and the girls made rolls and bacon and rolls and sausage - total £ 80 .
not bad for a small office .
lisa , uk i am sporting a ridiculously red hairstyle at work today and charging people for singing them a song .
so far we 've raised over £ 60 .
whooppee !
alison , broadstairs , uk myself and my colleagues are taking phone pledges until midnight .
mark , leeds , uk some people 's attitudes stink !
especially those who claim we should n't give money abroad .
they 're human too !
and besides , money goes to the uk too - get your facts right before posting !
ross , halesowen , uk two of my work colleagues - nicola and alex have cooked us all sausage and bacon sandwiches for breakfast and are doing the same for lunch !
we are all donating generously !

sheila evans , sevenoaks , kent , uk dye your hair , have a laugh lesley smart , carluke , scotland what an absolute joy it was in our house this morning , as my two sons , aged 4 and 11 , got ready for school / nursery , with their red hair spray , red clothes and red noses , having such fun but thinking of others .
yes we do have a lot of charities looking for our support , but is n't this a fun way of helping others .
go on dye your hair , have a laugh , at least we in this country are free to do these things if we wish .
lesley smart , carluke , scotland i bought the little britain dvd and have donated some money for cakes that someone 's kindly brought in !
paul , milton keynes we 're doing hair spraying , head shaving , and running a mega raffle with prizes including : win a mini for a week .
nottingham panthers players coming down at 1pm .
the cornerhouse in nottingham , nottingham , england it 's one day of the year that we should all support martin , brighton , uk i can not believe the attitude of some people .
it may be a little bit wacky but it 's one day of the year that we should all support , from our nice warm homes .
martin , brighton , uk comic relief would be great if only my school would allow us to do something .
we are not allowed to dye our hair red or put face paint on or even wear non-uniform .
louisa , reading , uk for me , comic relief has been hijacked by big retail companies who are more interested in boosting sales than donating to charities , and if the tv coverage follows the style of recent years it will be 80 % embarrassing , 10 % guilt and 10 % watchable entertainment .
jon dalladay , london , uk holding the ' great red nose bake-off ' .
talented colleagues bake cakes and every one pays £ 1 to eat them and vote on the best .
a great excuse to eat cake on a friday afternoon .
kirsten , glasgow i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i 'm fed up of red nose day and children in need and their ilk .
i give to various charities on a regular basis .
i do n't need what is essentially lazy television scheduling to try to persuade me to give more .
ian , leeds i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume rs , glasgow uk i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume and trying to make miserable old scrooges realise that living in one of the richest countries in the world carries responsibilities to ones fellow man .
oh , and making people feel guilty too .
rs , glasgow uk how much do we need to donate to keep ruby wax and robbie williams off our tvs ?
philippe , london , uk colouring my hair red , putting on a nose and a big smile and waiting for little britain 's comic relief special !
christine , uk while people may be tired of red nose day -lrb- and i am too , in fact i was never into it when it first came out -rrb- , i am dismayed at some of the comments here .
i may not like red nose day , but i do enjoy giving and helping out groups and charities of my choice , i am certainly not all charitied out .
the voluntary sector makes a massive difference to peoples lives locally , nationally and internationally and these hard working charities need out support .
if all charities were to disappear tomorrow we would soon know about it and the world would be much worse place .
it 's very easy to moan about giving from the comfort of your own laptop , having had the luck to be born in the west .
some people at my university are selling cookies for red nose day tomorrow , i will buy some of those and offload my small change to anyone with a collection box , it all helps .
i am glad that at least some people here are going all out in their fund raising efforts and wish them all the best , it 's good to see some charity and community spirit exists around here .
amy , colchester they should do what they did the other year .
every hour they picked someone who donated on the phone and they won vip tickets to a football match .
i feel more people would give if they felt they had a chance of winning something .
chris h , lincoln i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it alex young , grantham , lincs i 'm doing nothing .
i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it .
children in need should give it a rest for a few years .
it 's not that i 'm not a giving person , i give money to the odd charity now and then .
there should be a rnli day that is a charity that really needs the public donations .
alex young , grantham , lincs we have finally managed to persuade our school to have a non uniform day , and several people are shaving their hair off .
unfortunately , there does n't seem to be any red noses around where i live , otherwise i 'd buy one .
emily , cumbria , uk what am i doing ?
absolutely nothing .
i have charity fatigue and resent other people trying to make me feel guilty for not joining in days and days of begging by tin-rattlers , topped off by hours of unfunny ' comedy ' sketches .
if i want to give to charity , i will .
in my own time and not because it is pc to do so .
i hesitate to mention this as discretion is the better part of valour , but i do voluntary work , i just do n't feel the need to advertise the details of my deeds -lrb- or donations -rrb- on television .
nichola feeney , dundee , scotland i have decided to boycott comic relief this year and donate my money to other charities instead .
it was not a decision i made lightly , but the fact that this year 's theme is the same as last year 's , and the general coverage , has persuaded me that all anyone cares about anymore is celebrities mucking around in funny hairdos .
actually helping the disadvantaged seems like some sort of side issue .
r potter , cambridge , uk this time red nose will get nothing from me bumble , dartford , uk with so many charities chasing donation 's , is it little wonder that sooner or later we will all get charity fatigue .
so this time red nose will get nothing from me .
bumble , dartford , uk i will be out celebrating my birthday - probably wearing nothing but a hairy red nose !
rachel , ipswich , uk anyone see the episode of the office where they have red nose day ?
i am with tim - work 's idea of " wackiness " does n't really do it for me , but i will donate .
fraser , essex , england i will give some money and then go out instead of watching self-publicising celebrities prance about on tv .
it seems a coincidence to me that they 're so happy to give up their time when they have a book / musical / tv show to promote .
julie , brighton , england when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term paul , london i 'll be writing to my mp demanding that gordon brown keeps to his commitments to long term aid for the third world .
sorry to be a misery but comic relief money is a drop in the ocean and i find something obscene in multi-million salaried celebrities showing footage of starving children whilst being happy and nice and we all feel guilty , give some cash , pat ourselves on the back and feel like generally nice folk .
please people , when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term - comic relief will solve them for a fraction of the sufferers for a day .
paul , london ignoring it completely .
i give to the charities of my choice , not the charities i 'm told to give to by celebrities who " give their time for free " -lrb- read : gain some free self-publicity and tell me to open my wallet without opening their own -rrb- john b , uk money from appeals like this is sent to these people in order to help themselves -lrb- the presenters take great pains in telling us that all they want is to help themselves -rrb- .
the question is " why are these people still in need of such help after 20 years of red nose day ? " .
if this is all they want , i find it hard to believe that it would take 20 years .
i heard billy connolly try to shame us into believing that " compassion fatigue " is a myth , but after 20 years of donating and seeing no change in their situation , it is indeed a very real thing !
paul , nottingham , uk red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off william read , staffordshire nothing .
it is well past its sell by date , and the sooner it is put out of its misery the better .
red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off .
william read , stafford , staffordshire maybe i 'm selfish , but i do n't see the point in donating money abroad when we have our own problems to deal with , such as homelessness on our streets .
this has been going on for 20 years yet the same problems still exist abroad , i do n't think throwing some cash at them every year will ever solve it .
ed , ayrshire i have already done my bit by donating .
on the night i will be avoiding the tv screen at all costs .
the very thought of watching more than two minutes of ' comedians ' lenny henry , liza tarbuck and dawn french brings me out in hives .
leon , brighouse , uk will the public dig deep again ?
maybe the tsunami appeal has taken the country 's generosity ! come on people africa needs aid too !
dean chambers , castleford , uk the same as every year - buying a bottle of wine and watching films .
whilst i support charity , i want to choose those i support and do not want it rammed down my throat .
carolyn , england sorry , but i 'm all charity 'd out and wo n't watching or donating this year .
j , oxford it has created a real buzz around the office kiltie , staffs , uk we have managed to persuade our very staid company to allow us to have a fancy dress fun day .
we are having a fete theme with tombola stall , name the elephant , raffle , guess the babies plus prizes for the best and worst outfits .
staff are also doing their own little bits - ie two ladies are dressing as saloon girls and if they raise fifty pounds by 1pm they will go to tesco 's in their outfits to buy their lunch !
it has created a real buzz around the office and has been the only topic of conversation all day .
we ca n't wait ! ! !
kiltie , staffs , uk i wo n't be doing anything for red nose day as my work is relocating the following day and we have to pack away last minute things and help the removal men .
as for watching it , i find it the most pointless 6/7 hours and would rather be playing board games .
charity does not need blanket tv coverage .
by the way i have donated £ 10 to comic relief .
helen , leeds what will i be doing ?
doing my best to avoid aggressive tin-rattlers dressed in ridiculous costumes who will be doing their best to make me feel guilty , and failing miserably .
trevor , cambs , uk our office is going all out for red nose day , from sponsoring members of staff to dress up as cartoon characters to spot the red hairdo on our intranet .
not everyone is taking an active part , but everyone is giving something .
if everyone was a moany old skinflint like trevor there would n't be anyone left alive in third world countries !
cheer up it 's for a good cause !
kelly , edinburgh , scotland absolutely nothing apart from trying to avoid the irritating tin shakers on my way home in the evening .
i give to the charities i choose to , not the ones that have big enough budgets to try and guilt trip people into giving them money with footage of starving orphans .

this year 's theme was " big hair and beyond " and it was also the twentieth anniversary of the charity which aims to tackle poverty and social injustice in the uk and africa .
comedians peter kay , dawn french , ricky gervais , lenny henry , ruby wax and liza tarbuck were among the stars who appeared on friday 's tv show on bbc 1 .
singers sir elton john , george michael and robbie williams also featured in little britain sketches broadcast during the seven-hour telethon .

your comments : i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " sass , somerset the school where i work has organised a strictly come dancing contest where the children are teaching teams of staff to perform dance routines and then children pay to vote for the winners .
i spent comic relief night in front of the telly , wildly fluctuating between laughter and tears watching the film cameos from africa - it makes you realise what a rich life we all are privileged to live here , when it takes so little to make others in desperate need so happy .
i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " - such a happy song and a simple but effective video .
hope it gets to number one !
i 'm happy to give time and money to causes like this , long may it continue .
sass , somerset well i spent the night working on the donation line - having been semi dragged into helping by a friend of mine .
i was incredibly glad she did do so - we only meant to stay till 10pm , but were still going when our call centre ran out of forms at 1.30am.
it was a brilliant and humbling experience .
people donated what they could from a few pounds to a thousand plus and the atmosphere was great .
completely different from my day job , but my way of helping comic relief - i could donate little so was glad to help where i could .
roz , bradford , uk we sponsored our good mate emma to dress as barbie for a full day of college .
she raised over £ 120 - well done girly : d becca , birmingham just donated - if i have to go without a few pints because a day which reminds us all how lucky we are and how unfortunate some are asks me to then that 's fine .
we all have a responsibility since it is in no small part the imposition of a particular western brand of economic capitalism on many nations which has left them playing catch-up .
evan , edinburgh people giving what they could afford stuart , cleethorpes , uk i was on the donation line last night and was completely humbled by all those who pledged , from a few pounds to a few hundred .
the amount did n't matter , it was people giving what they could afford .
to all those humbugs out there , i 'm sorry you will never know the pleasure of speaking to every single fantastic person who phoned us last night .
stuart , cleethorpes , uk two 6 year olds from west derby liverpool , rosa and scarlett made and sold red nose cakes and raised £ 40 for red nose day .
it was very cold and windy but we did n't mind because we wanted to care for the children in africa .

rita eustace , bishop 's stortford , uk photos were taken of people with funny hair dos simon chan , taunton , somerset our college council organised a rnd hair do competition where photos were taken of people with funny hair dos , and prizes were provided by local companies .
i personally did the donations , and donations from the council alone accumulated to at least £ 120 .
the leaf division sold red noses , and it was lots of fun .
i had my hair dyed red and i wore a suit .
simon chan , taunton , somerset staff and children of little rainbows day nursery wore wigs , red noses and dressed in colours of the rainbow .
the children have been busy making and selling badges , selling the red noses , staff and parents having a go on the official sweepstake and finally bringing into nursery lots of pennies to make a " mile of pennies " .
in total we raised £ 191.33 sandra wheeler , barrow-in-furness , cumbria , england it 's 3am and we 've just got in from " work " !
the contact centre where we work for jobcentre plus , was open to take pledges from 7pm until 2am taking in excess of £ 150,000 .
it was a great evening and a pleasure to be involved in such a good cause .
congratulations to all the organisers , you did a fantastic job !
helen and iain , telford , shropshire i dressed as elvis and sang loudly at the unsuspecting public in bath , making over 500 pounds over the day !
me and many other members of university rags raised tens of thousands in street collections and silly stunts across the country .
huseyin , bath , uk ca n't believe some people on here are moaning about red nose day ...
my kids were up early this morning for red hair colour and no uniform at school .
great stuff .
raising money for charity and a bit of fun as well .
long may it continue .
john , london , uk i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair jon murtagh , lincoln i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair .
he did n't look best pleased , but had to grin and bear it , whilst handing over a £ 1 to the swear box .
jon murtagh , lincoln , uk in my office we are having office e-mail bingo , a football tournament , a team quiz , office olympics and numerous other fundraising events in addition to dressing up .
it 's one day of the year when raising money for charity also really raises a smile -lrb- even a giggle at the sight of your colleagues in a red wig , t-shirt and nose -rrb- .
rowan , livingston , scotland i work for royal mail and they are allowing me to dress up as elvis , -lrb- white cat suit , wig , glasses , etc -rrb- .
i will be delivering the mail on a stretch of chiswick high road .
vinny o 'connor , chiswick , london w4 after my shift at work i will be joining many colleagues from the call centre i work at in durham .
we will be taking the pledges from viewers of comic relief - we are all volunteering until 2am so dig deep ! ! !
julie , tyne & wear i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues dominique guyot , bristol , uk i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues .
a qualified hairdresser has agreed to come and do it .
i 've managed to raise £ 300 in sponsorship money from friends and colleagues .
i do n't normally wear my hair short , let alone none at all !
dominique guyot , bristol , uk red nose day is a fantastic day !
it puts all problems into perspective , when you see the courage and bravery of people who go through so much with so little .
i do not understand how people can not donate to such a deserving cause .
naomi sharman , leeds most people at our work are not bothering to participate in our dressing up day but there 's a few red-haired people with their clothes on back to front , one person in pyjamas and a few red noses around .
david hilton , hudds , uk when i hear some of the comments on these pages , i feel ashamed to be british -lrb- and i 'm a very patriotic person -rrb- .
i 've just donated £ 100 on your behalf to make up for the moaning .
davu , buck i will be doing absolutely nothing , and refusing to pay for our dress-down day at work .
i will decide when i am going to donate to charity , and no-one is going to get money out of me any other way .
in fact , events like red nose day just force me to tighten the purse strings even more !
andy , leeds , uk my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day ian child , orpington , kent i have just finished reading the comments on this website and ca n't believe that there are people in this country that do n't care or are just not interested .
my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day .
ian child , orpington , kent all my work colleagues are dressed in red , buying wonderful home-made cakes , contributing financially .
in a very busy environment people are much more smiley and relaxed .
it does wonders for team working too !
jan , brighton as it 's red nose day i 've taken the day off work , as i do every red nose or children in need day .
why ?
because i refuse to pay £ 1 for a piddly slice of cake and being made to feel guilty if i do n't buy a piece .
red nose day is lame ...
it 's cringe worthy and embarrassing .
gemma , surrey we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london i work in a large london office , there is no indication whatsoever that this is red nose day .
nothing is red , nobody has dressed up , there are no special cakes and no collection box of any kind .
it 's not because anyone has banned it , it 's never been mentioned .
we 're all too busy doing our work ...
we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london , england nothing .
i fear that every time the nation gives to charity mr brown takes note , then he knows how much he can squeeze out of us with stealth taxes .
robert , london , uk i can not believe the attitude of most of the people on here !
i agree that we need to think long term about poverty , which is why i give so much a month to christian aid .
but most people do n't give regularly .
comic relief raises millions every year , of course that does some good !
caroline , oldham after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness catherine o , maidenhead , uk if these comments really do reflect the balance of public opinion , they paint a pretty depressing picture of british attitudes .
like many people , i make regular donations to good causes and do n't usually give to tv appeals but after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness .
catherine o , maidenhead , uk our school is very charity minded , we have kids and staff in all red , male staff in drag , sponsored walkers , dancers and silences ... you name it !
it 's a festival for a good cause !
vicki , london here in the cosmetics team at boots hq , the fellas in the team have agreed to a ' make-over ' if us girls raise £ 100 -lrb- well on our way -rrb- .
lipsticks , blush and nail polish at the ready !
lisa , notts , england well i 'm sitting typing this at work in my pyjamas .
i am the charity co-ordinator at my work and we always get so much from our colleagues !
i think that if we have things and other people do n't then we should help them out .
red nose day does n't come every year , so give as much as you can that 's what i say .
sara , aberdeen , scotland we have gone mad at work this year .
while most of us ca n't get away with wearing daft costumes , we are wearing red , but there are some cross-dressers kicking about , a bake-off , mad hair , mad clothes and everyone is giving their hard earned money with a really big smile on their faces .
even the " boring " ones have been persuaded to join in !
long live red nose day !
claire , chesterfield , uk we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour benedict taylor , long eaton , uk at trent college in long eaton my boarding house are doing a sponsored hymnathon .
we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour .
so far it looks as though we get around £ 250 for comic relief .
benedict taylor , long eaton , uk ignoring it .
this charity fest supports causes that are , in my opinion , not worthy target your giving and make sure it goes where its needed .
freddy , uk how can these people who claim to be ' charited out ' sleep at night ?
i believe if you can not put your hands in your pockets a couple of times a year in order to give to people less fortunate than your selves , then you live in a very cynical and selfish world .
most of us in the uk are privileged to lead comfortable lives , if you can not be bothered to support those who have the tenacity and courage to say " no this is not right , we can do something to help these people " then shame on you .
danny - yorkshire , goole uk i have baked some red nose biscuits , and am selling them for a minimum of 20p each , but hoping that people will donate more .
gina saunders , oxford , uk i 'm doing " sponsor a pigtail " at work !
for every donation of 50p i get from a colleague , i put an extra pigtail in my hair .
unfortunately it 's going down so well that my arms are aching , but it 's worth it to fill my little collecting box .
sarah b , york , uk i give by direct debit to 3 smaller charities every month -lrb- for the last 5 years -rrb- so i am no scrooge .
however , i find my self unimpressed and unmoved by the emotional blackmail tactics used on tv .
i also deplore the idealistic ' making poverty history ' claims -lrb- it ai n't gonna happen far to pie in the sky ! -rrb-
i will not watch the ego fest that is comic relief ; i am tired of seeing talent less publicity seeking so called ' celebs ' embarrassing attempts to " entertain " .
if they really cared , they just donate and save us the embarrassment .
i would rather give my hard earned cash to help charities of my choice in this country .
meg , grantham lincs sorry , has victor meldrew hijacked this forum as a fundraising gag ? - that 's the impression i 'm getting from all the whingeing and self-righteous comments on here !
but no , unfortunately the comments are genuine , and very disappointing .
i for one will be donating tonight and enjoying the entertainment , which hopefully will restore my faith .
long live comic relief !
mary , gloucester , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day -lrb- with red sauce -rrb- , we are wearing something red and for the afternoon we have strawberries and cream , mmmm .
the diet starts monday , after all it 's for charity !
elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk in our fish and chip shop we 've all contributed in wearing the red nose day t-shirts , spraying our hair red and going wild on the make up .
we all look so funny away from the boring uniform we all usually wear .
maria , kidderminster , uk the staff at british gas in leeds are taking phone pledges this evening until midnight .
stacey kerrigan , leeds , uk sprayed my three children 's ' hair red , spiked my hair and sprayed it red , bought them a red nose each , put money in the bucket at my sons school , think i 've done my bit for comic relief .
al , milton keynes , uk our college -lrb- sfx college , clapham -rrb- are doing a variety of events -lrb- which have been happening this week -rrb- held by our student council , this includes dressing up in your old school uniform , competitions and selling fair trade products , including drinks and food , they will also be selling the white wrists bands to promote making poverty history .
our college is hoping that we as a college community will raise lots of money for a great cause !
mel , london i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we are having a raffle with donated gifts -lrb- mostly alcohol ! -rrb- from staff , we have the red nose scratch and match and are selling cakes , etc which people kindly brought in .
we also have staff with red hair and one with not so much hair , so big red dots on his head !
i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we raised £ 250 last week holding a cake sale in the biological sciences department at the university of liverpool .
everyone was so generous , with some people paying up to £ 10 for 1 cake !
the microbiology department , liverpool , uk after a hectic morning of red hair dyes , face paint and frantic scrabbling for red clothes - i 've taken the children to school -lrb- non-uniform day , with lots of stalls to raise more money -rrb- , with a pocket full of change each and will now spend the day cleaning the house , so that tonight i can settle down with the family and watch some entertainment on tv !
i will probably end up crying my eyes out - and donating more money than i can afford - but hey !
that 's what comic relief is all about !
jb , essex i 'm going to my uni lectures dressed as a giant bumblebee iona knight , exeter , devon it 's all very well to say that you give to a charity of your choice but the fact is that an event like red nose day mobilizes a lot of people to actually do something to raise cash and also awareness .
people can raise a lot of money at planned events and along with the noses , car accessories , stickers , ring tones , etc a huge amount is generated for the charities in question .
i 'm not really the sort of person who would put myself out there doing something " wacky " either but i can see why it 's a good thing that a lot of people do and i certainly would n't begrudge them my cash .
ann , scotland message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work liz wood , reading all the kids in our primary school brought £ 1 in today for the privilege of dressing up and having red hair .
they are also doing a talent show this afternoon .
my daughter bryony and her friend conor are doing a sponsored silence tomorrow .
all the proceeds will go to red nose day .
all great fun ways to raise money for a great cause .
message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work !
nyree dick , coaltown of balgonie , fife dressed up as fairy .
liz wood , reading i think the red noses are brilliant , but the sheer amount of tv coverage is rather ott in my opinion .
my place of work is n't doing anything for comic relief .
i work in the reception so have stuck my red nose on top of my monitor to brighten things up .
it was my birthday yesterday so tonight i shall be celebrating that by going out for a meal with friends .
helen , southampton , uk what will i be doing ?
looking for a red nose !
why on earth only restrict selling them to sainsbury and oxfam - then allow them to sell out in south wales ?
why not treat them like poppies and sell everywhere ?
okay - rant over - but if it was n't for the good will of an old friend , my 6-year-old lad would have felt very left out in school today - as others no doubt will .
please fix it next year .
tony , wales well i beeped my horn at aled from the chris moyles red nose rally this morning in plymouth .

i think it is vital for local newspapers to get in the mood and encourage the thousands of people who are making an effort to raise money for such a worthwhile cause .
craig evry , trowbridge , uk we 're a small elite company of structural and civil engineers with big hearts and the boss suggested we come in school uniform .
we 're off to harry 's restaurant at lunchtime for school dinners !
our pea shooters and catapults have been confiscated .

graeme ellis , warwick today we are all dressed in red and are holding an afternoon tea of cucumber sandwiches and cakes for our colleagues . £ 2.50 each to attend , so social too .
lots of takers .
sarah k , cambridge sponsorship going well stu maddison , west london dressed as a sunderland footballer for the day , complete with flatcap and ne accent .
my legs have attracted comment and the quality of my accent has varied .
i 'm from hants , but have ne blood and got my degree up there .
sponsorship going well .
stu maddison , west london as someone who 's been involved in charity fundraising and voluntary work for years i 've read the other comments with a mixture of horror and anger .
let 's just remember that the key thing about charitably fundraising is that you give freely and willingly .
there 's no " feel guilty " about most of the collectors out there .
they 're doing something positive and you 're just being asked to support that .
as for the " self-serving actor " rubbish .
do me a favour wake up to yourselves .
sure there are a couple like that but the majority do it because they 're in a position to do something positive .
i 've seen that commitment up close and personal .

leanne , cornwall it 's a real good fun atmosphere hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset i work for the local government and all 900 people in the building have been giving me money for comic relief .
it 's a real good fun atmosphere in here today and i reckon we will break £ 1000 by next week ! !
hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset we are donating the fares from one tram to comic relief - which could be up to £ 5,000 !
the chosen tram will be decorated with posters highlighting it as the ' red nose day tram ' .
nottingham 's trams , nottingham , uk the staff at highways agency office in birmingham are seeing red and losing their heads ! !
several sponsored events include dressing as a clown , shaving half of a beard off and having a very dodgy red mullet-do ! !
also tea and cake sales have been arranged for this lunchtime and most people are wearing red items of clothing and donating a £ 1 to support comic relief .
laura , birmingham we here at bt parkside in coventry are preparing to man some of the donation lines for tonight 's pledges ... wish us luck .
sarah 's team , coventry , uk at 11 o 'clock on friday 11th we just waxed 11 legs from 6 volunteers .
they were all men and screamed like babies .
sarah lewendon , basingstoke a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard dave love , kesgrave , england a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard - and he looks a bit like a lady !
he looks great sitting in an open plan office .
dave love , kesgrave , england i shall be watching it and lending it my moral support .
i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i think it 's more important that people take the opportunity to contribute regularly to a charity or two throughout the year rather than give sporadically .
set up a direct debit to a charity for as little as a couple of pounds a month and everyone wins .
you feel good , the charity gets the money it needs .
the only drawback is that there would be no need for shows like tonight 's comic relief !
mo c , uk today we 're holding a raffle with prizes donated by the bosses ; dressing down in denim and red -lrb- quite brave for a solicitors ' office ! -rrb- and having an auction for a fast boat trip .
we 'll probably only raise about £ 300 but every penny helps .
bearing in mind that people have given generously to the tsunami appeal , we 'll be happy about any amount we raise .
sue , southampton , uk to those who rattle their tins and dress in ridiculous costumes and try to make me feel guilty for not joining in the " fun " : you 've no idea whether i give up my evenings and weekends to work in a homeless shelter ; you do n't know that i 'm not an activist for amnesty international ; you have n't a clue what charities i support with tax-efficient , gift-aided standing orders .
this may be one day for you , but please do n't judge everyone by your standards and assume the stony-faced people who are avoiding you are uncharitable .
some of them are just fed up with the patronising and accusing judgements .
anon i was on a tall ships youth trust square rig sailing ship -lrb- stavros s niarchos -rrb- in the canaries last week and i climbed to the top of the 45 metre mast to raise money for comic relief .
i have raised over £ 750 so far from sponsors where i work - boden - and from fellow crew members on the ship .
pete lemon , great hampden , uk i am being sponsored to be silent in the office all day !
it 's going to be a tough job with the crazy crew i work with ! !
robert , london the cardiff and vale of glamorgan scout network will be joining other scouts from the area to virtually row , run and cycle the distance from cardiff to london between 16:30 - 18:30 today outside debenhams in st david 's arcade , cardiff .
please come and support us if you are in the city centre .
gareth , cardiff , wales i will be manning the donation lines for the night dan tremain , bromley as i work for one of the big companies that are allegedly hijacking comic relief to boost sales i will be manning the donation lines for the night .
dan tremain , bromley i am amazed that some people are writing in saying that they are ' charitied out ' .
i agree that we ca n't all keep giving to all the good causes out there , but that does n't mean we have to lose our compassion for those less fortunate both at home and abroad .
for the sake of £ 1 for a red nose -lrb- whether you wear it or not -rrb- you can add that little drop to the ocean .
if everyone in the uk bought a £ 1 red nose - it would raise £ 55 million - and that would go a very , very long way ...
clare , scotland a couple of teams from within our youth football club staged an rnd benefit match last weekend and raised £ 78 .
we hope to top that up towards the end of the month when we are staging a second benefit game for the red nose cause .
chris cox , fawley falcons youth f.c , southampton , uk the snide and selfish attitudes expressed by many here will be enough to make me take part .
peter , birmingham so far we have raised over £ 200 jo , birmingham my company is having a dress down day .
so far we have raised over £ 200 .
i can not believe some of these comments .
i would like to think that if the table was turned , africa would help us out .
i realise that people have probably given to the tsunami appeal , but africa still needs our help , as do the hundreds of charities in the uk who benefit .
stop being such kill joys ! !
jo , birmingham red clothes , red lipstick , red hair - cakes , quizzes and fun !
fiona , tina , cath , jill and louise , dundee , uk severn trent telephone room girls have brought jelly beans , put them into a pot and the other employees have to guess how many to win a bottle of bubbly .
we are also doing the sweepstake , of course wearing red noses and red hair .
mel halligan , birmingham , england well what happened to good old fashioned humour ?
i turned up for work in a spacesuit for red nose day , only to be told by my boss to ' sort myself out ' .
it 's no wonder so many people have stress related sick days .
tony , derby 4 of us are wearing wigs and generally having a laugh .
julie , glasgow , scotland i 've got the red gel in my hair , face paint on my face and my red nose hanging round my neck - and a big comic relief bucket by my desk for donations !
anj , reading in hbos financial services in leeds we have a tombola , cake stall , red nose cake raffle -lrb- i 've made a cake that looks like a nose ! -rrb- and quiz sheets , plus fining anyone not wearing red !
jane robson , leeds , england making cakes , red nose day sweepstake , and dressing up all red .
hope to give everyone a laugh or a stomach cramp after eating my cakes .
anyway , hope to add my small collection to the larger pot !
happy red nose day .
hannah , bedfordshire coming from the states , where the most organised charity appeal is the rather pathetic jerry lewis telethon , red nose day is a real treat and a great way to get people involved in giving to those less fortunate .
my daughter 's school has a full day of activities planned and i 've sent her off with a sack of pound coins to give away .
as for me , i 'll hitch my red nose to my bike basket and later this evening , tune into fame academy .
lisa , cambridge hopefully we can do our bit sandy , cambridgeshire the vets and nurses at the broadway vet hospital are wearing pyjamas and dressing gowns for the day - and it 's cold .
hopefully we can do our bit , we have our mascot molly the terrier here as well .
sandy , cambridgeshire my son 's school is getting them all to come in dressed in something red , and he 's got a mad ' barnett ' for the day too .
he 's been so excited about wearing this all week , i thought we 'd never get to friday !
fair play to the headmaster , he 's always up for anything which helps the children to get a perspective on the real world , and let 's face it the world is bonkers !
eoin , cornwall , uk please try to sell red noses etc through more outlets next time .
we do not have a sainsbury or oxfam shop locally and when i tried to buy goods over the net they were all sold out .
sue sorrell , blackburn , england our office for the first time ever celebrated red nose day and the girls made rolls and bacon and rolls and sausage - total £ 80 .
not bad for a small office .
lisa , uk i am sporting a ridiculously red hairstyle at work today and charging people for singing them a song .
so far we 've raised over £ 60 .
whooppee !
alison , broadstairs , uk myself and my colleagues are taking phone pledges until midnight .
mark , leeds , uk some people 's attitudes stink !
especially those who claim we should n't give money abroad .
they 're human too !
and besides , money goes to the uk too - get your facts right before posting !
ross , halesowen , uk two of my work colleagues - nicola and alex have cooked us all sausage and bacon sandwiches for breakfast and are doing the same for lunch !
we are all donating generously !
sophie cope , godalming , surrey our colleague bob gould is having his beard shaved off after 20 years and has raised £ 450 .
sheila evans , sevenoaks , kent , uk dye your hair , have a laugh lesley smart , carluke , scotland what an absolute joy it was in our house this morning , as my two sons , aged 4 and 11 , got ready for school / nursery , with their red hair spray , red clothes and red noses , having such fun but thinking of others .
yes we do have a lot of charities looking for our support , but is n't this a fun way of helping others .
go on dye your hair , have a laugh , at least we in this country are free to do these things if we wish .
lesley smart , carluke , scotland i bought the little britain dvd and have donated some money for cakes that someone 's kindly brought in !
paul , milton keynes we 're doing hair spraying , head shaving , and running a mega raffle with prizes including : win a mini for a week .
nottingham panthers players coming down at 1pm .
the cornerhouse in nottingham , nottingham , england it 's one day of the year that we should all support martin , brighton , uk i can not believe the attitude of some people .
it may be a little bit wacky but it 's one day of the year that we should all support , from our nice warm homes .
martin , brighton , uk comic relief would be great if only my school would allow us to do something .
we are not allowed to dye our hair red or put face paint on or even wear non-uniform .
louisa , reading , uk for me , comic relief has been hijacked by big retail companies who are more interested in boosting sales than donating to charities , and if the tv coverage follows the style of recent years it will be 80 % embarrassing , 10 % guilt and 10 % watchable entertainment .
jon dalladay , london , uk holding the ' great red nose bake-off ' .
talented colleagues bake cakes and every one pays £ 1 to eat them and vote on the best .
a great excuse to eat cake on a friday afternoon .
kirsten , glasgow i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i 'm fed up of red nose day and children in need and their ilk .
i give to various charities on a regular basis .
i do n't need what is essentially lazy television scheduling to try to persuade me to give more .
ian , leeds i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume rs , glasgow uk i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume and trying to make miserable old scrooges realise that living in one of the richest countries in the world carries responsibilities to ones fellow man .
oh , and making people feel guilty too .
rs , glasgow uk how much do we need to donate to keep ruby wax and robbie williams off our tvs ?
philippe , london , uk colouring my hair red , putting on a nose and a big smile and waiting for little britain 's comic relief special !
christine , uk while people may be tired of red nose day -lrb- and i am too , in fact i was never into it when it first came out -rrb- , i am dismayed at some of the comments here .
i may not like red nose day , but i do enjoy giving and helping out groups and charities of my choice , i am certainly not all charitied out .
the voluntary sector makes a massive difference to peoples lives locally , nationally and internationally and these hard working charities need out support .
if all charities were to disappear tomorrow we would soon know about it and the world would be much worse place .
it 's very easy to moan about giving from the comfort of your own laptop , having had the luck to be born in the west .
some people at my university are selling cookies for red nose day tomorrow , i will buy some of those and offload my small change to anyone with a collection box , it all helps .
i am glad that at least some people here are going all out in their fund raising efforts and wish them all the best , it 's good to see some charity and community spirit exists around here .
amy , colchester they should do what they did the other year .
every hour they picked someone who donated on the phone and they won vip tickets to a football match .
i feel more people would give if they felt they had a chance of winning something .
chris h , lincoln i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it alex young , grantham , lincs i 'm doing nothing .
i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it .
children in need should give it a rest for a few years .
it 's not that i 'm not a giving person , i give money to the odd charity now and then .
there should be a rnli day that is a charity that really needs the public donations .
alex young , grantham , lincs we have finally managed to persuade our school to have a non uniform day , and several people are shaving their hair off .
unfortunately , there does n't seem to be any red noses around where i live , otherwise i 'd buy one .
emily , cumbria , uk what am i doing ?
absolutely nothing .
i have charity fatigue and resent other people trying to make me feel guilty for not joining in days and days of begging by tin-rattlers , topped off by hours of unfunny ' comedy ' sketches .
if i want to give to charity , i will .
in my own time and not because it is pc to do so .
i hesitate to mention this as discretion is the better part of valour , but i do voluntary work , i just do n't feel the need to advertise the details of my deeds -lrb- or donations -rrb- on television .
nichola feeney , dundee , scotland i have decided to boycott comic relief this year and donate my money to other charities instead .
it was not a decision i made lightly , but the fact that this year 's theme is the same as last year 's , and the general coverage , has persuaded me that all anyone cares about anymore is celebrities mucking around in funny hairdos .
actually helping the disadvantaged seems like some sort of side issue .
r potter , cambridge , uk this time red nose will get nothing from me bumble , dartford , uk with so many charities chasing donation 's , is it little wonder that sooner or later we will all get charity fatigue .
so this time red nose will get nothing from me .
bumble , dartford , uk i will be out celebrating my birthday - probably wearing nothing but a hairy red nose !
rachel , ipswich , uk anyone see the episode of the office where they have red nose day ?
i am with tim - work 's idea of " wackiness " does n't really do it for me , but i will donate .
fraser , essex , england i will give some money and then go out instead of watching self-publicising celebrities prance about on tv .
it seems a coincidence to me that they 're so happy to give up their time when they have a book / musical / tv show to promote .
julie , brighton , england when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term paul , london i 'll be writing to my mp demanding that gordon brown keeps to his commitments to long term aid for the third world .
sorry to be a misery but comic relief money is a drop in the ocean and i find something obscene in multi-million salaried celebrities showing footage of starving children whilst being happy and nice and we all feel guilty , give some cash , pat ourselves on the back and feel like generally nice folk .
please people , when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term - comic relief will solve them for a fraction of the sufferers for a day .
paul , london ignoring it completely .
i give to the charities of my choice , not the charities i 'm told to give to by celebrities who " give their time for free " -lrb- read : gain some free self-publicity and tell me to open my wallet without opening their own -rrb- john b , uk money from appeals like this is sent to these people in order to help themselves -lrb- the presenters take great pains in telling us that all they want is to help themselves -rrb- .
the question is " why are these people still in need of such help after 20 years of red nose day ? " .
if this is all they want , i find it hard to believe that it would take 20 years .
i heard billy connolly try to shame us into believing that " compassion fatigue " is a myth , but after 20 years of donating and seeing no change in their situation , it is indeed a very real thing !
paul , nottingham , uk red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off william read , staffordshire nothing .
it is well past its sell by date , and the sooner it is put out of its misery the better .
red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off .
william read , stafford , staffordshire maybe i 'm selfish , but i do n't see the point in donating money abroad when we have our own problems to deal with , such as homelessness on our streets .
this has been going on for 20 years yet the same problems still exist abroad , i do n't think throwing some cash at them every year will ever solve it .
ed , ayrshire i have already done my bit by donating .
on the night i will be avoiding the tv screen at all costs .
the very thought of watching more than two minutes of ' comedians ' lenny henry , liza tarbuck and dawn french brings me out in hives .
leon , brighouse , uk will the public dig deep again ?
maybe the tsunami appeal has taken the country 's generosity ! come on people africa needs aid too !
dean chambers , castleford , uk the same as every year - buying a bottle of wine and watching films .
whilst i support charity , i want to choose those i support and do not want it rammed down my throat .
carolyn , england sorry , but i 'm all charity 'd out and wo n't watching or donating this year .
j , oxford it has created a real buzz around the office kiltie , staffs , uk we have managed to persuade our very staid company to allow us to have a fancy dress fun day .
we are having a fete theme with tombola stall , name the elephant , raffle , guess the babies plus prizes for the best and worst outfits .
staff are also doing their own little bits - ie two ladies are dressing as saloon girls and if they raise fifty pounds by 1pm they will go to tesco 's in their outfits to buy their lunch !
it has created a real buzz around the office and has been the only topic of conversation all day .
we ca n't wait ! ! !
kiltie , staffs , uk i wo n't be doing anything for red nose day as my work is relocating the following day and we have to pack away last minute things and help the removal men .
as for watching it , i find it the most pointless 6/7 hours and would rather be playing board games .
charity does not need blanket tv coverage .
by the way i have donated £ 10 to comic relief .
helen , leeds what will i be doing ?
doing my best to avoid aggressive tin-rattlers dressed in ridiculous costumes who will be doing their best to make me feel guilty , and failing miserably .
trevor , cambs , uk our office is going all out for red nose day , from sponsoring members of staff to dress up as cartoon characters to spot the red hairdo on our intranet .
not everyone is taking an active part , but everyone is giving something .
if everyone was a moany old skinflint like trevor there would n't be anyone left alive in third world countries !
cheer up it 's for a good cause !
kelly , edinburgh , scotland absolutely nothing apart from trying to avoid the irritating tin shakers on my way home in the evening .
i give to the charities i choose to , not the ones that have big enough budgets to try and guilt trip people into giving them money with footage of starving orphans .

your comments : i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " sass , somerset the school where i work has organised a strictly come dancing contest where the children are teaching teams of staff to perform dance routines and then children pay to vote for the winners .
i spent comic relief night in front of the telly , wildly fluctuating between laughter and tears watching the film cameos from africa - it makes you realise what a rich life we all are privileged to live here , when it takes so little to make others in desperate need so happy .
i loved peter kaye and " amarillo " - such a happy song and a simple but effective video .
hope it gets to number one !
i 'm happy to give time and money to causes like this , long may it continue .
sass , somerset well i spent the night working on the donation line - having been semi dragged into helping by a friend of mine .
i was incredibly glad she did do so - we only meant to stay till 10pm , but were still going when our call centre ran out of forms at 1.30am.
it was a brilliant and humbling experience .
people donated what they could from a few pounds to a thousand plus and the atmosphere was great .
completely different from my day job , but my way of helping comic relief - i could donate little so was glad to help where i could .
roz , bradford , uk we sponsored our good mate emma to dress as barbie for a full day of college .
she raised over £ 120 - well done girly : d becca , birmingham just donated - if i have to go without a few pints because a day which reminds us all how lucky we are and how unfortunate some are asks me to then that 's fine .
we all have a responsibility since it is in no small part the imposition of a particular western brand of economic capitalism on many nations which has left them playing catch-up .
evan , edinburgh people giving what they could afford stuart , cleethorpes , uk i was on the donation line last night and was completely humbled by all those who pledged , from a few pounds to a few hundred .
the amount did n't matter , it was people giving what they could afford .
to all those humbugs out there , i 'm sorry you will never know the pleasure of speaking to every single fantastic person who phoned us last night .
stuart , cleethorpes , uk two 6 year olds from west derby liverpool , rosa and scarlett made and sold red nose cakes and raised £ 40 for red nose day .

the leaf division sold red noses , and it was lots of fun .
i had my hair dyed red and i wore a suit .
simon chan , taunton , somerset staff and children of little rainbows day nursery wore wigs , red noses and dressed in colours of the rainbow .

helen and iain , telford , shropshire i dressed as elvis and sang loudly at the unsuspecting public in bath , making over 500 pounds over the day !
me and many other members of university rags raised tens of thousands in street collections and silly stunts across the country .
huseyin , bath , uk ca n't believe some people on here are moaning about red nose day ...
my kids were up early this morning for red hair colour and no uniform at school .
great stuff .
raising money for charity and a bit of fun as well .
long may it continue .
john , london , uk i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair jon murtagh , lincoln i 'm literally the office joker and have already placed a whoopi cushion under the boss 's chair .
he did n't look best pleased , but had to grin and bear it , whilst handing over a £ 1 to the swear box .
jon murtagh , lincoln , uk in my office we are having office e-mail bingo , a football tournament , a team quiz , office olympics and numerous other fundraising events in addition to dressing up .
it 's one day of the year when raising money for charity also really raises a smile -lrb- even a giggle at the sight of your colleagues in a red wig , t-shirt and nose -rrb- .
rowan , livingston , scotland i work for royal mail and they are allowing me to dress up as elvis , -lrb- white cat suit , wig , glasses , etc -rrb- .
i will be delivering the mail on a stretch of chiswick high road .
vinny o 'connor , chiswick , london w4 after my shift at work i will be joining many colleagues from the call centre i work at in durham .
we will be taking the pledges from viewers of comic relief - we are all volunteering until 2am so dig deep ! ! !
julie , tyne & wear i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues dominique guyot , bristol , uk i 've foolishly agreed to have my hair shaved off completely in my office , in front of all my colleagues .
a qualified hairdresser has agreed to come and do it .
i 've managed to raise £ 300 in sponsorship money from friends and colleagues .
i do n't normally wear my hair short , let alone none at all !
dominique guyot , bristol , uk red nose day is a fantastic day !
it puts all problems into perspective , when you see the courage and bravery of people who go through so much with so little .
i do not understand how people can not donate to such a deserving cause .
naomi sharman , leeds most people at our work are not bothering to participate in our dressing up day but there 's a few red-haired people with their clothes on back to front , one person in pyjamas and a few red noses around .
david hilton , hudds , uk when i hear some of the comments on these pages , i feel ashamed to be british -lrb- and i 'm a very patriotic person -rrb- .
i 've just donated £ 100 on your behalf to make up for the moaning .
davu , buck i will be doing absolutely nothing , and refusing to pay for our dress-down day at work .
i will decide when i am going to donate to charity , and no-one is going to get money out of me any other way .
in fact , events like red nose day just force me to tighten the purse strings even more !
andy , leeds , uk my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day ian child , orpington , kent i have just finished reading the comments on this website and ca n't believe that there are people in this country that do n't care or are just not interested .
my son is eight-years-old and has given his pocket money this week to red nose day .
ian child , orpington , kent all my work colleagues are dressed in red , buying wonderful home-made cakes , contributing financially .
in a very busy environment people are much more smiley and relaxed .
it does wonders for team working too !
jan , brighton as it 's red nose day i 've taken the day off work , as i do every red nose or children in need day .
why ?
because i refuse to pay £ 1 for a piddly slice of cake and being made to feel guilty if i do n't buy a piece .
red nose day is lame ...
it 's cringe worthy and embarrassing .
gemma , surrey we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london i work in a large london office , there is no indication whatsoever that this is red nose day .
nothing is red , nobody has dressed up , there are no special cakes and no collection box of any kind .
it 's not because anyone has banned it , it 's never been mentioned .
we 're all too busy doing our work ...
we 're just too busy , too stressed , to find time .
anon , london , england nothing .
i fear that every time the nation gives to charity mr brown takes note , then he knows how much he can squeeze out of us with stealth taxes .
robert , london , uk i can not believe the attitude of most of the people on here !
i agree that we need to think long term about poverty , which is why i give so much a month to christian aid .
but most people do n't give regularly .
comic relief raises millions every year , of course that does some good !
caroline , oldham after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness catherine o , maidenhead , uk if these comments really do reflect the balance of public opinion , they paint a pretty depressing picture of british attitudes .
like many people , i make regular donations to good causes and do n't usually give to tv appeals but after reading this , i am going to be making a donation just to distance myself from all of this bitter mean-spiritedness .
catherine o , maidenhead , uk our school is very charity minded , we have kids and staff in all red , male staff in drag , sponsored walkers , dancers and silences ... you name it !
it 's a festival for a good cause !
vicki , london here in the cosmetics team at boots hq , the fellas in the team have agreed to a ' make-over ' if us girls raise £ 100 -lrb- well on our way -rrb- .
lipsticks , blush and nail polish at the ready !
lisa , notts , england well i 'm sitting typing this at work in my pyjamas .
i am the charity co-ordinator at my work and we always get so much from our colleagues !
i think that if we have things and other people do n't then we should help them out .
red nose day does n't come every year , so give as much as you can that 's what i say .
sara , aberdeen , scotland we have gone mad at work this year .
while most of us ca n't get away with wearing daft costumes , we are wearing red , but there are some cross-dressers kicking about , a bake-off , mad hair , mad clothes and everyone is giving their hard earned money with a really big smile on their faces .
even the " boring " ones have been persuaded to join in !
long live red nose day !
claire , chesterfield , uk we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour benedict taylor , long eaton , uk at trent college in long eaton my boarding house are doing a sponsored hymnathon .
we are receiving sponsorship to see how many hymns we can sing in an hour .
so far it looks as though we get around £ 250 for comic relief .
benedict taylor , long eaton , uk ignoring it .
this charity fest supports causes that are , in my opinion , not worthy target your giving and make sure it goes where its needed .
freddy , uk how can these people who claim to be ' charited out ' sleep at night ?
i believe if you can not put your hands in your pockets a couple of times a year in order to give to people less fortunate than your selves , then you live in a very cynical and selfish world .
most of us in the uk are privileged to lead comfortable lives , if you can not be bothered to support those who have the tenacity and courage to say " no this is not right , we can do something to help these people " then shame on you .
danny - yorkshire , goole uk i have baked some red nose biscuits , and am selling them for a minimum of 20p each , but hoping that people will donate more .
gina saunders , oxford , uk i 'm doing " sponsor a pigtail " at work !
for every donation of 50p i get from a colleague , i put an extra pigtail in my hair .
unfortunately it 's going down so well that my arms are aching , but it 's worth it to fill my little collecting box .
sarah b , york , uk i give by direct debit to 3 smaller charities every month -lrb- for the last 5 years -rrb- so i am no scrooge .
however , i find my self unimpressed and unmoved by the emotional blackmail tactics used on tv .
i also deplore the idealistic ' making poverty history ' claims -lrb- it ai n't gonna happen far to pie in the sky ! -rrb-
i will not watch the ego fest that is comic relief ; i am tired of seeing talent less publicity seeking so called ' celebs ' embarrassing attempts to " entertain " .
if they really cared , they just donate and save us the embarrassment .
i would rather give my hard earned cash to help charities of my choice in this country .
meg , grantham lincs sorry , has victor meldrew hijacked this forum as a fundraising gag ? - that 's the impression i 'm getting from all the whingeing and self-righteous comments on here !
but no , unfortunately the comments are genuine , and very disappointing .
i for one will be donating tonight and enjoying the entertainment , which hopefully will restore my faith .
long live comic relief !
mary , gloucester , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk we are having a comic relief bacon and sausage bap day -lrb- with red sauce -rrb- , we are wearing something red and for the afternoon we have strawberries and cream , mmmm .
the diet starts monday , after all it 's for charity !
elizabeth knight , burgess hill , uk in our fish and chip shop we 've all contributed in wearing the red nose day t-shirts , spraying our hair red and going wild on the make up .
we all look so funny away from the boring uniform we all usually wear .
maria , kidderminster , uk the staff at british gas in leeds are taking phone pledges this evening until midnight .
stacey kerrigan , leeds , uk sprayed my three children 's ' hair red , spiked my hair and sprayed it red , bought them a red nose each , put money in the bucket at my sons school , think i 've done my bit for comic relief .
al , milton keynes , uk our college -lrb- sfx college , clapham -rrb- are doing a variety of events -lrb- which have been happening this week -rrb- held by our student council , this includes dressing up in your old school uniform , competitions and selling fair trade products , including drinks and food , they will also be selling the white wrists bands to promote making poverty history .
our college is hoping that we as a college community will raise lots of money for a great cause !
mel , london i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we are having a raffle with donated gifts -lrb- mostly alcohol ! -rrb- from staff , we have the red nose scratch and match and are selling cakes , etc which people kindly brought in .
we also have staff with red hair and one with not so much hair , so big red dots on his head !
i do n't think it really hurts to donate something to the day , but respect others wishes not to .
alison , dundee we raised £ 250 last week holding a cake sale in the biological sciences department at the university of liverpool .
everyone was so generous , with some people paying up to £ 10 for 1 cake !
the microbiology department , liverpool , uk after a hectic morning of red hair dyes , face paint and frantic scrabbling for red clothes - i 've taken the children to school -lrb- non-uniform day , with lots of stalls to raise more money -rrb- , with a pocket full of change each and will now spend the day cleaning the house , so that tonight i can settle down with the family and watch some entertainment on tv !
i will probably end up crying my eyes out - and donating more money than i can afford - but hey !
that 's what comic relief is all about !
jb , essex i 'm going to my uni lectures dressed as a giant bumblebee iona knight , exeter , devon it 's all very well to say that you give to a charity of your choice but the fact is that an event like red nose day mobilizes a lot of people to actually do something to raise cash and also awareness .
people can raise a lot of money at planned events and along with the noses , car accessories , stickers , ring tones , etc a huge amount is generated for the charities in question .
i 'm not really the sort of person who would put myself out there doing something " wacky " either but i can see why it 's a good thing that a lot of people do and i certainly would n't begrudge them my cash .
ann , scotland message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work liz wood , reading all the kids in our primary school brought £ 1 in today for the privilege of dressing up and having red hair .
they are also doing a talent show this afternoon .
my daughter bryony and her friend conor are doing a sponsored silence tomorrow .
all the proceeds will go to red nose day .
all great fun ways to raise money for a great cause .
message to the celebrities involved - keep up the good work !
nyree dick , coaltown of balgonie , fife dressed up as fairy .
liz wood , reading i think the red noses are brilliant , but the sheer amount of tv coverage is rather ott in my opinion .
my place of work is n't doing anything for comic relief .
i work in the reception so have stuck my red nose on top of my monitor to brighten things up .
it was my birthday yesterday so tonight i shall be celebrating that by going out for a meal with friends .
helen , southampton , uk what will i be doing ?
looking for a red nose !
why on earth only restrict selling them to sainsbury and oxfam - then allow them to sell out in south wales ?
why not treat them like poppies and sell everywhere ?
okay - rant over - but if it was n't for the good will of an old friend , my 6-year-old lad would have felt very left out in school today - as others no doubt will .
please fix it next year .
tony , wales well i beeped my horn at aled from the chris moyles red nose rally this morning in plymouth .
and our little office raised £ 50 with the sweepstake and an easter egg raffle .
linda , mandy , carol , pj and the rest of the girls at serpells , plymouth i ca n't believe some of the miserable , selfish people on here !
talk about victor meldrow .
come on you skin flints !
i work at yell and not only are we opening as a call centre to take pledges but the whole office has joined in with raffles , cake competitions , dress down and various other activities .

the traffic is at walking pace anyway during rush-hour , so we do n't delay anyone , and the great majority of people seem happy to have the chance to take part , and give cheerfully and generously .
michael cutler , marlow , bucks tony is singing everything he says !
steph dodwell , chelmsford i work at anglia polytechnic university as an administrator .

becks , london we have dressed up one of our reporters at the wiltshire times in red nose kit .
i think it is vital for local newspapers to get in the mood and encourage the thousands of people who are making an effort to raise money for such a worthwhile cause .
craig evry , trowbridge , uk we 're a small elite company of structural and civil engineers with big hearts and the boss suggested we come in school uniform .

sarah k , cambridge sponsorship going well stu maddison , west london dressed as a sunderland footballer for the day , complete with flatcap and ne accent .
my legs have attracted comment and the quality of my accent has varied .
i 'm from hants , but have ne blood and got my degree up there .
sponsorship going well .
stu maddison , west london as someone who 's been involved in charity fundraising and voluntary work for years i 've read the other comments with a mixture of horror and anger .
let 's just remember that the key thing about charitably fundraising is that you give freely and willingly .
there 's no " feel guilty " about most of the collectors out there .
they 're doing something positive and you 're just being asked to support that .
as for the " self-serving actor " rubbish .
do me a favour wake up to yourselves .
sure there are a couple like that but the majority do it because they 're in a position to do something positive .
i 've seen that commitment up close and personal .
martin , sheffield , uk i have been wearing my red nose all day in work .

it 's a real good fun atmosphere in here today and i reckon we will break £ 1000 by next week ! !
hayley burgess , dorchester , dorset we are donating the fares from one tram to comic relief - which could be up to £ 5,000 !
the chosen tram will be decorated with posters highlighting it as the ' red nose day tram ' .

sarah lewendon , basingstoke a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard dave love , kesgrave , england a colleague has dressed as little britain 's emily howard - and he looks a bit like a lady !
he looks great sitting in an open plan office .
dave love , kesgrave , england i shall be watching it and lending it my moral support .
i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i think it 's more important that people take the opportunity to contribute regularly to a charity or two throughout the year rather than give sporadically .
set up a direct debit to a charity for as little as a couple of pounds a month and everyone wins .
you feel good , the charity gets the money it needs .
the only drawback is that there would be no need for shows like tonight 's comic relief !
mo c , uk today we 're holding a raffle with prizes donated by the bosses ; dressing down in denim and red -lrb- quite brave for a solicitors ' office ! -rrb- and having an auction for a fast boat trip .
we 'll probably only raise about £ 300 but every penny helps .
bearing in mind that people have given generously to the tsunami appeal , we 'll be happy about any amount we raise .
sue , southampton , uk to those who rattle their tins and dress in ridiculous costumes and try to make me feel guilty for not joining in the " fun " : you 've no idea whether i give up my evenings and weekends to work in a homeless shelter ; you do n't know that i 'm not an activist for amnesty international ; you have n't a clue what charities i support with tax-efficient , gift-aided standing orders .
this may be one day for you , but please do n't judge everyone by your standards and assume the stony-faced people who are avoiding you are uncharitable .
some of them are just fed up with the patronising and accusing judgements .
anon i was on a tall ships youth trust square rig sailing ship -lrb- stavros s niarchos -rrb- in the canaries last week and i climbed to the top of the 45 metre mast to raise money for comic relief .

gareth , cardiff , wales i will be manning the donation lines for the night dan tremain , bromley as i work for one of the big companies that are allegedly hijacking comic relief to boost sales i will be manning the donation lines for the night .
dan tremain , bromley i am amazed that some people are writing in saying that they are ' charitied out ' .
i agree that we ca n't all keep giving to all the good causes out there , but that does n't mean we have to lose our compassion for those less fortunate both at home and abroad .
for the sake of £ 1 for a red nose -lrb- whether you wear it or not -rrb- you can add that little drop to the ocean .
if everyone in the uk bought a £ 1 red nose - it would raise £ 55 million - and that would go a very , very long way ...
clare , scotland a couple of teams from within our youth football club staged an rnd benefit match last weekend and raised £ 78 .
we hope to top that up towards the end of the month when we are staging a second benefit game for the red nose cause .
chris cox , fawley falcons youth f.c , southampton , uk the snide and selfish attitudes expressed by many here will be enough to make me take part .
peter , birmingham so far we have raised over £ 200 jo , birmingham my company is having a dress down day .
so far we have raised over £ 200 .
i can not believe some of these comments .
i would like to think that if the table was turned , africa would help us out .
i realise that people have probably given to the tsunami appeal , but africa still needs our help , as do the hundreds of charities in the uk who benefit .
stop being such kill joys ! !
jo , birmingham red clothes , red lipstick , red hair - cakes , quizzes and fun !
fiona , tina , cath , jill and louise , dundee , uk severn trent telephone room girls have brought jelly beans , put them into a pot and the other employees have to guess how many to win a bottle of bubbly .
we are also doing the sweepstake , of course wearing red noses and red hair .
mel halligan , birmingham , england well what happened to good old fashioned humour ?
i turned up for work in a spacesuit for red nose day , only to be told by my boss to ' sort myself out ' .
it 's no wonder so many people have stress related sick days .
tony , derby 4 of us are wearing wigs and generally having a laugh .
julie , glasgow , scotland i 've got the red gel in my hair , face paint on my face and my red nose hanging round my neck - and a big comic relief bucket by my desk for donations !

happy red nose day .
hannah , bedfordshire coming from the states , where the most organised charity appeal is the rather pathetic jerry lewis telethon , red nose day is a real treat and a great way to get people involved in giving to those less fortunate .
my daughter 's school has a full day of activities planned and i 've sent her off with a sack of pound coins to give away .
as for me , i 'll hitch my red nose to my bike basket and later this evening , tune into fame academy .
lisa , cambridge hopefully we can do our bit sandy , cambridgeshire the vets and nurses at the broadway vet hospital are wearing pyjamas and dressing gowns for the day - and it 's cold .
hopefully we can do our bit , we have our mascot molly the terrier here as well .
sandy , cambridgeshire my son 's school is getting them all to come in dressed in something red , and he 's got a mad ' barnett ' for the day too .
he 's been so excited about wearing this all week , i thought we 'd never get to friday !
fair play to the headmaster , he 's always up for anything which helps the children to get a perspective on the real world , and let 's face it the world is bonkers !
eoin , cornwall , uk please try to sell red noses etc through more outlets next time .
we do not have a sainsbury or oxfam shop locally and when i tried to buy goods over the net they were all sold out .
sue sorrell , blackburn , england our office for the first time ever celebrated red nose day and the girls made rolls and bacon and rolls and sausage - total £ 80 .

alison , broadstairs , uk myself and my colleagues are taking phone pledges until midnight .

yes we do have a lot of charities looking for our support , but is n't this a fun way of helping others .
go on dye your hair , have a laugh , at least we in this country are free to do these things if we wish .
lesley smart , carluke , scotland i bought the little britain dvd and have donated some money for cakes that someone 's kindly brought in !
paul , milton keynes we 're doing hair spraying , head shaving , and running a mega raffle with prizes including : win a mini for a week .
nottingham panthers players coming down at 1pm .
the cornerhouse in nottingham , nottingham , england it 's one day of the year that we should all support martin , brighton , uk i can not believe the attitude of some people .
it may be a little bit wacky but it 's one day of the year that we should all support , from our nice warm homes .
martin , brighton , uk comic relief would be great if only my school would allow us to do something .
we are not allowed to dye our hair red or put face paint on or even wear non-uniform .
louisa , reading , uk for me , comic relief has been hijacked by big retail companies who are more interested in boosting sales than donating to charities , and if the tv coverage follows the style of recent years it will be 80 % embarrassing , 10 % guilt and 10 % watchable entertainment .
jon dalladay , london , uk holding the ' great red nose bake-off ' .
talented colleagues bake cakes and every one pays £ 1 to eat them and vote on the best .
a great excuse to eat cake on a friday afternoon .
kirsten , glasgow i 've bought the little britain dvd and that 's it .
i 'm fed up of red nose day and children in need and their ilk .
i give to various charities on a regular basis .
i do n't need what is essentially lazy television scheduling to try to persuade me to give more .
ian , leeds i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume rs , glasgow uk i will be aggressively rattling a tin , while wearing a funny costume and trying to make miserable old scrooges realise that living in one of the richest countries in the world carries responsibilities to ones fellow man .
oh , and making people feel guilty too .
rs , glasgow uk how much do we need to donate to keep ruby wax and robbie williams off our tvs ?
philippe , london , uk colouring my hair red , putting on a nose and a big smile and waiting for little britain 's comic relief special !
christine , uk while people may be tired of red nose day -lrb- and i am too , in fact i was never into it when it first came out -rrb- , i am dismayed at some of the comments here .
i may not like red nose day , but i do enjoy giving and helping out groups and charities of my choice , i am certainly not all charitied out .
the voluntary sector makes a massive difference to peoples lives locally , nationally and internationally and these hard working charities need out support .
if all charities were to disappear tomorrow we would soon know about it and the world would be much worse place .
it 's very easy to moan about giving from the comfort of your own laptop , having had the luck to be born in the west .
some people at my university are selling cookies for red nose day tomorrow , i will buy some of those and offload my small change to anyone with a collection box , it all helps .
i am glad that at least some people here are going all out in their fund raising efforts and wish them all the best , it 's good to see some charity and community spirit exists around here .
amy , colchester they should do what they did the other year .
every hour they picked someone who donated on the phone and they won vip tickets to a football match .
i feel more people would give if they felt they had a chance of winning something .
chris h , lincoln i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it alex young , grantham , lincs i 'm doing nothing .
i think there are so many fund raising events that it takes the fun out of it .
children in need should give it a rest for a few years .
it 's not that i 'm not a giving person , i give money to the odd charity now and then .
there should be a rnli day that is a charity that really needs the public donations .
alex young , grantham , lincs we have finally managed to persuade our school to have a non uniform day , and several people are shaving their hair off .
unfortunately , there does n't seem to be any red noses around where i live , otherwise i 'd buy one .
emily , cumbria , uk what am i doing ?
absolutely nothing .
i have charity fatigue and resent other people trying to make me feel guilty for not joining in days and days of begging by tin-rattlers , topped off by hours of unfunny ' comedy ' sketches .
if i want to give to charity , i will .
in my own time and not because it is pc to do so .
i hesitate to mention this as discretion is the better part of valour , but i do voluntary work , i just do n't feel the need to advertise the details of my deeds -lrb- or donations -rrb- on television .
nichola feeney , dundee , scotland i have decided to boycott comic relief this year and donate my money to other charities instead .
it was not a decision i made lightly , but the fact that this year 's theme is the same as last year 's , and the general coverage , has persuaded me that all anyone cares about anymore is celebrities mucking around in funny hairdos .
actually helping the disadvantaged seems like some sort of side issue .
r potter , cambridge , uk this time red nose will get nothing from me bumble , dartford , uk with so many charities chasing donation 's , is it little wonder that sooner or later we will all get charity fatigue .
so this time red nose will get nothing from me .
bumble , dartford , uk i will be out celebrating my birthday - probably wearing nothing but a hairy red nose !
rachel , ipswich , uk anyone see the episode of the office where they have red nose day ?
i am with tim - work 's idea of " wackiness " does n't really do it for me , but i will donate .
fraser , essex , england i will give some money and then go out instead of watching self-publicising celebrities prance about on tv .
it seems a coincidence to me that they 're so happy to give up their time when they have a book / musical / tv show to promote .
julie , brighton , england when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term paul , london i 'll be writing to my mp demanding that gordon brown keeps to his commitments to long term aid for the third world .
sorry to be a misery but comic relief money is a drop in the ocean and i find something obscene in multi-million salaried celebrities showing footage of starving children whilst being happy and nice and we all feel guilty , give some cash , pat ourselves on the back and feel like generally nice folk .
please people , when you 've enjoyed the show do some homework into how to help to solve the problems in the long term - comic relief will solve them for a fraction of the sufferers for a day .
paul , london ignoring it completely .
i give to the charities of my choice , not the charities i 'm told to give to by celebrities who " give their time for free " -lrb- read : gain some free self-publicity and tell me to open my wallet without opening their own -rrb- john b , uk money from appeals like this is sent to these people in order to help themselves -lrb- the presenters take great pains in telling us that all they want is to help themselves -rrb- .
the question is " why are these people still in need of such help after 20 years of red nose day ? " .
if this is all they want , i find it hard to believe that it would take 20 years .
i heard billy connolly try to shame us into believing that " compassion fatigue " is a myth , but after 20 years of donating and seeing no change in their situation , it is indeed a very real thing !
paul , nottingham , uk red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off william read , staffordshire nothing .
it is well past its sell by date , and the sooner it is put out of its misery the better .
red nose day has become just another commercial rip-off .
william read , stafford , staffordshire maybe i 'm selfish , but i do n't see the point in donating money abroad when we have our own problems to deal with , such as homelessness on our streets .
this has been going on for 20 years yet the same problems still exist abroad , i do n't think throwing some cash at them every year will ever solve it .
ed , ayrshire i have already done my bit by donating .
on the night i will be avoiding the tv screen at all costs .
the very thought of watching more than two minutes of ' comedians ' lenny henry , liza tarbuck and dawn french brings me out in hives .
leon , brighouse , uk will the public dig deep again ?
maybe the tsunami appeal has taken the country 's generosity ! come on people africa needs aid too !
dean chambers , castleford , uk the same as every year - buying a bottle of wine and watching films .
whilst i support charity , i want to choose those i support and do not want it rammed down my throat .
carolyn , england sorry , but i 'm all charity 'd out and wo n't watching or donating this year .
j , oxford it has created a real buzz around the office kiltie , staffs , uk we have managed to persuade our very staid company to allow us to have a fancy dress fun day .
we are having a fete theme with tombola stall , name the elephant , raffle , guess the babies plus prizes for the best and worst outfits .
staff are also doing their own little bits - ie two ladies are dressing as saloon girls and if they raise fifty pounds by 1pm they will go to tesco 's in their outfits to buy their lunch !
it has created a real buzz around the office and has been the only topic of conversation all day .
we ca n't wait ! ! !
kiltie , staffs , uk i wo n't be doing anything for red nose day as my work is relocating the following day and we have to pack away last minute things and help the removal men .
as for watching it , i find it the most pointless 6/7 hours and would rather be playing board games .
charity does not need blanket tv coverage .
by the way i have donated £ 10 to comic relief .
helen , leeds what will i be doing ?
doing my best to avoid aggressive tin-rattlers dressed in ridiculous costumes who will be doing their best to make me feel guilty , and failing miserably .
trevor , cambs , uk our office is going all out for red nose day , from sponsoring members of staff to dress up as cartoon characters to spot the red hairdo on our intranet .
not everyone is taking an active part , but everyone is giving something .
if everyone was a moany old skinflint like trevor there would n't be anyone left alive in third world countries !
cheer up it 's for a good cause !
kelly , edinburgh , scotland absolutely nothing apart from trying to avoid the irritating tin shakers on my way home in the evening .
i give to the charities i choose to , not the ones that have big enough budgets to try and guilt trip people into giving them money with footage of starving orphans .
