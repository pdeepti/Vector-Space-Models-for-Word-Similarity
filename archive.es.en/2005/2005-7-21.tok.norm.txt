although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved .

merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved . " overwhelming domestic issues the importance of the domestic agenda , however , has increased the chances of angela merkel becoming germany 's first woman chancellor .
the latest opinion poll gave her conservative christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has every reason to be optimistic about the upcoming elections merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment rate and inject new life into the euro zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy .
merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .
recently , however , she has been increasingly vociferous about criticizing the social democrats for hurting us - german relations . desperation ? " i do get the impression that schröder and the spd are trying to make the old iraq debate an election issue again , " said wolfgang schäuble , a foreign policy expert for the cdu . " that is above all a sign they are desperate and lack good , forward-looking arguments for why people should vote for them , " he said . according to manfred güllner , director of the forsa polling institute , it would be , indeed , very difficult for schröder to play the iraq card again .

nothing unusual there .
but in this case , the woman was clad in an unbuttoned jeans jacket and nothing else .
and although germans are famously tolerant of nudity , officials said they could have arrested her for disturbing the peace .
but they did not . " we are a tolerant city , " police spokesman berkard jahn told reuters .
" we decided to let her go home with a verbal warning to dress appropriately next time . "
he said that decision was made because few people and presumably no small children saw her at that time of the day .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved .

merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .
recently , however , she has been increasingly vociferous about criticizing the social democrats for hurting us - german relations . desperation ? " i do get the impression that schröder and the spd are trying to make the old iraq debate an election issue again , " said wolfgang schäuble , a foreign policy expert for the cdu .

more than 30 tremors have been recorded beneath the hochstaufen mountain in bavaria since friday , most of which will not have been noticed by residents , according to the ministry .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved . " overwhelming domestic issues the importance of the domestic agenda , however , has increased the chances of angela merkel becoming germany 's first woman chancellor .
the latest opinion poll gave her conservative christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has every reason to be optimistic about the upcoming elections merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment rate and inject new life into the euro zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy .
merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .
recently , however , she has been increasingly vociferous about criticizing the social democrats for hurting us - german relations . desperation ? " i do get the impression that schröder and the spd are trying to make the old iraq debate an election issue again , " said wolfgang schäuble , a foreign policy expert for the cdu . " that is above all a sign they are desperate and lack good , forward-looking arguments for why people should vote for them , " he said . according to manfred güllner , director of the forsa polling institute , it would be , indeed , very difficult for schröder to play the iraq card again . " he will try to present his iraq policy as one of his accomplishments , but i do n't believe it will be a big plus this time , " güllner told reuters . " the war has already happened .

" we know that we had four explosions or attempted explosions simultaneously , " london police chief ian blair told reporters .
" at the moment the casualties appear to be very low in the explosions .
the bombs appear to be smaller than on the last occasion .
we do n't know the implications for this yet - clearly this is a very serious incident . " dozens of police and fire engines scrambled to the scenes , evacuating three subway stations and cordoning off a wide area in eastern london around a double-decker bus in which the upper-floor windows were blown out . police said they had sent armed officers to investigate an " incident " at university college hospital in central london .
a spokesman was unable to confirm reports on sky news about a man with a device with protruding wires attached to him seen in the area of the hospital .
police said the incident had been contained without providing further details . a city already traumatized stations at oval in southern london , warren street to the north and shepherd 's bush to the west were evacuated .
police said initial investigations of warren street and oval stations found no sign of chemical agents . four subway lines were temporarily shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copycat or same group ?

" it was difficult to get the story from any of them what had happened but when i got to ground level there was an italian young man comforting an italian girl who told me he had seen what had happened .
he said that a man was carrying a rucksack and the rucksack suddenly exploded .
it was a minor explosion but enough to blow open the rucksack .
the man then made an exclamation as if something had gone wrong .
at that point everyone rushed from the carriage . " " i could just smell smoke " another witness , abena adofo , 23 , told afp that people were running into her carriage .
" i could just smell smoke and i saw lots of people panicking , " she said .
" i was just trying to be calm and get out .
the smell of smoke was coming from the end of the carriage . " stagecoach , which owns the number 26 bus involved in the incident , said the driver heard a bang at around 12:30 p.m.
london time . the bus had left waterloo and was in the shoreditch neighborhood when the incident happened . " the driver heard a bang which appeared to come from the upper deck , " a spokesman told afp .
" when he went upstairs to investigate , the windows on the upper deck were blown out .
the bus is structurally intact and we do n't have any reports of injuries . " british prime minister tony blair urged the public to stay calm . " we know why these things are done - they are done to scare people , " he told reporters .
" fortunately , in this instance , there appear to have been no casualties ...

" at the moment the casualties appear to be very low in the explosions .
the bombs appear to be smaller than on the last occasion .
we do n't know the implications for this yet - clearly this is a very serious incident .

he said that a man was carrying a rucksack and the rucksack suddenly exploded .
it was a minor explosion but enough to blow open the rucksack .
the man then made an exclamation as if something had gone wrong .
at that point everyone rushed from the carriage . " " i could just smell smoke " another witness , abena adofo , 23 , told afp that people were running into her carriage .
" i could just smell smoke and i saw lots of people panicking , " she said .
" i was just trying to be calm and get out .
the smell of smoke was coming from the end of the carriage . " stagecoach , which owns the number 26 bus involved in the incident , said the driver heard a bang at around 12:30 p.m.
london time . the bus had left waterloo and was in the shoreditch neighborhood when the incident happened . " the driver heard a bang which appeared to come from the upper deck , " a spokesman told afp .
" when he went upstairs to investigate , the windows on the upper deck were blown out .
the bus is structurally intact and we do n't have any reports of injuries . " british prime minister tony blair urged the public to stay calm . " we know why these things are done - they are done to scare people , " he told reporters .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .

" president horst köhler will address citizens in a televised speech from this evening at 8.15 pm -lrb- 1815 gmt -rrb- to announce and explain his decision on the chancellor 's proposal based on article 68 of the constitution , " köhler 's office said in a statement . köhler 's decision will come one day before his constitutionally mandated deadline , exactly three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary vote of confidence with the aim of prompting elections one year ahead of schedule . the german press and the majority of analysts are predicting that köhler will give the go-ahead for elections , probably to take place on september 18 .
new elections must take place within 60 days of the dissolution of the parliament . yet , despite the clear vote of no confidence , which the ruling coalition received in the parliament , köhler is entitled to make his own decision whether to dissolve the parliament or not . not a done deal " it is outrageous how all the parties are behaving as if the election were already a done deal , " said wolf-rüdiger schenke , lawyer representing the green party legislator werner schulz . if köhler gives a go-ahead to the new elections , several members of the parliament , including schulz , intend to take the issue to the federal constitutional court .
the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of no confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court may have to rule on the legality of new elections the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , had lead to the rise of adolf hitler . constitutional difficulties president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , however , does not believe that the current misuse of the confidence vote mechanism is the best solution for calling early elections . " i believe we should change it , " said thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliamentarians should be able to fire themeselves , according to wolfgang thierse according to thierse , the parliament ought to be able to dissolve itself , without the intervention of the president of the republic .
as an additional security measure , one could require a 2/3 or 3/4 majority for the motion to be passed . " one should n't be changing the constitution in a haphazard sort of way , " thierse said , hoping that the issue would be raised and discussed in the next legislative period . when asked about how he felt about the current situation and the upcoming decision by president köhler , thierse replied he was " not really nervous . " thierse stressed , however , that president köhler was free to make his own decision .
" he can even decide against the country 's mood , " thierse said . eager for early elections the country is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
83 percent germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , but 76 precent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder 's letter asking the parliament for a vote of confidence schröder has been undermined by a series of poor performances for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in state polls and says he needs to know if the electorate still backs a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms he has already begun to introduce . in an impassioned speech before the vote of confidence on july 1 , schröder said he was seeking new elections because the question arose whether " my policies and i are still fully able to function " . no backing ? immediately afterwards , he went to president köhler , asking him to bring the election forward .
seeking guidance in his decision , köhler asked schröder to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier his spokesman bela anda said provided " a documentation of the difficulties of implementing his government program . "
it included dozens of newspaper articles describing the malaise within the government and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics within the ruling coalition of spd and greens . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance known as the left party which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery dw-world looks at the constitutional aspects of the early elections that have led some to cry foul and others to praise the county 's electoral system .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .
merkel 's position was echoed by french interior miniters nicolas sarkozy . " after the failures of the referendums -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- in france and the netherlands , we need to start worrying about europe 's future .
we need to talk about the limits of future enlargement .
we need borders .
people have to know where the borders are , " merkel said . merkel is expected to become german chancellor in an early election this fall and sarkozy is widely tipped to become french president in two years ' time . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .
merkel 's position was echoed by french interior miniters nicolas sarkozy . " after the failures of the referendums -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- in france and the netherlands , we need to start worrying about europe 's future .
we need to talk about the limits of future enlargement .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities .
-lrb- july 15 , 2005 -rrb- nazi jibes a recipe for disaster german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

what other legislation is essential for streamlining immigration and making integration of foreigners easier ? the immigration law that we have is n't the best , but it does make things simpler in some aspects .
what 's crucial , however , is for germany to implement an anti-discrimination law according to european regulations - though that may become tougher under a conservative government .
germany also needs to humanize its current policy on refugees , which unfortunately has become an eu standard now . also , very importantly , we need to offer illegal immigrants the chance to legalize themselves - something that 's even possible under berlusconi in italy .
talking about illegal persons in germany is a huge taboo - which just shows how loaded the issue is .
we definitely need to improve on regulations for illegal immigrants as well as for refugees and asylum-seekers . one of the enduring images broadcast around the world during the 60th anniversary of world war ii was of a massive demonstration against a planned neo-nazi march in downtown berlin .

counter demonstrations - whether it 's by the far-left or by the middle class in germany - seldom lead to a solution or a new stance of solidarity .
it would be better if people were more considerate of others rather than taking to the streets with candles and slogans .
of course , sometimes you need them to show far-right groups that there are limits .
and i do n't think that there are counter demonstrations to neo-nazis groups everywhere in germany . if one wants to really show solidarity with racial minorities then one has to treat them with respect and interest - something that happens much too rarely in everyday life in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 köhler to make election announcement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler had till friday to decide if elections were called for german president horst köhler will announce late thursday whether he will dissolve parliament to pave the way for an early general election this fall after chancellor gerhard schröder purposely lost a confidence vote . " president horst köhler will address citizens in a televised speech from this evening at 8.15 pm -lrb- 1815 gmt -rrb- to announce and explain his decision on the chancellor 's proposal based on article 68 of the constitution , " köhler 's office said in a statement . köhler 's decision will come one day before his constitutionally mandated deadline , exactly three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary vote of confidence with the aim of prompting elections one year ahead of schedule . the german press and the majority of analysts are predicting that köhler will give the go-ahead for elections , probably to take place on september 18 .
new elections must take place within 60 days of the dissolution of the parliament . yet , despite the clear vote of no confidence , which the ruling coalition received in the parliament , köhler is entitled to make his own decision whether to dissolve the parliament or not . not a done deal " it is outrageous how all the parties are behaving as if the election were already a done deal , " said wolf-rüdiger schenke , lawyer representing the green party legislator werner schulz . if köhler gives a go-ahead to the new elections , several members of the parliament , including schulz , intend to take the issue to the federal constitutional court .
the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of no confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court may have to rule on the legality of new elections the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , had lead to the rise of adolf hitler . constitutional difficulties president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , however , does not believe that the current misuse of the confidence vote mechanism is the best solution for calling early elections . " i believe we should change it , " said thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliamentarians should be able to fire themeselves , according to wolfgang thierse according to thierse , the parliament ought to be able to dissolve itself , without the intervention of the president of the republic .
as an additional security measure , one could require a 2/3 or 3/4 majority for the motion to be passed . " one should n't be changing the constitution in a haphazard sort of way , " thierse said , hoping that the issue would be raised and discussed in the next legislative period . when asked about how he felt about the current situation and the upcoming decision by president köhler , thierse replied he was " not really nervous . " thierse stressed , however , that president köhler was free to make his own decision .
" he can even decide against the country 's mood , " thierse said . eager for early elections the country is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
83 percent germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , but 76 precent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder 's letter asking the parliament for a vote of confidence schröder has been undermined by a series of poor performances for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in state polls and says he needs to know if the electorate still backs a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms he has already begun to introduce . in an impassioned speech before the vote of confidence on july 1 , schröder said he was seeking new elections because the question arose whether " my policies and i are still fully able to function " . no backing ? immediately afterwards , he went to president köhler , asking him to bring the election forward .
seeking guidance in his decision , köhler asked schröder to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier his spokesman bela anda said provided " a documentation of the difficulties of implementing his government program . "
it included dozens of newspaper articles describing the malaise within the government and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics within the ruling coalition of spd and greens . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance known as the left party which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery dw-world looks at the constitutional aspects of the early elections that have led some to cry foul and others to praise the county 's electoral system .
election decision day looms for germany the deadline for president horst köhler to decide whether or not to approve new federal elections is this friday .
should he surprise everyone with a no vote , the chancellor plans to continue to govern .
-lrb- july 18 , 2005 -rrb- early german elections in legal limbo germany 's ruling coalition may have purposely lost a confidence vote to trigger early elections , but the country 's president or supreme court could yet kibosh the hopes of both politicians and the public for a new poll .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism back to first page back 2/2 germany finally has an immigration law .
what other legislation is essential for streamlining immigration and making integration of foreigners easier ? the immigration law that we have is n't the best , but it does make things simpler in some aspects .
what 's crucial , however , is for germany to implement an anti-discrimination law according to european regulations - though that may become tougher under a conservative government .
germany also needs to humanize its current policy on refugees , which unfortunately has become an eu standard now . also , very importantly , we need to offer illegal immigrants the chance to legalize themselves - something that 's even possible under berlusconi in italy .
talking about illegal persons in germany is a huge taboo - which just shows how loaded the issue is .
we definitely need to improve on regulations for illegal immigrants as well as for refugees and asylum-seekers . one of the enduring images broadcast around the world during the 60th anniversary of world war ii was of a massive demonstration against a planned neo-nazi march in downtown berlin .
is n't it an encouraging sign that ordinary germans take to the streets to counter neo-nazis and send a signal against hate and racism ? # b # an anti-attitude or just being against something is n't an answer .
counter demonstrations - whether it 's by the far-left or by the middle class in germany - seldom lead to a solution or a new stance of solidarity .
it would be better if people were more considerate of others rather than taking to the streets with candles and slogans .
of course , sometimes you need them to show far-right groups that there are limits .
and i do n't think that there are counter demonstrations to neo-nazis groups everywhere in germany . if one wants to really show solidarity with racial minorities then one has to treat them with respect and interest - something that happens much too rarely in everyday life in germany .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

" we know that we had four explosions or attempted explosions simultaneously , " london police chief ian blair told reporters .
" at the moment the casualties appear to be very low in the explosions .
the bombs appear to be smaller than on the last occasion .
we do n't know the implications for this yet - clearly this is a very serious incident . " dozens of police and fire engines scrambled to the scenes , evacuating three subway stations and cordoning off a wide area in eastern london around a double-decker bus in which the upper-floor windows were blown out . police said they had sent armed officers to investigate an " incident " at university college hospital in central london .
a spokesman was unable to confirm reports on sky news about a man with a device with protruding wires attached to him seen in the area of the hospital .
police said the incident had been contained without providing further details . a city already traumatized stations at oval in southern london , warren street to the north and shepherd 's bush to the west were evacuated .
police said initial investigations of warren street and oval stations found no sign of chemical agents . four subway lines were temporarily shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copycat or same group ?
the blasts hit a city traumatized by the july 7 attacks , in which 56 people were killed including four suspected al-qaeda suicide bombers who blew up three subway trains and a double-decker bus . chaos , panic , witnesses say back on the streets , passengers who had fled the trains reported panic and chaos below ground . victoria line passenger ivan mccracken said he heard a traveler 's backpack had exploded on the subway outside warren street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosions two weeks ago were much more powerful , police officials said " i was in a middle carriage and the train was not far short of warren street station when suddenly the door between my carriage and the next one burst open and dozens of people started rushing through , some were falling and there was mass panic , " he told sky news . " it was difficult to get the story from any of them what had happened but when i got to ground level there was an italian young man comforting an italian girl who told me he had seen what had happened .
he said that a man was carrying a rucksack and the rucksack suddenly exploded .
it was a minor explosion but enough to blow open the rucksack .
the man then made an exclamation as if something had gone wrong .
at that point everyone rushed from the carriage . " " i could just smell smoke " another witness , abena adofo , 23 , told afp that people were running into her carriage .
" i could just smell smoke and i saw lots of people panicking , " she said .
" i was just trying to be calm and get out .
the smell of smoke was coming from the end of the carriage . " stagecoach , which owns the number 26 bus involved in the incident , said the driver heard a bang at around 12:30 p.m.
london time . the bus had left waterloo and was in the shoreditch neighborhood when the incident happened . " the driver heard a bang which appeared to come from the upper deck , " a spokesman told afp .
" when he went upstairs to investigate , the windows on the upper deck were blown out .
the bus is structurally intact and we do n't have any reports of injuries . " british prime minister tony blair urged the public to stay calm . " we know why these things are done - they are done to scare people , " he told reporters .
" fortunately , in this instance , there appear to have been no casualties ...

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved .

merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .

ever since the german defense minister accused the iranian president of having been involved in terrorist activities , the diplomatic exchange between berlin and tehran has taken an unusually acrimonious tone . in an interview for the german weekly der spiegel , published monday , the german interior minister otto schily expressed his concern about " a fundamentalist coming to power in tehran . "
he was referring to mahmoud ahmadinejad , who was elected president of iran on june 24 . " we ca n't be certain that he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- has absolutely distanced himself from terrorism , " schily said . the spokesperson of the iranian ministry of foreign affairs , hamid resa asefi , responded to schily 's criticism of the iranian president by calling it " unfounded and laughable " and advising the german minister " to express himself more carefully , get rid of the influence of zionist circles and respect democratic principles . " berlin strikes back in a rebuttal from the german ministry of the interior , rainer lingenstahl , the ministry spokesperson , referred to his iranian colleague 's statements on wednesday as " unbelievable outrageousness . " " it would be difficult to surpass the effrontery of such a voice from a country in which human rights are constantly abused , in which women are flogged as a consequence of dubious sentences , and in which critics of the regime , who have no access to legal support and appropriate legal procedures , are kept in isolation for months , " said lingenstahl .

" i have noticed that people are very enthusiastic that they will get the chance to meet someone from the organization , " beckenbauer said at a press conference in munich . some german newspapers have already baptised his visits as the " kaiser 's world tour " in reference to the 59-year-old 's nickname .
the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .
his completed journey of 120,000 kilometers will be the equivalent of three world tours in 50 days . though beckenbauer 's travels are meant to promote germany 's world cup efforts , they certainly wo n't hurt his campaign to become the next head of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe . beckenbauer and platini favorites current uefa president lennart johansson is set to step down in 2007 .
beckenbauer and france 's michel platini are the favorites to succeed the 75-year-old swede , who has headed uefa since 1990 .
johansson was giving a one-year extension in order to postpone the election to coincide with the vote for the next head of fifa , the organization that governs the sport worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele , franz beckenbauer , and the world cup mascot goleo .
brazil icon pele , fifa president sepp blatter and johansson have already given their backing for beckenbauer to become the next uefa president .
" franz achieves whatever he sets his mind to , " pele said in a newspaper interview in april .
" i think he is the right man for the uefa presidency .
platini wants the job too , but franz has more ambition . " platini , who is 10 years younger than beckenbauer , has come under fire for suggestions that could shake up european soccer .
he has said he would endeavour to help clubs keep their younger players , whom they have invested in from youth level , and change the champions league format . as expected , the kaiser also has the backing of his colleagues at bayern munich , where his is currently the club 's president .
" michel platini has a crazy revolution at the back of his mind , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge said in may .
" beckenbauer values football traditions and will keep the game going in the right direction . " dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no world cup party for berlin ?

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .

the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .

gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice .

what 's crucial , however , is for germany to implement an anti-discrimination law according to european regulations - though that may become tougher under a conservative government .
germany also needs to humanize its current policy on refugees , which unfortunately has become an eu standard now . also , very importantly , we need to offer illegal immigrants the chance to legalize themselves - something that 's even possible under berlusconi in italy .
talking about illegal persons in germany is a huge taboo - which just shows how loaded the issue is .
we definitely need to improve on regulations for illegal immigrants as well as for refugees and asylum-seekers . one of the enduring images broadcast around the world during the 60th anniversary of world war ii was of a massive demonstration against a planned neo-nazi march in downtown berlin .
is n't it an encouraging sign that ordinary germans take to the streets to counter neo-nazis and send a signal against hate and racism ? # b # an anti-attitude or just being against something is n't an answer .
counter demonstrations - whether it 's by the far-left or by the middle class in germany - seldom lead to a solution or a new stance of solidarity .
it would be better if people were more considerate of others rather than taking to the streets with candles and slogans .
of course , sometimes you need them to show far-right groups that there are limits .
and i do n't think that there are counter demonstrations to neo-nazis groups everywhere in germany . if one wants to really show solidarity with racial minorities then one has to treat them with respect and interest - something that happens much too rarely in everyday life in germany .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

" we know that we had four explosions or attempted explosions simultaneously , " london police chief ian blair told reporters .
" at the moment the casualties appear to be very low in the explosions .
the bombs appear to be smaller than on the last occasion .
we do n't know the implications for this yet - clearly this is a very serious incident . " dozens of police and fire engines scrambled to the scenes , evacuating three subway stations and cordoning off a wide area in eastern london around a double-decker bus in which the upper-floor windows were blown out . police said they had sent armed officers to investigate an " incident " at university college hospital in central london .
a spokesman was unable to confirm reports on sky news about a man with a device with protruding wires attached to him seen in the area of the hospital .
police said the incident had been contained without providing further details . a city already traumatized stations at oval in southern london , warren street to the north and shepherd 's bush to the west were evacuated .
police said initial investigations of warren street and oval stations found no sign of chemical agents . four subway lines were temporarily shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copycat or same group ?
the blasts hit a city traumatized by the july 7 attacks , in which 56 people were killed including four suspected al-qaeda suicide bombers who blew up three subway trains and a double-decker bus . chaos , panic , witnesses say back on the streets , passengers who had fled the trains reported panic and chaos below ground . victoria line passenger ivan mccracken said he heard a traveler 's backpack had exploded on the subway outside warren street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosions two weeks ago were much more powerful , police officials said " i was in a middle carriage and the train was not far short of warren street station when suddenly the door between my carriage and the next one burst open and dozens of people started rushing through , some were falling and there was mass panic , " he told sky news . " it was difficult to get the story from any of them what had happened but when i got to ground level there was an italian young man comforting an italian girl who told me he had seen what had happened .
he said that a man was carrying a rucksack and the rucksack suddenly exploded .
it was a minor explosion but enough to blow open the rucksack .
the man then made an exclamation as if something had gone wrong .
at that point everyone rushed from the carriage . " " i could just smell smoke " another witness , abena adofo , 23 , told afp that people were running into her carriage .
" i could just smell smoke and i saw lots of people panicking , " she said .
" i was just trying to be calm and get out .
the smell of smoke was coming from the end of the carriage . " stagecoach , which owns the number 26 bus involved in the incident , said the driver heard a bang at around 12:30 p.m.
london time . the bus had left waterloo and was in the shoreditch neighborhood when the incident happened . " the driver heard a bang which appeared to come from the upper deck , " a spokesman told afp .
" when he went upstairs to investigate , the windows on the upper deck were blown out .
the bus is structurally intact and we do n't have any reports of injuries . " british prime minister tony blair urged the public to stay calm . " we know why these things are done - they are done to scare people , " he told reporters .

" president horst köhler will address citizens in a televised speech from this evening at 8.15 pm -lrb- 1815 gmt -rrb- to announce and explain his decision on the chancellor 's proposal based on article 68 of the constitution , " köhler 's office said in a statement . köhler 's decision will come one day before his constitutionally mandated deadline , exactly three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary vote of confidence with the aim of prompting elections one year ahead of schedule . the german press and the majority of analysts are predicting that köhler will give the go-ahead for elections , probably to take place on september 18 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election issues : what 's at stake a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism back to first page back 2/2 germany finally has an immigration law .
what other legislation is essential for streamlining immigration and making integration of foreigners easier ? the immigration law that we have is n't the best , but it does make things simpler in some aspects .
what 's crucial , however , is for germany to implement an anti-discrimination law according to european regulations - though that may become tougher under a conservative government .
germany also needs to humanize its current policy on refugees , which unfortunately has become an eu standard now . also , very importantly , we need to offer illegal immigrants the chance to legalize themselves - something that 's even possible under berlusconi in italy .
talking about illegal persons in germany is a huge taboo - which just shows how loaded the issue is .
we definitely need to improve on regulations for illegal immigrants as well as for refugees and asylum-seekers . one of the enduring images broadcast around the world during the 60th anniversary of world war ii was of a massive demonstration against a planned neo-nazi march in downtown berlin .
is n't it an encouraging sign that ordinary germans take to the streets to counter neo-nazis and send a signal against hate and racism ? # b # an anti-attitude or just being against something is n't an answer .
counter demonstrations - whether it 's by the far-left or by the middle class in germany - seldom lead to a solution or a new stance of solidarity .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism back to first page back 2/2 germany finally has an immigration law .
what other legislation is essential for streamlining immigration and making integration of foreigners easier ? the immigration law that we have is n't the best , but it does make things simpler in some aspects .
what 's crucial , however , is for germany to implement an anti-discrimination law according to european regulations - though that may become tougher under a conservative government .
germany also needs to humanize its current policy on refugees , which unfortunately has become an eu standard now . also , very importantly , we need to offer illegal immigrants the chance to legalize themselves - something that 's even possible under berlusconi in italy .
talking about illegal persons in germany is a huge taboo - which just shows how loaded the issue is .
we definitely need to improve on regulations for illegal immigrants as well as for refugees and asylum-seekers . one of the enduring images broadcast around the world during the 60th anniversary of world war ii was of a massive demonstration against a planned neo-nazi march in downtown berlin .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

" we know that we had four explosions or attempted explosions simultaneously , " london police chief ian blair told reporters .
" at the moment the casualties appear to be very low in the explosions .
the bombs appear to be smaller than on the last occasion .
we do n't know the implications for this yet - clearly this is a very serious incident . " dozens of police and fire engines scrambled to the scenes , evacuating three subway stations and cordoning off a wide area in eastern london around a double-decker bus in which the upper-floor windows were blown out . police said they had sent armed officers to investigate an " incident " at university college hospital in central london .
a spokesman was unable to confirm reports on sky news about a man with a device with protruding wires attached to him seen in the area of the hospital .
police said the incident had been contained without providing further details . a city already traumatized stations at oval in southern london , warren street to the north and shepherd 's bush to the west were evacuated .
police said initial investigations of warren street and oval stations found no sign of chemical agents . four subway lines were temporarily shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copycat or same group ?
the blasts hit a city traumatized by the july 7 attacks , in which 56 people were killed including four suspected al-qaeda suicide bombers who blew up three subway trains and a double-decker bus . chaos , panic , witnesses say back on the streets , passengers who had fled the trains reported panic and chaos below ground . victoria line passenger ivan mccracken said he heard a traveler 's backpack had exploded on the subway outside warren street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosions two weeks ago were much more powerful , police officials said " i was in a middle carriage and the train was not far short of warren street station when suddenly the door between my carriage and the next one burst open and dozens of people started rushing through , some were falling and there was mass panic , " he told sky news . " it was difficult to get the story from any of them what had happened but when i got to ground level there was an italian young man comforting an italian girl who told me he had seen what had happened .
he said that a man was carrying a rucksack and the rucksack suddenly exploded .
it was a minor explosion but enough to blow open the rucksack .
the man then made an exclamation as if something had gone wrong .
at that point everyone rushed from the carriage . " " i could just smell smoke " another witness , abena adofo , 23 , told afp that people were running into her carriage .
" i could just smell smoke and i saw lots of people panicking , " she said .
" i was just trying to be calm and get out .
the smell of smoke was coming from the end of the carriage . " stagecoach , which owns the number 26 bus involved in the incident , said the driver heard a bang at around 12:30 p.m.
london time . the bus had left waterloo and was in the shoreditch neighborhood when the incident happened . " the driver heard a bang which appeared to come from the upper deck , " a spokesman told afp .
" when he went upstairs to investigate , the windows on the upper deck were blown out .
the bus is structurally intact and we do n't have any reports of injuries . " british prime minister tony blair urged the public to stay calm . " we know why these things are done - they are done to scare people , " he told reporters .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .
merkel 's position was echoed by french interior miniters nicolas sarkozy . " after the failures of the referendums -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- in france and the netherlands , we need to start worrying about europe 's future .
we need to talk about the limits of future enlargement .
we need borders .
people have to know where the borders are , " merkel said . merkel is expected to become german chancellor in an early election this fall and sarkozy is widely tipped to become french president in two years ' time . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .
merkel 's position was echoed by french interior miniters nicolas sarkozy . " after the failures of the referendums -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- in france and the netherlands , we need to start worrying about europe 's future .
we need to talk about the limits of future enlargement .
we need borders .
people have to know where the borders are , " merkel said . merkel is expected to become german chancellor in an early election this fall and sarkozy is widely tipped to become french president in two years ' time . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved .

merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .

the man then made an exclamation as if something had gone wrong .
at that point everyone rushed from the carriage . " " i could just smell smoke " another witness , abena adofo , 23 , told afp that people were running into her carriage .
" i could just smell smoke and i saw lots of people panicking , " she said .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities .
-lrb- july 15 , 2005 -rrb- nazi jibes a recipe for disaster german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ?

bavarian premier edmund stoiber threw a hot coal into the debate over right-wing extremism by blaming the government for the resurgence of radicals by allowing unemployment to hit levels not seen since the 1930s .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved . " overwhelming domestic issues the importance of the domestic agenda , however , has increased the chances of angela merkel becoming germany 's first woman chancellor .
the latest opinion poll gave her conservative christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has every reason to be optimistic about the upcoming elections merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment rate and inject new life into the euro zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy .
merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .
recently , however , she has been increasingly vociferous about criticizing the social democrats for hurting us - german relations . desperation ? " i do get the impression that schröder and the spd are trying to make the old iraq debate an election issue again , " said wolfgang schäuble , a foreign policy expert for the cdu . " that is above all a sign they are desperate and lack good , forward-looking arguments for why people should vote for them , " he said . according to manfred güllner , director of the forsa polling institute , it would be , indeed , very difficult for schröder to play the iraq card again . " he will try to present his iraq policy as one of his accomplishments , but i do n't believe it will be a big plus this time , " güllner told reuters . " the war has already happened .
it simply is n't the divisive issue it once was .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .
merkel 's position was echoed by french interior miniters nicolas sarkozy . " after the failures of the referendums -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- in france and the netherlands , we need to start worrying about europe 's future .
we need to talk about the limits of future enlargement .
we need borders .
people have to know where the borders are , " merkel said . merkel is expected to become german chancellor in an early election this fall and sarkozy is widely tipped to become french president in two years ' time . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

ever since the german defense minister accused the iranian president of having been involved in terrorist activities , the diplomatic exchange between berlin and tehran has taken an unusually acrimonious tone . in an interview for the german weekly der spiegel , published monday , the german interior minister otto schily expressed his concern about " a fundamentalist coming to power in tehran . "
he was referring to mahmoud ahmadinejad , who was elected president of iran on june 24 . " we ca n't be certain that he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- has absolutely distanced himself from terrorism , " schily said . the spokesperson of the iranian ministry of foreign affairs , hamid resa asefi , responded to schily 's criticism of the iranian president by calling it " unfounded and laughable " and advising the german minister " to express himself more carefully , get rid of the influence of zionist circles and respect democratic principles . " berlin strikes back in a rebuttal from the german ministry of the interior , rainer lingenstahl , the ministry spokesperson , referred to his iranian colleague 's statements on wednesday as " unbelievable outrageousness . " " it would be difficult to surpass the effrontery of such a voice from a country in which human rights are constantly abused , in which women are flogged as a consequence of dubious sentences , and in which critics of the regime , who have no access to legal support and appropriate legal procedures , are kept in isolation for months , " said lingenstahl . " if there is a place in which democratic principles ought to be respected , as my colleague from the iranian foreign ministry believes he needs to establish , then he should turn to his own country , " he said . a president with a shady past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's newly elected president mahmud ahmadinejad ahmadinejad has been accused of being one of the hardliners who took part in the attack on the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
he is also rumored to have been involved in a murder of an exiled iranian kurd politician and his two associates in vienna .
but the official investigation of the austrian authorities has produced no results , and neither of the two accusations have been proven . the growing tensions between iran and germany are possibly related to the stagnating negotiations about iran 's atomic weapons .

ever since the german defense minister accused the iranian president of having been involved in terrorist activities , the diplomatic exchange between berlin and tehran has taken an unusually acrimonious tone . in an interview for the german weekly der spiegel , published monday , the german interior minister otto schily expressed his concern about " a fundamentalist coming to power in tehran . "
he was referring to mahmoud ahmadinejad , who was elected president of iran on june 24 . " we ca n't be certain that he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- has absolutely distanced himself from terrorism , " schily said . the spokesperson of the iranian ministry of foreign affairs , hamid resa asefi , responded to schily 's criticism of the iranian president by calling it " unfounded and laughable " and advising the german minister " to express himself more carefully , get rid of the influence of zionist circles and respect democratic principles . " berlin strikes back in a rebuttal from the german ministry of the interior , rainer lingenstahl , the ministry spokesperson , referred to his iranian colleague 's statements on wednesday as " unbelievable outrageousness . " " it would be difficult to surpass the effrontery of such a voice from a country in which human rights are constantly abused , in which women are flogged as a consequence of dubious sentences , and in which critics of the regime , who have no access to legal support and appropriate legal procedures , are kept in isolation for months , " said lingenstahl .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .

merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc 20 suspects released after court ruling twenty criminal suspects have been released from german jails this week since the country 's top court ruled that the implementation of a new eu extradition order was unconstitutional , the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- said .
all the suspects in question were wanted in european union countries for serious crimes including murder and drug dealing , the bka said .
their release was ordered after the federal constitutional court upheld the appeal of a suspected al qaeda financier , syrian-german businessman mamoun darkazanli , against his extradition to spain .
the tribunal concurred with darkazanli 's argument that handing him over to spanish authorities - as permitted by the new eu policy - would violate germany 's basic law .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities .
-lrb- july 15 , 2005 -rrb- nazi jibes a recipe for disaster german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities .
-lrb- july 15 , 2005 -rrb- nazi jibes a recipe for disaster german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism back to first page back 2/2 germany finally has an immigration law .
what other legislation is essential for streamlining immigration and making integration of foreigners easier ? the immigration law that we have is n't the best , but it does make things simpler in some aspects .
what 's crucial , however , is for germany to implement an anti-discrimination law according to european regulations - though that may become tougher under a conservative government .
germany also needs to humanize its current policy on refugees , which unfortunately has become an eu standard now . also , very importantly , we need to offer illegal immigrants the chance to legalize themselves - something that 's even possible under berlusconi in italy .
talking about illegal persons in germany is a huge taboo - which just shows how loaded the issue is .
we definitely need to improve on regulations for illegal immigrants as well as for refugees and asylum-seekers . one of the enduring images broadcast around the world during the 60th anniversary of world war ii was of a massive demonstration against a planned neo-nazi march in downtown berlin .
is n't it an encouraging sign that ordinary germans take to the streets to counter neo-nazis and send a signal against hate and racism ? # b # an anti-attitude or just being against something is n't an answer .
counter demonstrations - whether it 's by the far-left or by the middle class in germany - seldom lead to a solution or a new stance of solidarity .
it would be better if people were more considerate of others rather than taking to the streets with candles and slogans .
of course , sometimes you need them to show far-right groups that there are limits .
and i do n't think that there are counter demonstrations to neo-nazis groups everywhere in germany . if one wants to really show solidarity with racial minorities then one has to treat them with respect and interest - something that happens much too rarely in everyday life in germany .

the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of no confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court may have to rule on the legality of new elections the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , had lead to the rise of adolf hitler . constitutional difficulties president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , however , does not believe that the current misuse of the confidence vote mechanism is the best solution for calling early elections . " i believe we should change it , " said thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliamentarians should be able to fire themeselves , according to wolfgang thierse according to thierse , the parliament ought to be able to dissolve itself , without the intervention of the president of the republic .
as an additional security measure , one could require a 2/3 or 3/4 majority for the motion to be passed . " one should n't be changing the constitution in a haphazard sort of way , " thierse said , hoping that the issue would be raised and discussed in the next legislative period . when asked about how he felt about the current situation and the upcoming decision by president köhler , thierse replied he was " not really nervous . " thierse stressed , however , that president köhler was free to make his own decision .
" he can even decide against the country 's mood , " thierse said . eager for early elections the country is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
83 percent germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , but 76 precent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder 's letter asking the parliament for a vote of confidence schröder has been undermined by a series of poor performances for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in state polls and says he needs to know if the electorate still backs a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms he has already begun to introduce . in an impassioned speech before the vote of confidence on july 1 , schröder said he was seeking new elections because the question arose whether " my policies and i are still fully able to function " . no backing ? immediately afterwards , he went to president köhler , asking him to bring the election forward .
seeking guidance in his decision , köhler asked schröder to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier his spokesman bela anda said provided " a documentation of the difficulties of implementing his government program . "
it included dozens of newspaper articles describing the malaise within the government and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics within the ruling coalition of spd and greens . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance known as the left party which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery dw-world looks at the constitutional aspects of the early elections that have led some to cry foul and others to praise the county 's electoral system .
election decision day looms for germany the deadline for president horst köhler to decide whether or not to approve new federal elections is this friday .
should he surprise everyone with a no vote , the chancellor plans to continue to govern .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .

gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara .

backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .

gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .
merkel 's position was echoed by french interior miniters nicolas sarkozy . " after the failures of the referendums -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- in france and the netherlands , we need to start worrying about europe 's future .
we need to talk about the limits of future enlargement .
we need borders .
people have to know where the borders are , " merkel said . merkel is expected to become german chancellor in an early election this fall and sarkozy is widely tipped to become french president in two years ' time . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
-lrb- june 29 , 2005 -rrb- merkel calls for petition against turkish membership germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel has called for a petition to be drawn up against turkey 's membership of the european union and has advocated privileged partnership status as an alternative .

the court in karlsruhe said it had set aside october 20 and possibly october 21 for appeal hearings in the case , in which top-ranking corporate executives , including deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , were acquitted last july .
then , ackermann and five others were cleared of wrongdoing by a court in düsseldorf in the multi-billion-euro takeover of german telecommunications firm mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
in the high-profile corporate trial , the men were found not guilty of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago .
prosecutors , including chief federal prosecutor kay nehm , filed an appeal against the not-guilty verdict .
the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for the six men - who alongside ackermann included former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste .
the managers were charged with breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 69 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . dw-world.de prosecution appeals mannesmann verdict after a german judge acquitted all defendants of charges of breach of trust in the mannesmann trial , prosecutors said friday they would appeal the decision .

the court in karlsruhe said it had set aside october 20 and possibly october 21 for appeal hearings in the case , in which top-ranking corporate executives , including deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , were acquitted last july .
then , ackermann and five others were cleared of wrongdoing by a court in düsseldorf in the multi-billion-euro takeover of german telecommunications firm mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
in the high-profile corporate trial , the men were found not guilty of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago .
prosecutors , including chief federal prosecutor kay nehm , filed an appeal against the not-guilty verdict .
the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for the six men - who alongside ackermann included former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste .
the managers were charged with breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 69 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . dw-world.de prosecution appeals mannesmann verdict after a german judge acquitted all defendants of charges of breach of trust in the mannesmann trial , prosecutors said friday they would appeal the decision .

" i have noticed that people are very enthusiastic that they will get the chance to meet someone from the organization , " beckenbauer said at a press conference in munich . some german newspapers have already baptised his visits as the " kaiser 's world tour " in reference to the 59-year-old 's nickname .
the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .

" i have noticed that people are very enthusiastic that they will get the chance to meet someone from the organization , " beckenbauer said at a press conference in munich . some german newspapers have already baptised his visits as the " kaiser 's world tour " in reference to the 59-year-old 's nickname .
the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .
his completed journey of 120,000 kilometers will be the equivalent of three world tours in 50 days . though beckenbauer 's travels are meant to promote germany 's world cup efforts , they certainly wo n't hurt his campaign to become the next head of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe . beckenbauer and platini favorites current uefa president lennart johansson is set to step down in 2007 .
beckenbauer and france 's michel platini are the favorites to succeed the 75-year-old swede , who has headed uefa since 1990 .
johansson was giving a one-year extension in order to postpone the election to coincide with the vote for the next head of fifa , the organization that governs the sport worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele , franz beckenbauer , and the world cup mascot goleo .
brazil icon pele , fifa president sepp blatter and johansson have already given their backing for beckenbauer to become the next uefa president .
" franz achieves whatever he sets his mind to , " pele said in a newspaper interview in april .
" i think he is the right man for the uefa presidency .
platini wants the job too , but franz has more ambition . " platini , who is 10 years younger than beckenbauer , has come under fire for suggestions that could shake up european soccer .
he has said he would endeavour to help clubs keep their younger players , whom they have invested in from youth level , and change the champions league format . as expected , the kaiser also has the backing of his colleagues at bayern munich , where his is currently the club 's president .
" michel platini has a crazy revolution at the back of his mind , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge said in may .
" beckenbauer values football traditions and will keep the game going in the right direction . " dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no world cup party for berlin ?

ever since the german defense minister accused the iranian president of having been involved in terrorist activities , the diplomatic exchange between berlin and tehran has taken an unusually acrimonious tone . in an interview for the german weekly der spiegel , published monday , the german interior minister otto schily expressed his concern about " a fundamentalist coming to power in tehran . "
he was referring to mahmoud ahmadinejad , who was elected president of iran on june 24 . " we ca n't be certain that he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- has absolutely distanced himself from terrorism , " schily said . the spokesperson of the iranian ministry of foreign affairs , hamid resa asefi , responded to schily 's criticism of the iranian president by calling it " unfounded and laughable " and advising the german minister " to express himself more carefully , get rid of the influence of zionist circles and respect democratic principles .

but the official investigation of the austrian authorities has produced no results , and neither of the two accusations have been proven . the growing tensions between iran and germany are possibly related to the stagnating negotiations about iran 's atomic weapons .

all the suspects in question were wanted in european union countries for serious crimes including murder and drug dealing , the bka said .
their release was ordered after the federal constitutional court upheld the appeal of a suspected al qaeda financier , syrian-german businessman mamoun darkazanli , against his extradition to spain .
the tribunal concurred with darkazanli 's argument that handing him over to spanish authorities - as permitted by the new eu policy - would violate germany 's basic law .
european officials said the court 's refusal to extradite darkazanli was a blow to europe 's efforts to combat terrorism .
but the german court said the eu warrant - or specifically , the german law implementing it - does not adequately protect its nationals from capricious prosecution in other countries .
the bka said that darkazanli , who was freed from a jail in the nothern port city of hamburg hours after the ruling monday , was the only terror suspect released under the ruling this week . dw-world.de al qaeda suspect walks free in germany a suspected al qaeda financier was freed from jail in germany on monday after the country 's highest court blocked his extradition to spain , dealing a new blow to german anti-terror efforts .

what other legislation is essential for streamlining immigration and making integration of foreigners easier ? the immigration law that we have is n't the best , but it does make things simpler in some aspects .
what 's crucial , however , is for germany to implement an anti-discrimination law according to european regulations - though that may become tougher under a conservative government .
germany also needs to humanize its current policy on refugees , which unfortunately has become an eu standard now . also , very importantly , we need to offer illegal immigrants the chance to legalize themselves - something that 's even possible under berlusconi in italy .
talking about illegal persons in germany is a huge taboo - which just shows how loaded the issue is .
we definitely need to improve on regulations for illegal immigrants as well as for refugees and asylum-seekers . one of the enduring images broadcast around the world during the 60th anniversary of world war ii was of a massive demonstration against a planned neo-nazi march in downtown berlin .
is n't it an encouraging sign that ordinary germans take to the streets to counter neo-nazis and send a signal against hate and racism ? # b # an anti-attitude or just being against something is n't an answer .
counter demonstrations - whether it 's by the far-left or by the middle class in germany - seldom lead to a solution or a new stance of solidarity .
it would be better if people were more considerate of others rather than taking to the streets with candles and slogans .
of course , sometimes you need them to show far-right groups that there are limits .
and i do n't think that there are counter demonstrations to neo-nazis groups everywhere in germany . if one wants to really show solidarity with racial minorities then one has to treat them with respect and interest - something that happens much too rarely in everyday life in germany .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .
merkel 's position was echoed by french interior miniters nicolas sarkozy . " after the failures of the referendums -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- in france and the netherlands , we need to start worrying about europe 's future .
we need to talk about the limits of future enlargement .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .
merkel 's position was echoed by french interior miniters nicolas sarkozy . " after the failures of the referendums -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- in france and the netherlands , we need to start worrying about europe 's future .
we need to talk about the limits of future enlargement .
we need borders .
people have to know where the borders are , " merkel said . merkel is expected to become german chancellor in an early election this fall and sarkozy is widely tipped to become french president in two years ' time . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

new elections must take place within 60 days of the dissolution of the parliament . yet , despite the clear vote of no confidence , which the ruling coalition received in the parliament , köhler is entitled to make his own decision whether to dissolve the parliament or not . not a done deal " it is outrageous how all the parties are behaving as if the election were already a done deal , " said wolf-rüdiger schenke , lawyer representing the green party legislator werner schulz . if köhler gives a go-ahead to the new elections , several members of the parliament , including schulz , intend to take the issue to the federal constitutional court .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .

merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved .

merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .

she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .

but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .

it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

" president horst köhler will address citizens in a televised speech from this evening at 8.15 pm -lrb- 1815 gmt -rrb- to announce and explain his decision on the chancellor 's proposal based on article 68 of the constitution , " köhler 's office said in a statement . köhler 's decision will come one day before his constitutionally mandated deadline , exactly three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary vote of confidence with the aim of prompting elections one year ahead of schedule . the german press and the majority of analysts are predicting that köhler will give the go-ahead for elections , probably to take place on september 18 .
new elections must take place within 60 days of the dissolution of the parliament . yet , despite the clear vote of no confidence , which the ruling coalition received in the parliament , köhler is entitled to make his own decision whether to dissolve the parliament or not . not a done deal " it is outrageous how all the parties are behaving as if the election were already a done deal , " said wolf-rüdiger schenke , lawyer representing the green party legislator werner schulz . if köhler gives a go-ahead to the new elections , several members of the parliament , including schulz , intend to take the issue to the federal constitutional court .
the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of no confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court may have to rule on the legality of new elections the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , had lead to the rise of adolf hitler . constitutional difficulties president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , however , does not believe that the current misuse of the confidence vote mechanism is the best solution for calling early elections . " i believe we should change it , " said thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliamentarians should be able to fire themeselves , according to wolfgang thierse according to thierse , the parliament ought to be able to dissolve itself , without the intervention of the president of the republic .
as an additional security measure , one could require a 2/3 or 3/4 majority for the motion to be passed . " one should n't be changing the constitution in a haphazard sort of way , " thierse said , hoping that the issue would be raised and discussed in the next legislative period . when asked about how he felt about the current situation and the upcoming decision by president köhler , thierse replied he was " not really nervous . " thierse stressed , however , that president köhler was free to make his own decision .
" he can even decide against the country 's mood , " thierse said . eager for early elections the country is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
83 percent germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , but 76 precent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder 's letter asking the parliament for a vote of confidence schröder has been undermined by a series of poor performances for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in state polls and says he needs to know if the electorate still backs a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms he has already begun to introduce . in an impassioned speech before the vote of confidence on july 1 , schröder said he was seeking new elections because the question arose whether " my policies and i are still fully able to function " . no backing ? immediately afterwards , he went to president köhler , asking him to bring the election forward .
seeking guidance in his decision , köhler asked schröder to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier his spokesman bela anda said provided " a documentation of the difficulties of implementing his government program . "
it included dozens of newspaper articles describing the malaise within the government and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics within the ruling coalition of spd and greens . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance known as the left party which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery dw-world looks at the constitutional aspects of the early elections that have led some to cry foul and others to praise the county 's electoral system .

should he surprise everyone with a no vote , the chancellor plans to continue to govern .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .

but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .

there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .

it 's already happening .

the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to .

ever since the german defense minister accused the iranian president of having been involved in terrorist activities , the diplomatic exchange between berlin and tehran has taken an unusually acrimonious tone . in an interview for the german weekly der spiegel , published monday , the german interior minister otto schily expressed his concern about " a fundamentalist coming to power in tehran . "
he was referring to mahmoud ahmadinejad , who was elected president of iran on june 24 . " we ca n't be certain that he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- has absolutely distanced himself from terrorism , " schily said . the spokesperson of the iranian ministry of foreign affairs , hamid resa asefi , responded to schily 's criticism of the iranian president by calling it " unfounded and laughable " and advising the german minister " to express himself more carefully , get rid of the influence of zionist circles and respect democratic principles . " berlin strikes back in a rebuttal from the german ministry of the interior , rainer lingenstahl , the ministry spokesperson , referred to his iranian colleague 's statements on wednesday as " unbelievable outrageousness . " " it would be difficult to surpass the effrontery of such a voice from a country in which human rights are constantly abused , in which women are flogged as a consequence of dubious sentences , and in which critics of the regime , who have no access to legal support and appropriate legal procedures , are kept in isolation for months , " said lingenstahl . " if there is a place in which democratic principles ought to be respected , as my colleague from the iranian foreign ministry believes he needs to establish , then he should turn to his own country , " he said . a president with a shady past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's newly elected president mahmud ahmadinejad ahmadinejad has been accused of being one of the hardliners who took part in the attack on the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
he is also rumored to have been involved in a murder of an exiled iranian kurd politician and his two associates in vienna .
but the official investigation of the austrian authorities has produced no results , and neither of the two accusations have been proven . the growing tensions between iran and germany are possibly related to the stagnating negotiations about iran 's atomic weapons .
although great britain , france and germany insist that iran gives up its plans for accumulating uranium , iran has repeatedly turned down that request . the iranian spokesperson said his government would require an explanation from the german government for schily 's statements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parties not sanguine about eu-iran talks the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program .
-lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran election spells trouble for nuclear talks iran 's dramatic shift to the right with the electoral victory of ultra-conservative tehran mayor mahmoud ahmadinejad spells trouble for already tense nuclear negotiations with the eu and us governments .

ever since the german defense minister accused the iranian president of having been involved in terrorist activities , the diplomatic exchange between berlin and tehran has taken an unusually acrimonious tone . in an interview for the german weekly der spiegel , published monday , the german interior minister otto schily expressed his concern about " a fundamentalist coming to power in tehran . "
he was referring to mahmoud ahmadinejad , who was elected president of iran on june 24 . " we ca n't be certain that he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- has absolutely distanced himself from terrorism , " schily said . the spokesperson of the iranian ministry of foreign affairs , hamid resa asefi , responded to schily 's criticism of the iranian president by calling it " unfounded and laughable " and advising the german minister " to express himself more carefully , get rid of the influence of zionist circles and respect democratic principles .

" i have noticed that people are very enthusiastic that they will get the chance to meet someone from the organization , " beckenbauer said at a press conference in munich . some german newspapers have already baptised his visits as the " kaiser 's world tour " in reference to the 59-year-old 's nickname .
the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .
his completed journey of 120,000 kilometers will be the equivalent of three world tours in 50 days . though beckenbauer 's travels are meant to promote germany 's world cup efforts , they certainly wo n't hurt his campaign to become the next head of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe . beckenbauer and platini favorites current uefa president lennart johansson is set to step down in 2007 .
beckenbauer and france 's michel platini are the favorites to succeed the 75-year-old swede , who has headed uefa since 1990 .
johansson was giving a one-year extension in order to postpone the election to coincide with the vote for the next head of fifa , the organization that governs the sport worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele , franz beckenbauer , and the world cup mascot goleo .
brazil icon pele , fifa president sepp blatter and johansson have already given their backing for beckenbauer to become the next uefa president .
" franz achieves whatever he sets his mind to , " pele said in a newspaper interview in april .
" i think he is the right man for the uefa presidency .
platini wants the job too , but franz has more ambition . " platini , who is 10 years younger than beckenbauer , has come under fire for suggestions that could shake up european soccer .

" i have noticed that people are very enthusiastic that they will get the chance to meet someone from the organization , " beckenbauer said at a press conference in munich . some german newspapers have already baptised his visits as the " kaiser 's world tour " in reference to the 59-year-old 's nickname .
the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .
his completed journey of 120,000 kilometers will be the equivalent of three world tours in 50 days . though beckenbauer 's travels are meant to promote germany 's world cup efforts , they certainly wo n't hurt his campaign to become the next head of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe . beckenbauer and platini favorites current uefa president lennart johansson is set to step down in 2007 .
beckenbauer and france 's michel platini are the favorites to succeed the 75-year-old swede , who has headed uefa since 1990 .
johansson was giving a one-year extension in order to postpone the election to coincide with the vote for the next head of fifa , the organization that governs the sport worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele , franz beckenbauer , and the world cup mascot goleo .
brazil icon pele , fifa president sepp blatter and johansson have already given their backing for beckenbauer to become the next uefa president .
" franz achieves whatever he sets his mind to , " pele said in a newspaper interview in april .
" i think he is the right man for the uefa presidency .
platini wants the job too , but franz has more ambition . " platini , who is 10 years younger than beckenbauer , has come under fire for suggestions that could shake up european soccer .
he has said he would endeavour to help clubs keep their younger players , whom they have invested in from youth level , and change the champions league format . as expected , the kaiser also has the backing of his colleagues at bayern munich , where his is currently the club 's president .

nothing unusual there .
but in this case , the woman was clad in an unbuttoned jeans jacket and nothing else .
and although germans are famously tolerant of nudity , officials said they could have arrested her for disturbing the peace .
but they did not . " we are a tolerant city , " police spokesman berkard jahn told reuters .
" we decided to let her go home with a verbal warning to dress appropriately next time . "
he said that decision was made because few people and presumably no small children saw her at that time of the day .

nothing unusual there .
but in this case , the woman was clad in an unbuttoned jeans jacket and nothing else .
and although germans are famously tolerant of nudity , officials said they could have arrested her for disturbing the peace .
but they did not . " we are a tolerant city , " police spokesman berkard jahn told reuters .
" we decided to let her go home with a verbal warning to dress appropriately next time . "
he said that decision was made because few people and presumably no small children saw her at that time of the day .

the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .

he has said he would endeavour to help clubs keep their younger players , whom they have invested in from youth level , and change the champions league format . as expected , the kaiser also has the backing of his colleagues at bayern munich , where his is currently the club 's president .

" i have noticed that people are very enthusiastic that they will get the chance to meet someone from the organization , " beckenbauer said at a press conference in munich . some german newspapers have already baptised his visits as the " kaiser 's world tour " in reference to the 59-year-old 's nickname .
the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .
his completed journey of 120,000 kilometers will be the equivalent of three world tours in 50 days . though beckenbauer 's travels are meant to promote germany 's world cup efforts , they certainly wo n't hurt his campaign to become the next head of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe . beckenbauer and platini favorites current uefa president lennart johansson is set to step down in 2007 .
beckenbauer and france 's michel platini are the favorites to succeed the 75-year-old swede , who has headed uefa since 1990 .
johansson was giving a one-year extension in order to postpone the election to coincide with the vote for the next head of fifa , the organization that governs the sport worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele , franz beckenbauer , and the world cup mascot goleo .
brazil icon pele , fifa president sepp blatter and johansson have already given their backing for beckenbauer to become the next uefa president .
" franz achieves whatever he sets his mind to , " pele said in a newspaper interview in april .
" i think he is the right man for the uefa presidency .
platini wants the job too , but franz has more ambition . " platini , who is 10 years younger than beckenbauer , has come under fire for suggestions that could shake up european soccer .
he has said he would endeavour to help clubs keep their younger players , whom they have invested in from youth level , and change the champions league format . as expected , the kaiser also has the backing of his colleagues at bayern munich , where his is currently the club 's president .
" michel platini has a crazy revolution at the back of his mind , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge said in may .
" beckenbauer values football traditions and will keep the game going in the right direction . " dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no world cup party for berlin ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election issues : what 's at stake a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism back to first page back 2/2 germany finally has an immigration law .
what other legislation is essential for streamlining immigration and making integration of foreigners easier ? the immigration law that we have is n't the best , but it does make things simpler in some aspects .
what 's crucial , however , is for germany to implement an anti-discrimination law according to european regulations - though that may become tougher under a conservative government .
germany also needs to humanize its current policy on refugees , which unfortunately has become an eu standard now . also , very importantly , we need to offer illegal immigrants the chance to legalize themselves - something that 's even possible under berlusconi in italy .
talking about illegal persons in germany is a huge taboo - which just shows how loaded the issue is .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .
there 's absolutely no understanding in germany of the concept of integration and coexistence of different cultures .
though the germans say they 're rational and have laws for everything , when it comes to socio-political things like respect , tolerance , etc , there the germans think having rules is wrong . the reasons for a negative attitude towards foreigners are different in eastern germany .
there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .

there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to .

there , foreigners still hardly make up even one percent of the population in certain regions and cities , as opposed to western states such as north-rhine westphalia or even bavaria .
the history of racism in eastern germany , however , has its roots in the former communist dictatorship .
there is simply no tradition of democratic culture and tolerance in the east , and unfortunately there was a very hesitant attempt to build one after the fall of the berlin wall . the annual report by germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution shows that crimes and violent acts by right-wing extremists , particularly in eastern germany , are on the rise .
just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election issues : what 's at stake a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel unemployment germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 germany 's long road to multiculturalism 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism is a nagging problem in eastern germany with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism . anetta kahane , 51 , is one of germany 's best-known anti-racism campaigners .
she is the chairwoman of the amadeu antonio foundation , which was named after an angolan beaten to death by skinheads near berlin only after a month after reunification in 1990 .
raised in eastern germany , kahane 's work on fighting racism in the east has focused largely on promoting democratic values in youth clubs and workshops .
she was named a few years ago as one of time magazine 's " people to watch " as part of its europe special issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anetta kahane kahane -lrb- photo -rrb- spoke to dw-world about a recent increase in xenophobia in germany , the nagging problem of right-wing extremism in the country 's former communist east and the danger it poses to democracy and how politicians need to take serious note of a more racially-mixed germany as federal elections loom . dw-world : according to a new study conducted by the university of leipzig , every fourth german subscribes to xenophobic views .
does that surprise you ? anetta kahane : not in the least .
the results correspond to the perceptions and attitudes that we -lrb- anti-racism campaigners -rrb- come across in our daily work in germany .
in fact , i think the study is relatively modest since it only describes what can be really verified .
but , if you 're talking about latent racism or xenophobic ideologies , then those figures would actually be much higher . how do you explain the increasingly negative attitude towards foreigners in germany at a time when statistics show that the number of foreigners in the country has actually decreased - from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 ? firstly , racism does n't need any concrete occasions .
it 's an ideology that discriminates against groups of people , and for that you do n't really need those concrete groups .
you can see that very well in the case of anti-semitism - there are hardly any jews in germany but there are a lot of anti-semites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kreuzberg neighborhood of berlin in the case of germany , particularly in western germany , policies towards foreigners were always based on the assumption that they would one day go back to where they came from - it was more an attitude of " we have to integrate them , rather than we want to . "
it was all regarded as a ' problem ' and germany 's permanent denial mode of " we are n't a country of immigrants " has led to the fact that the image of germans is largely determined by stereotypes and physical characteristics . efforts have been made to break that pattern of thinking by reforming citizenship laws .
-lrb- editor 's note : the laws are now based on place of birth rather than descent . -rrb-
but , in principle , the view that someone who does n't correspond to a stereotypical image of the germans - a turkish man , for instance , with a german passport - still largely dominates in society and stands in sharp contrast to countries such as britain or france .
the policies of the past decades , however , were programmed to backfire - after all you ca n't follow them for so many years and play with prejudices and then expect people to suddenly give up racist attitudes . also , germany has no concept of political correctness , unlike the anglo-saxon world .

just how serious is the situation ? the explosive situation in eastern germany in the early 90s after the fall of the berlin wall did establish a kind of social movement against foreigners , one that 's become deeply entrenched over time .
though the situation today in eastern germany is n't so palpable , what we 're seeing today is definitely a result of the actions of right-wing extremists in the early 90s .
the fact remains that right-wing extremists are becoming stronger in eastern germany today and foreigners are n't interested in moving there for fear of being hounded or even attacked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration by the far-right party , npd politicians refuse to see or understand just how dramatic the situation is and how it 's endangering democracy .
most politicians - whether they 're in the federal parliament or in local governments - do n't perceive right-wing extremism in eastern germany as a challenge , but rather as something complex . unfortunately , the topic has been reduced to something of a political ping-pong game between the various parties and there 's a tendency to play it down . the core problem is that politicians in germany find it hard to perceive right-wing extremism as a real danger because german culture does n't at all have a socio-political basis . in all likelihood , federal elections will take place in september .
most parties are already in the thick of election campaigns .
will immigration be a key issue ? uncomfortable topics such as democratic values and the fight against right-wing extremism are n't popular election issues .
instead , politicians tend to go for populism and that 's always dangerous .
it 's already happening .
oskar lafontaine , with his new " left party , " has set the ball rolling with his nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign employees -rrb- in a speech on unemployment .
the danger of populist attitudes is present throughout the political spectrum - among left-wingers as well as the far-right .
and it 's clear that lafontaine 's new party , which enjoys support of some 30 percent in eastern germany , also attracts right-wingers .
the problem is thus that boundaries are blurring between the agendas of the left and the right . so far , however , none of the party platforms unveiled have contained anything constructive as far as policies towards immigrants goes .
i understand that those ca n't work as election topics , but i would expect at least a few points to be addressed on important issues . instead , if the conservatives do come to power - which is widely believed to be the case - there 's a huge fear that several programs and initiatives against right-wing extremism financed by the federal government will simply be scrapped .
the christian democratic union has already indicated it plans to stop those programs .
again it 's a political game .
but , if the next government does really do that , it will be an awful blow for german democracy . continue reading to find out why kahane thinks taking part in a counter demonstration against neo-nazis is n't enough 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

ever since the german defense minister accused the iranian president of having been involved in terrorist activities , the diplomatic exchange between berlin and tehran has taken an unusually acrimonious tone . in an interview for the german weekly der spiegel , published monday , the german interior minister otto schily expressed his concern about " a fundamentalist coming to power in tehran .

he was referring to mahmoud ahmadinejad , who was elected president of iran on june 24 . " we ca n't be certain that he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- has absolutely distanced himself from terrorism , " schily said . the spokesperson of the iranian ministry of foreign affairs , hamid resa asefi , responded to schily 's criticism of the iranian president by calling it " unfounded and laughable " and advising the german minister " to express himself more carefully , get rid of the influence of zionist circles and respect democratic principles .

" i have noticed that people are very enthusiastic that they will get the chance to meet someone from the organization , " beckenbauer said at a press conference in munich . some german newspapers have already baptised his visits as the " kaiser 's world tour " in reference to the 59-year-old 's nickname .
the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .

" i think he is the right man for the uefa presidency .
platini wants the job too , but franz has more ambition . " platini , who is 10 years younger than beckenbauer , has come under fire for suggestions that could shake up european soccer .
he has said he would endeavour to help clubs keep their younger players , whom they have invested in from youth level , and change the champions league format . as expected , the kaiser also has the backing of his colleagues at bayern munich , where his is currently the club 's president .
" michel platini has a crazy revolution at the back of his mind , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge said in may .

" president horst köhler will address citizens in a televised speech from this evening at 8.15 pm -lrb- 1815 gmt -rrb- to announce and explain his decision on the chancellor 's proposal based on article 68 of the constitution , " köhler 's office said in a statement . köhler 's decision will come one day before his constitutionally mandated deadline , exactly three weeks after schröder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary vote of confidence with the aim of prompting elections one year ahead of schedule . the german press and the majority of analysts are predicting that köhler will give the go-ahead for elections , probably to take place on september 18 .
new elections must take place within 60 days of the dissolution of the parliament . yet , despite the clear vote of no confidence , which the ruling coalition received in the parliament , köhler is entitled to make his own decision whether to dissolve the parliament or not . not a done deal " it is outrageous how all the parties are behaving as if the election were already a done deal , " said wolf-rüdiger schenke , lawyer representing the green party legislator werner schulz . if köhler gives a go-ahead to the new elections , several members of the parliament , including schulz , intend to take the issue to the federal constitutional court .
the opponents of the new elections argue that chancellor schröder 's vote of no confidence was " faked " because the chancellor still had a majority in the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitutional court may have to rule on the legality of new elections the german constitution , which was adopted in 1949 , makes it deliberately difficult for early elections to be called , and only under extraordinary circumstances . one of the main goals of the 1949 constitution was to create conditions for political stability in the post-war period and prevent governments from rotating , the way they did in the 1920s and early 30s .
it is widely believed that the political instability of the period of the weimer republic , when german had no less than 12 chancellors , had lead to the rise of adolf hitler . constitutional difficulties president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , however , does not believe that the current misuse of the confidence vote mechanism is the best solution for calling early elections . " i believe we should change it , " said thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliamentarians should be able to fire themeselves , according to wolfgang thierse according to thierse , the parliament ought to be able to dissolve itself , without the intervention of the president of the republic .
as an additional security measure , one could require a 2/3 or 3/4 majority for the motion to be passed . " one should n't be changing the constitution in a haphazard sort of way , " thierse said , hoping that the issue would be raised and discussed in the next legislative period . when asked about how he felt about the current situation and the upcoming decision by president köhler , thierse replied he was " not really nervous . " thierse stressed , however , that president köhler was free to make his own decision .
" he can even decide against the country 's mood , " thierse said . eager for early elections the country is very much in favor of new elections .
according to a recent poll , 73 percent of the population believes the elections are necessary .
83 percent germans believe the new elections will bring a change of government , but 76 precent also believe that the new conservative government would not do a better job than the ruling coalition of social democrats and the green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder 's letter asking the parliament for a vote of confidence schröder has been undermined by a series of poor performances for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in state polls and says he needs to know if the electorate still backs a set of sometimes painful social welfare reforms he has already begun to introduce . in an impassioned speech before the vote of confidence on july 1 , schröder said he was seeking new elections because the question arose whether " my policies and i are still fully able to function " . no backing ? immediately afterwards , he went to president köhler , asking him to bring the election forward .
seeking guidance in his decision , köhler asked schröder to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the backing of his coalition . the chancellor replied with a 200-page dossier his spokesman bela anda said provided " a documentation of the difficulties of implementing his government program . "
it included dozens of newspaper articles describing the malaise within the government and interviews with some of his most outspoken critics within the ruling coalition of spd and greens . if elections go ahead , schröder faces another headache with the creation of a new left-wing alliance known as the left party which risks drawing working-class support away from the social democrats . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery dw-world looks at the constitutional aspects of the early elections that have led some to cry foul and others to praise the county 's electoral system .

but there is little doubt that turkey 's drive to become part of the 25-nation eu is currently mired in problems . kurdish separatists are believed to be behind a bomb attack that killed five people - including british and irish tourists - on saturday in a western turkish seaside resort .
combined with the exchange of threats between turkish officials and kurdish rebels across the border in iraq , the increased tensions could help increase european doubts whether the country is cut out for eu membership . heinz kramer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told dw-radio that any turkish military operation against kurdish rebels in iraq would put ankara 's eu ambitions on ice . " the europeans would step on the breaks and the accession process would be suspended for the time being , " kramer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül irish foreign minister dermot ahern told his turkish counterpart abdullah gül in ankara this week there was a growing fear of muslim countries among europeans , which posed a risk to turkey 's ambition of joining the european union , according to ahern 's spokesman .
gül assured ahern that immediate steps would be taken to ensure the security of western tourists in turkey after saturday 's deadly attack , but the damage may already be done . a new opinion poll showed a majority of europeans are opposed to offering turkey eu membership .
a eurobarometer poll released this week indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor . british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country took over the eu reins this month , shrugged off those numbers on monday , saying european leaders would stick to there plans to begin talks with ankara . " there 's been a strategic decision made by the european union that turkey 's future lies in europe , and that our strategic interests lie in that happening , " said straw , chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . no guarantees but straw , whose country has been a champion of ankara 's hopes , stressed that the eu has made it clear to turkey that there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .
in any case , however the negotiations proceed , " it 's widely agreed this -lrb- eu entry -rrb- would not happen for at least a decade , " he told reporters after the monthly ministerial talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw gestures while speaking during a media conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers at the eu council building in brussels , monday july 18 , 2005 .
he also underlined that eu governments will ultimately have the last say on turkey 's hopes , as ankara 's entry will have to be ratified by all member states , either by parliamentary vote or public referendum .
" that 's the appropriate way to discern popular opinion , so it 's not being bypassed at all , " he said . eu leaders agreed last december to open talks with ankara , but set a number of conditions , and notably stressed that the negotiations would be " open-ended " - meaning they may not lead to eu membership .
backers of turkey 's hopes say notably that ankara must be firmly tied into the eu to extend stability into the volatile region on europe 's southeastern rim . critics say the country is simply too big , and too economically and culturally different , to integrate into the expanding bloc , with many calling for a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full entry . austrian opposition austria has been one of the most vocal opponents of turkish eu membership , and a senior minister in vienna said this week that discussions on ankara 's hopes should be postponed .
" turkey does not meet any of the criteria necessary to enter into the eu - neither economic , social , nor political , " finance minister karl-heinz grasser told the daily standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel grasser remains in the minority of european leaders , however , that could soon change .
the head of germany 's conservative opposition , angela merkel , on tuesday reiterated her belief in a " privileged partnership " for ankara rather than full accession , telling journalists in paris that a victory of her party would lead to " intense discussions " in the eu ahead of the october target date for the start of membership talks .
merkel 's position was echoed by french interior miniters nicolas sarkozy . " after the failures of the referendums -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- in france and the netherlands , we need to start worrying about europe 's future .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .

even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again .

merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .

although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again .

merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.07.2005 schröder to play the iraq card again ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old habits die hard : will schröder make iraq a campaign issue again ?
although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 . the iraq war was one of the most important , if not the defining , campaign issue during the 2002 german elections .
gerhard schröder won re-election largely because he reflected the german public opinion at the time by loudly opposing the build-up to war in iraq and criticizing the united states for planning an invasion . the 2005 election is bound to be quite different .
even though iraq remained a hot-button issue in the british , spanish and us elections over the past year and a half , these days germans are mostly preoccupied with domestic issues , most notably the unemployment rate , which has reached post-war highs under schröder 's government . a slight chance the continuing violence in iraq and recent terrorist attacks in london , however , may be presenting a window of opportunity for schröder to wave his pacifist flag again . " you ca n't expect the chancellor to ignore the issue that got him elected last time around , " a senior advisor to schröder said last week . the social democrats have stressed in their election program that if it had been up to the opposition christian democrats , german troops would be in iraq today . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud of his achievements : joschka fischer joschka fischer , german foreign minister , made a similar connection during an impassioned july 1 speech in the parliament , when he cited germany 's refusal to participate in the iraq war as one of the " reasons to be proud of what we have achieved . " overwhelming domestic issues the importance of the domestic agenda , however , has increased the chances of angela merkel becoming germany 's first woman chancellor .
the latest opinion poll gave her conservative christian union bloc a clear lead of 17 percentage points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has every reason to be optimistic about the upcoming elections merkel is promising to slash germany 's unemployment rate and inject new life into the euro zone 's biggest , but stagnating , economy .
merkel has unveiled plans to create jobs and raise the value-added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union , to 18 percent from 16 percent today . on the question of iraq , merkel has attempted to balance her support for the us intervention with an unwillingness to send german troops to iraq .
recently , however , she has been increasingly vociferous about criticizing the social democrats for hurting us - german relations . desperation ? " i do get the impression that schröder and the spd are trying to make the old iraq debate an election issue again , " said wolfgang schäuble , a foreign policy expert for the cdu . " that is above all a sign they are desperate and lack good , forward-looking arguments for why people should vote for them , " he said . according to manfred güllner , director of the forsa polling institute , it would be , indeed , very difficult for schröder to play the iraq card again . " he will try to present his iraq policy as one of his accomplishments , but i do n't believe it will be a big plus this time , " güllner told reuters . " the war has already happened .
it simply is n't the divisive issue it once was .

" we know that we had four explosions or attempted explosions simultaneously , " london police chief ian blair told reporters .
" at the moment the casualties appear to be very low in the explosions .
the bombs appear to be smaller than on the last occasion .
we do n't know the implications for this yet - clearly this is a very serious incident . " dozens of police and fire engines scrambled to the scenes , evacuating three subway stations and cordoning off a wide area in eastern london around a double-decker bus in which the upper-floor windows were blown out . police said they had sent armed officers to investigate an " incident " at university college hospital in central london .
a spokesman was unable to confirm reports on sky news about a man with a device with protruding wires attached to him seen in the area of the hospital .
police said the incident had been contained without providing further details . a city already traumatized stations at oval in southern london , warren street to the north and shepherd 's bush to the west were evacuated .
police said initial investigations of warren street and oval stations found no sign of chemical agents . four subway lines were temporarily shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copycat or same group ?
the blasts hit a city traumatized by the july 7 attacks , in which 56 people were killed including four suspected al-qaeda suicide bombers who blew up three subway trains and a double-decker bus . chaos , panic , witnesses say back on the streets , passengers who had fled the trains reported panic and chaos below ground . victoria line passenger ivan mccracken said he heard a traveler 's backpack had exploded on the subway outside warren street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosions two weeks ago were much more powerful , police officials said " i was in a middle carriage and the train was not far short of warren street station when suddenly the door between my carriage and the next one burst open and dozens of people started rushing through , some were falling and there was mass panic , " he told sky news . " it was difficult to get the story from any of them what had happened but when i got to ground level there was an italian young man comforting an italian girl who told me he had seen what had happened .
he said that a man was carrying a rucksack and the rucksack suddenly exploded .
it was a minor explosion but enough to blow open the rucksack .
the man then made an exclamation as if something had gone wrong .
at that point everyone rushed from the carriage . " " i could just smell smoke " another witness , abena adofo , 23 , told afp that people were running into her carriage .
" i could just smell smoke and i saw lots of people panicking , " she said .
" i was just trying to be calm and get out .
the smell of smoke was coming from the end of the carriage . " stagecoach , which owns the number 26 bus involved in the incident , said the driver heard a bang at around 12:30 p.m.
london time . the bus had left waterloo and was in the shoreditch neighborhood when the incident happened . " the driver heard a bang which appeared to come from the upper deck , " a spokesman told afp .
" when he went upstairs to investigate , the windows on the upper deck were blown out .
the bus is structurally intact and we do n't have any reports of injuries . " british prime minister tony blair urged the public to stay calm . " we know why these things are done - they are done to scare people , " he told reporters .
" fortunately , in this instance , there appear to have been no casualties ...
we 've got to react calmly .
to react in any other way is to engage in the game they want us to engage in .

ever since the german defense minister accused the iranian president of having been involved in terrorist activities , the diplomatic exchange between berlin and tehran has taken an unusually acrimonious tone . in an interview for the german weekly der spiegel , published monday , the german interior minister otto schily expressed his concern about " a fundamentalist coming to power in tehran . "
he was referring to mahmoud ahmadinejad , who was elected president of iran on june 24 . " we ca n't be certain that he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- has absolutely distanced himself from terrorism , " schily said . the spokesperson of the iranian ministry of foreign affairs , hamid resa asefi , responded to schily 's criticism of the iranian president by calling it " unfounded and laughable " and advising the german minister " to express himself more carefully , get rid of the influence of zionist circles and respect democratic principles . " berlin strikes back in a rebuttal from the german ministry of the interior , rainer lingenstahl , the ministry spokesperson , referred to his iranian colleague 's statements on wednesday as " unbelievable outrageousness . " " it would be difficult to surpass the effrontery of such a voice from a country in which human rights are constantly abused , in which women are flogged as a consequence of dubious sentences , and in which critics of the regime , who have no access to legal support and appropriate legal procedures , are kept in isolation for months , " said lingenstahl .

" i have noticed that people are very enthusiastic that they will get the chance to meet someone from the organization , " beckenbauer said at a press conference in munich . some german newspapers have already baptised his visits as the " kaiser 's world tour " in reference to the 59-year-old 's nickname .
the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .
his completed journey of 120,000 kilometers will be the equivalent of three world tours in 50 days . though beckenbauer 's travels are meant to promote germany 's world cup efforts , they certainly wo n't hurt his campaign to become the next head of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe . beckenbauer and platini favorites current uefa president lennart johansson is set to step down in 2007 .
beckenbauer and france 's michel platini are the favorites to succeed the 75-year-old swede , who has headed uefa since 1990 .

brazil icon pele , fifa president sepp blatter and johansson have already given their backing for beckenbauer to become the next uefa president .
" franz achieves whatever he sets his mind to , " pele said in a newspaper interview in april .
" i think he is the right man for the uefa presidency .
platini wants the job too , but franz has more ambition . " platini , who is 10 years younger than beckenbauer , has come under fire for suggestions that could shake up european soccer .
he has said he would endeavour to help clubs keep their younger players , whom they have invested in from youth level , and change the champions league format . as expected , the kaiser also has the backing of his colleagues at bayern munich , where his is currently the club 's president .
" michel platini has a crazy revolution at the back of his mind , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge said in may .

the tour is expected to start in iran on october 2 . the world-spanning trip will see beckenbauer - who won the world cup both as a player and a coach in 1974 and 1990 respectively - visit saudi arabia , south korea and japan as the nations which have already qualified . he will then return to europe between october 24-31 to promote the finals for those nations that have qualified from the european zone before travelling across the atlantic to the americas .
his completed journey of 120,000 kilometers will be the equivalent of three world tours in 50 days . though beckenbauer 's travels are meant to promote germany 's world cup efforts , they certainly wo n't hurt his campaign to become the next head of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe . beckenbauer and platini favorites current uefa president lennart johansson is set to step down in 2007 .
beckenbauer and france 's michel platini are the favorites to succeed the 75-year-old swede , who has headed uefa since 1990 .
johansson was giving a one-year extension in order to postpone the election to coincide with the vote for the next head of fifa , the organization that governs the sport worldwide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele , franz beckenbauer , and the world cup mascot goleo .
brazil icon pele , fifa president sepp blatter and johansson have already given their backing for beckenbauer to become the next uefa president .
" franz achieves whatever he sets his mind to , " pele said in a newspaper interview in april .
" i think he is the right man for the uefa presidency .
platini wants the job too , but franz has more ambition . " platini , who is 10 years younger than beckenbauer , has come under fire for suggestions that could shake up european soccer .
he has said he would endeavour to help clubs keep their younger players , whom they have invested in from youth level , and change the champions league format . as expected , the kaiser also has the backing of his colleagues at bayern munich , where his is currently the club 's president .
" michel platini has a crazy revolution at the back of his mind , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge said in may .
" beckenbauer values football traditions and will keep the game going in the right direction . " dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no world cup party for berlin ?

" we know that we had four explosions or attempted explosions simultaneously , " london police chief ian blair told reporters .
" at the moment the casualties appear to be very low in the explosions .
the bombs appear to be smaller than on the last occasion .
we do n't know the implications for this yet - clearly this is a very serious incident . " dozens of police and fire engines scrambled to the scenes , evacuating three subway stations and cordoning off a wide area in eastern london around a double-decker bus in which the upper-floor windows were blown out . police said they had sent armed officers to investigate an " incident " at university college hospital in central london .
a spokesman was unable to confirm reports on sky news about a man with a device with protruding wires attached to him seen in the area of the hospital .
police said the incident had been contained without providing further details . a city already traumatized stations at oval in southern london , warren street to the north and shepherd 's bush to the west were evacuated .
police said initial investigations of warren street and oval stations found no sign of chemical agents . four subway lines were temporarily shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copycat or same group ?
the blasts hit a city traumatized by the july 7 attacks , in which 56 people were killed including four suspected al-qaeda suicide bombers who blew up three subway trains and a double-decker bus . chaos , panic , witnesses say back on the streets , passengers who had fled the trains reported panic and chaos below ground . victoria line passenger ivan mccracken said he heard a traveler 's backpack had exploded on the subway outside warren street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosions two weeks ago were much more powerful , police officials said " i was in a middle carriage and the train was not far short of warren street station when suddenly the door between my carriage and the next one burst open and dozens of people started rushing through , some were falling and there was mass panic , " he told sky news . " it was difficult to get the story from any of them what had happened but when i got to ground level there was an italian young man comforting an italian girl who told me he had seen what had happened .
he said that a man was carrying a rucksack and the rucksack suddenly exploded .
it was a minor explosion but enough to blow open the rucksack .
the man then made an exclamation as if something had gone wrong .
at that point everyone rushed from the carriage . " " i could just smell smoke " another witness , abena adofo , 23 , told afp that people were running into her carriage .
" i could just smell smoke and i saw lots of people panicking , " she said .
" i was just trying to be calm and get out .
the smell of smoke was coming from the end of the carriage . " stagecoach , which owns the number 26 bus involved in the incident , said the driver heard a bang at around 12:30 p.m.
london time . the bus had left waterloo and was in the shoreditch neighborhood when the incident happened . " the driver heard a bang which appeared to come from the upper deck , " a spokesman told afp .
" when he went upstairs to investigate , the windows on the upper deck were blown out .
the bus is structurally intact and we do n't have any reports of injuries . " british prime minister tony blair urged the public to stay calm . " we know why these things are done - they are done to scare people , " he told reporters .
" fortunately , in this instance , there appear to have been no casualties ...
we 've got to react calmly .

ever since the german defense minister accused the iranian president of having been involved in terrorist activities , the diplomatic exchange between berlin and tehran has taken an unusually acrimonious tone . in an interview for the german weekly der spiegel , published monday , the german interior minister otto schily expressed his concern about " a fundamentalist coming to power in tehran . "
he was referring to mahmoud ahmadinejad , who was elected president of iran on june 24 . " we ca n't be certain that he -lrb- ahmadinejad -rrb- has absolutely distanced himself from terrorism , " schily said . the spokesperson of the iranian ministry of foreign affairs , hamid resa asefi , responded to schily 's criticism of the iranian president by calling it " unfounded and laughable " and advising the german minister " to express himself more carefully , get rid of the influence of zionist circles and respect democratic principles . " berlin strikes back in a rebuttal from the german ministry of the interior , rainer lingenstahl , the ministry spokesperson , referred to his iranian colleague 's statements on wednesday as " unbelievable outrageousness . " " it would be difficult to surpass the effrontery of such a voice from a country in which human rights are constantly abused , in which women are flogged as a consequence of dubious sentences , and in which critics of the regime , who have no access to legal support and appropriate legal procedures , are kept in isolation for months , " said lingenstahl . " if there is a place in which democratic principles ought to be respected , as my colleague from the iranian foreign ministry believes he needs to establish , then he should turn to his own country , " he said . a president with a shady past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's newly elected president mahmud ahmadinejad ahmadinejad has been accused of being one of the hardliners who took part in the attack on the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
he is also rumored to have been involved in a murder of an exiled iranian kurd politician and his two associates in vienna .
but the official investigation of the austrian authorities has produced no results , and neither of the two accusations have been proven . the growing tensions between iran and germany are possibly related to the stagnating negotiations about iran 's atomic weapons .
although great britain , france and germany insist that iran gives up its plans for accumulating uranium , iran has repeatedly turned down that request . the iranian spokesperson said his government would require an explanation from the german government for schily 's statements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parties not sanguine about eu-iran talks the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program .
-lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

but they did not . " we are a tolerant city , " police spokesman berkard jahn told reuters .
" we decided to let her go home with a verbal warning to dress appropriately next time . "
he said that decision was made because few people and presumably no small children saw her at that time of the day .

the decomposing body of the german shepherd , tied by a short length of blue rope , was discovered by a man walking his own dog in bonymaen .
the dog had been hidden in bracken in woodland and left to die in the heat .
rspca inspector neill manley said : " i suspect whoever did this took the dog there to kill it but just tied it up and left it there . "
the dog 's body had deteriorated so badly that it was impossible to determine the gender of the animal .
the remains have been removed pending a post mortem examination .
mr manley said : " someone in the area must know of someone or a family in the bonymaen or pentrechwyth area who had a german shepherd a few weeks ago but who does n't have one now .
" the only clue we have is the blue rope which was used to tie the dog to the tree .
it had cut into the animal 's flesh by the time the dog had died .
" this was a callous and cruel act of abandonment which resulted in the dog dying a slow and painful death completely unnecessarily , when there are a number of organisations that could have helped with rehoming . "
the body was found in forestry above brokesby road and was hidden within the undergrowth and trees about 20-30ft from a main path in the woods .
' depressed ' skink the discovery came as the rspca released figures which showed that the number of complaints about animal cruelty has continued to rise in wales .
in 2004 , the rspca dealt with 7,613 cases an increase of more than 1,000 on 2003 .
however , the number of convictions has dropped to 34 in 2004 compared to 47 the previous year .
in wales , the rspca also reported that 53 people ignored its advice and warnings in 2004 , compared to 28 in 2003 .
it highlighted the case of randall , a blue-tongued skink who was one of 25 exotic species , including 20 snakes , and 56 cats among the 166 animals removed from a house in gorseinon in swansea three years ago .
randall was severely underweight and " depressed " before he was given to a vet in merthyr tydfil , where he has since doubled his body weight due to regular feeding .
' duty of care ' the owners , who had tried to run an animal sanctuary , were later prosecuted for animal cruelty , but only after the society had made a number of visits to advise on animal care .
the rspca is hopeful the animal heath and welfare bill , currently making its way through this session of parliament , will help it to step in earlier to head off potential cruelty cases .
it sees the bill , which will give owners a duty of care towards their animals , as the most important legislation since the 1911 act from which it derives most of its powers .
mr manley said : " at the moment , if people refuse to act on the advice we give them , we have to just walk away .
we can only act after an animal has already suffered - and that means we have already failed .
" we want a law so that if people do n't give appropriate care , just simple things like access to water , food , shelter and space to express their normal behaviour , then that becomes an offence . "

the decomposing body of the german shepherd , tied by a short length of blue rope , was discovered by a man walking his own dog in bonymaen .
the dog had been hidden in bracken in woodland and left to die in the heat .
rspca inspector neill manley said : " i suspect whoever did this took the dog there to kill it but just tied it up and left it there . "
the dog 's body had deteriorated so badly that it was impossible to determine the gender of the animal .
the remains have been removed pending a post mortem examination .
mr manley said : " someone in the area must know of someone or a family in the bonymaen or pentrechwyth area who had a german shepherd a few weeks ago but who does n't have one now .
the german shepherd 's body was just yards from a path in woodland " the only clue we have is the blue rope which was used to tie the dog to the tree .
it had cut into the animal 's flesh by the time the dog had died .
" this was a callous and cruel act of abandonment which resulted in the dog dying a slow and painful death completely unnecessarily , when there are a number of organisations that could have helped with rehoming . "
the body was found in forestry above brokesby road and was hidden within the undergrowth and trees about 20-30ft from a main path in the woods .
' depressed ' skink the discovery came as the rspca released figures which showed that the number of complaints about animal cruelty has continued to rise in wales .
in 2004 , the rspca dealt with 7,613 cases an increase of more than 1,000 on 2003 .
however , the number of convictions has dropped to 34 in 2004 compared to 47 the previous year .
in wales , the rspca also reported that 53 people ignored its advice and warnings in 2004 , compared to 28 in 2003 .
it highlighted the case of randall , a blue-tongued skink who was one of 25 exotic species , including 20 snakes , and 56 cats among the 166 animals removed from a house in gorseinon in swansea three years ago .
randall was severely underweight and " depressed " before he was given to a vet in merthyr tydfil , where he has since doubled his body weight due to regular feeding .
' duty of care ' the owners , who had tried to run an animal sanctuary , were later prosecuted for animal cruelty , but only after the society had made a number of visits to advise on animal care .
the rspca is hopeful the animal heath and welfare bill , currently making its way through this session of parliament , will help it to step in earlier to head off potential cruelty cases .
it sees the bill , which will give owners a duty of care towards their animals , as the most important legislation since the 1911 act from which it derives most of its powers .
mr manley said : " at the moment , if people refuse to act on the advice we give them , we have to just walk away .
we can only act after an animal has already suffered - and that means we have already failed .
" we want a law so that if people do n't give appropriate care , just simple things like access to water , food , shelter and space to express their normal behaviour , then that becomes an offence . "

officers worked with trading standards and customs and excise on the a470 in the builth wells area .
three of the caravans were recovered off the show site .
elsewhere , welsh assembly presiding officer dafydd elis-thomas said some parts of laws outlawing hunting could be overturned with further devolution .
speaking on the operation to recover stolen caravans , a dyfed-powys police spokeswoman said : " from 6 to 18 july , powys police have been conducting an operation along the a470 in the immediate area of builth wells .
" there has been an excellent response from the public with many people approaching officers and commenting on the reassurance that the operation has given the local community . "
in march , police said there had been a spate of caravan thefts in powys which prompted a warning to owners .
thursday 's show wednesday 's attendance was 59,042 against 64,081 last year the campaign for the protection of rural wales launches its john muir award partnership the 101st show comes to an end seven throughout the county had been stolen since january , said dyfed-powys police at the time .
elsewhere at the show on wednesday , welsh assembly presiding officer dafydd elis-thomas said the ban on hunting with hounds could be overturned in wales if the uk government 's plans for further devolution became law .
lord elis-thomas said : " there is no reason why in the future some parts of the act banning hunting with dogs should not be devolved to the assembly , with the result that some hunting under licence could be allowed in wales . "
the wales office rejected his comments and said that hunting was not devolved and the uk government had no intention of revisiting the issue .
on monday , the parliamentary middle way group backed a petition calling for the assembly to have extra powers to amend the hunting act .
meanwhile , the welsh cob championship was won by a 13-year-old stallion owned by roger davies and malcolm cross from ebbw vale on wednesday .
the grandstand in the main ring was full to capacity , with some visitors queuing for more than two hours to catch a glimpse of the horses .

mr mandelson said the european commission should fill the political vacuum caused by the french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
the commission had to concentrate on economic growth and jobs , he said .
speaking in brussels , mr mandelson also said britain might have to compromise " for the common european good " .
with blair in the presidency and barroso at the commission we can start the battle to make the idea of europe live again peter mandelson he accused some of the bigger countries in core europe of having an emotional block about economic reform .
addressing a brussels conference of the european policy centre and the university association for contemporary university studies -lrb- uaces -rrb- , he said the commission 's leadership had been eroded .
mr mandelson said it had " to put itself into the driving seat , providing more of the leadership that our member states and public crave " .
" i am not advocating a bout of regulatory hyperactivity on the commission 's part .
what we need is focus and impact , " he said .
' leadership opportunity ' with britain currently holding the presidency of the european union , mr mandelson said tony blair had a real opportunity for leadership as well .
but he warned there were four conditions britain would need to meet : " first , as the government has begun to do , if britain does not always claim a monopoly of virtue - that the brits have got everything right and the continentals everything wrong .
" second , if britain argues for reform from a pro european perspective - not to cut back and limit europe in order to return powers to the nation state .
" third , if britain does not exaggerate its case , for example on the cap where the real issue is the pace and direction of reform , not whether the cap should be scrapped , as margaret beckett has made clear .
" fourth , if britain shows a willingness to compromise for the common european good on the argument that it is more in britain 's interest that europe moves forward than she wins on every last point . "
mr mandelson said the commission was the only organisation that could persuade member states to live up to their responsibilities .

mr mandelson said the european commission should fill the political vacuum caused by the french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
the commission had to concentrate on economic growth and jobs , he said .
speaking in brussels , mr mandelson also said britain might have to compromise " for the common european good " .
with blair in the presidency and barroso at the commission we can start the battle to make the idea of europe live again peter mandelson he accused some of the bigger countries in core europe of having an emotional block about economic reform .
addressing a brussels conference of the european policy centre and the university association for contemporary university studies -lrb- uaces -rrb- , he said the commission 's leadership had been eroded .
mr mandelson said it had " to put itself into the driving seat , providing more of the leadership that our member states and public crave " .
" i am not advocating a bout of regulatory hyperactivity on the commission 's part .
what we need is focus and impact , " he said .
' leadership opportunity ' with britain currently holding the presidency of the european union , mr mandelson said tony blair had a real opportunity for leadership as well .
but he warned there were four conditions britain would need to meet : " first , as the government has begun to do , if britain does not always claim a monopoly of virtue - that the brits have got everything right and the continentals everything wrong .
" second , if britain argues for reform from a pro european perspective - not to cut back and limit europe in order to return powers to the nation state .
" third , if britain does not exaggerate its case , for example on the cap where the real issue is the pace and direction of reform , not whether the cap should be scrapped , as margaret beckett has made clear .
" fourth , if britain shows a willingness to compromise for the common european good on the argument that it is more in britain 's interest that europe moves forward than she wins on every last point . "
mr mandelson said the commission was the only organisation that could persuade member states to live up to their responsibilities .
" europe has been on the defensive for too long .
let us go on the attack .
" with blair in the presidency and barroso at the commission we can start the battle to make the idea of europe live again . "

one woman , karen barrett , said she was going to sit at the site of the orange mast in byron avenue , winchester , hants , for 24 hours until thursday .
the protesters are concerned about the potential health dangers of the mast , which began being built last week .
in march , the house of lords refused to overturn a decision allowing the mast .
the court of appeal earlier dismissed opposition to the plan .
the case was brought in the names of two children that live near the mast - phoebe st leger-davey , six , and seven-year-old james harrison .
lawyers for the children told the court that they lived and went to school within 250 to 300 metres of the mast site and within the " zone of greatest intensity of electromagnetic emissions " .
the children wanted an order overturning a planning inspector 's decision last august giving the go-ahead for the 11.79 metre-high mast in the cul-de-sac .
it was argued that orange should have gone to the county court and challenged the refusal of the owners of two alternative sites - the roof of hampshire police headquarters and the car park at winchester railway station - to allow the mast to be erected .
but the appeal judges held there was no legal obligation on a mobile phone operator to take such court action .

one woman , karen barrett , said she was going to sit at the site of the orange mast in byron avenue , winchester , hants , for 24 hours until thursday .
the protesters are concerned about the potential health dangers of the mast , which began being built last week .
in march , the house of lords refused to overturn a decision allowing the mast .
the court of appeal earlier dismissed opposition to the plan .
the case was brought in the names of two children that live near the mast - phoebe st leger-davey , six , and seven-year-old james harrison .
construction work on the mast began last week lawyers for the children told the court that they lived and went to school within 250 to 300 metres of the mast site and within the " zone of greatest intensity of electromagnetic emissions " .
the children wanted an order overturning a planning inspector 's decision last august giving the go-ahead for the 11.79 metre-high mast in the cul-de-sac .
it was argued that orange should have gone to the county court and challenged the refusal of the owners of two alternative sites - the roof of hampshire police headquarters and the car park at winchester railway station - to allow the mast to be erected .
but the appeal judges held there was no legal obligation on a mobile phone operator to take such court action .

the retailer is the latest to report that consumer demand is sputtering .
on wednesday gus and clinton cards said retail conditions were " challenging " .
increased competition , higher interest rates and more expensive petrol are all taking their toll , analysts have said .
' tough market ' " conditions on the high street are difficult , competition is intense and there is nothing to suggest this will change in the coming months , " said richard baker , chief executive of boots .
" this is a reasonable performance in a tough market , against our strongest trading period last year . "
overall sales at boots the chemist rose 1.5 % during the fiscal first quarter .
for the boots group as a whole , revenues were up 1.9 % on a year earlier .
boots said that " the quarter saw good performance in beauty , with particularly good growth in cosmetics " , adding that it planned to invest more money in that part of its business .
" toiletries also performed well , " the company said , though " sales were weaker in the lifestyle categories , with continued decline in the photo market and a slow start to summer ranges " .
the company said it expected to complete the sale of its boots healthcare international division by the end of this year .
analysts have valued the healthcare division , which makes strepsils sore-throat pastilles and nurofen pain killers , at just over £ 1bn .

everyone gets a chance to be a dj for a night " we wanted to do something where people could come and share music , " explained mr gower .
" the concept of sharing music was getting bigger and bigger at that time . "
the pair hit upon the idea of encouraging friends to bring their mp3 players to their local bar in london and give everyone the chance of being a dj for the night .
" the concept was that this was something anyone could .
music and dj-ing are very elitist .
' share music ' mr gower said : " we wanted everybody to get involved , play music to each other and essentially share music .

mr panjwani added : " it is the crowd playing to the crowd .

a list of the music played at each nowax party is posted on a dedicated website .
a typical evening can mix hardcore dance music , ska music from the 1970s , rock , pop and soul .
the types of music played can vary enormously mr gower said : " people are getting exposed to a lot more music because of mp3 players .
a lot of them hold 10,000 songs and that is a lot of albums .
" you hardly ever find people who just have 60s music or one genre .
you 'll find people have sweet little folk songs as well as some brutal aphex twin . "
when it works it is very communal , said mr panjwani .
" you can really see people 's personalities come through .
" when we have done nights in bars , when there is no dancing , people will purposefully try and throw in something that is obscure or slightly jarring . "

everyone gets a chance to be a dj for a night " we wanted to do something where people could come and share music , " explained mr gower .
" the concept of sharing music was getting bigger and bigger at that time . "
the pair hit upon the idea of encouraging friends to bring their mp3 players to their local bar in london and give everyone the chance of being a dj for the night .
" the concept was that this was something anyone could .
music and dj-ing are very elitist .
' share music ' mr gower said : " we wanted everybody to get involved , play music to each other and essentially share music .
it would n't be about just the dj playing to the crowd . "
mr panjwani added : " it is the crowd playing to the crowd .
we started doing it and people started really liking it . "
' my night as a digital dj ' in 2003 the pair set up nowax , an organisation that would encourage people to share their music at live events via mp3 players .
two years later and nowax events have been held in japan , usa , austria and 10 different cities in the uk .
there is no charge for the service , which includes instructions for how to host a nowax party , and graphics for posters and flyers to advertise the event .
" we let people play three tracks .
but they play their tracks alternately against someone else , " said mr panjwani .
' battle ' " it 's like an old hip hop style battle .
it becomes an engaging organic thing .
someone plays a track then someone can react to that , " added mr gower .
" a lot of people have an expectation that it will be like a club night , with dance music , but invariably it is never really like that , " said mr panjwani , adding : " the music goes all over the place . "
a list of the music played at each nowax party is posted on a dedicated website .
a typical evening can mix hardcore dance music , ska music from the 1970s , rock , pop and soul .
the types of music played can vary enormously mr gower said : " people are getting exposed to a lot more music because of mp3 players .
a lot of them hold 10,000 songs and that is a lot of albums .
" you hardly ever find people who just have 60s music or one genre .
you 'll find people have sweet little folk songs as well as some brutal aphex twin . "
when it works it is very communal , said mr panjwani .
" you can really see people 's personalities come through .
" when we have done nights in bars , when there is no dancing , people will purposefully try and throw in something that is obscure or slightly jarring . "

from blogging to podcasting , millions of ordinary people are becoming writers , journalists , broadcasters and film-makers thanks to increasingly affordable and accessible tools .
how would i fare as a digital dj for a night ?
now i know how fatboy slim feels .
i too have stood exposed at the decks , the crowd hanging on to my every tune , swaying to the hypnotic beats i serve up .
well , almost .
today 's djs are be superstars , who earn their crust through a mix of performance , musical knowledge and skill with the all-important vinyl .
but can the digital age sweep away these highly-paid djs and replace them with citizen djs ?
that is the thrust of nowax - evenings devised by two friends raj panjwani and charlie gower who want people to bring their own music to the pub or club .
the premise is simple - people can bring along an mp3 player to a nowax night and then get a chance to play three selected tunes to the crowd .
the idea has been so successful that nowax nights have sprung up around the world - in tokyo , detroit , vienna and singapore .
after interviewing raj and charlie i fancied my chances as a dj and signed myself up for the second anniversary nowax party in shoreditch , east london .
with more than 4,600 songs on my ipod i was confident i could find three that would get the crowd on its feet .
but which three ?
nowax parties are structured like a head-to-head battle .
there are effectively three rounds of action as a pair of djs take turns to play one of their three songs , in an effort to bounce off each other .
in the days leading up to the event i was scouring my mp3 player looking for tracks that would be popular and imbued a sense of cool .
i was not hopeful .
my search continued , album by album and track by track until i found the song i knew i would play first - goldfrapp 's strict machine , a rousing , beating , thunderous pop track i believed would get the crowd going .
i was more than a little nervous when i arrived at the bar - populated as it was by the shabby chic , whose mp3 players were no doubt replete with soothing vibes and irresistible beats .
round one i took my place at the decks and mixer , mp3 player at the ready , adopting a nonchalant stance of cool indifference .
but the bravado drained from me when my rival played his first track .
it was undeniably hip , and the word urban sprang to mind .
i knew there was nothing remotely " urban " on my ipod .
flustered by his track i stuck to my original choice and as his soothing song ended my pounding number began .
the contrast was brutal .
the 100 or so people in the bar flinched and instead of tapping toes and fingers they merely leaned in and tried to continue their conversations .
round two my rival dj , tom , selected his next track , his final selection , and again i knew i had nothing in my arsenal to match it .
panicked , i scrolled frantically through my song lists , desperately seeking something , anything uplifting .
as his track faded out i stabbed the play button wildly on my ipod and leftfield 's open up , featuring john lydon screeched out .
a bombastic rant of a dance track , it sounded wildly inappropriate for nine o 'clock on a thursday evening .
the crowd hunched further over their drinks as they absorbed my aural assault .
i now had one song left to redeem myself but was still confident because i knew my next dj rival was a bbc radio five live reporter , ross , who had earlier confessed to me that his mp3 player was mainly full of classical music .
round three mercifully , i faded out leftfield early and awaited my bbc colleague 's selection .
expecting bach or mahler , i was dumbfounded when c 'mon c 'mon by the von bondies played out .
the five live man had cheated - not wanting to disgrace himself he had researched playlists at previous nowax parties and had downloaded a track he knew that had been played before .
by now i was punch drunk and beaten .
my final track was meaningless so i chose a dance remix of an old jean michel jarre track , chronologie part six .
there was barely a ripple of reaction from the crowd .
the song ended and i gathered up my mp3 player and tried to make a discreet exit from the bar .
as i left , the bar was engaged in a raucous sing-a-long to the kinks ' sunny afternoon .
i had wildly misinterpreted the mood of the audience and stupidly overinflated the quality of a music collection .
did fatboy slim ever feel this way ?

all this week the bbc news website is speaking to people whose creativity has been transformed in the digital age .
from blogging to podcasting , millions of ordinary people are becoming writers , journalists , broadcasters and film-makers thanks to increasingly affordable and accessible tools .
how would i fare as a digital dj for a night ?
now i know how fatboy slim feels .

well , almost .
today 's djs are be superstars , who earn their crust through a mix of performance , musical knowledge and skill with the all-important vinyl .
but can the digital age sweep away these highly-paid djs and replace them with citizen djs ?
that is the thrust of nowax - evenings devised by two friends raj panjwani and charlie gower who want people to bring their own music to the pub or club .
the premise is simple - people can bring along an mp3 player to a nowax night and then get a chance to play three selected tunes to the crowd .
desperately looking for a song to please the crowd the idea has been so successful that nowax nights have sprung up around the world - in tokyo , detroit , vienna and singapore .
after interviewing raj and charlie i fancied my chances as a dj and signed myself up for the second anniversary nowax party in shoreditch , east london .
with more than 4,600 songs on my ipod i was confident i could find three that would get the crowd on its feet .
but which three ?
nowax parties are structured like a head-to-head battle .
there are effectively three rounds of action as a pair of djs take turns to play one of their three songs , in an effort to bounce off each other .
in the days leading up to the event i was scouring my mp3 player looking for tracks that would be popular and imbued a sense of cool .
i was not hopeful .
my search continued , album by album and track by track until i found the song i knew i would play first - goldfrapp 's strict machine , a rousing , beating , thunderous pop track i believed would get the crowd going .
i was more than a little nervous when i arrived at the bar - populated as it was by the shabby chic , whose mp3 players were no doubt replete with soothing vibes and irresistible beats .
round one i took my place at the decks and mixer , mp3 player at the ready , adopting a nonchalant stance of cool indifference .
but the bravado drained from me when my rival played his first track .
it was undeniably hip , and the word urban sprang to mind .
i knew there was nothing remotely " urban " on my ipod .
flustered by his track i stuck to my original choice and as his soothing song ended my pounding number began .
the contrast was brutal .
the 100 or so people in the bar flinched and instead of tapping toes and fingers they merely leaned in and tried to continue their conversations .
round two my rival dj , tom , selected his next track , his final selection , and again i knew i had nothing in my arsenal to match it .
my choice of music creates barely a ripple of interest panicked , i scrolled frantically through my song lists , desperately seeking something , anything uplifting .
as his track faded out i stabbed the play button wildly on my ipod and leftfield 's open up , featuring john lydon screeched out .
a bombastic rant of a dance track , it sounded wildly inappropriate for nine o 'clock on a thursday evening .
the crowd hunched further over their drinks as they absorbed my aural assault .
