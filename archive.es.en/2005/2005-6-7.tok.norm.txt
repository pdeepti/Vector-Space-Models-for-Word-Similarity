german foreign minister joschka fischer will hold talks in washington on wednesday with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
transatlantic ties and germany 's bid for a un security coucil seat top the agenda . fischer left germany on monday and briefly stopped over in lisbon for talks with portuguese leaders on the crisis of the eu after french and dutch voters rejected the bloc 's new constitution in referendums last week . discussions in washington , scheduled to take place on tuesday and wednesday , will focus on transatlantic relations as well as on the situation in germany after chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants early elections in the fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer welcomed rice in berlin in 2004 that 's why fischer will have to dispel the impression that he is a lame duck foreign minister as his greens party is highly likely not to be in power come september .
as a result , fischer 's first visit to condoleezza rice in her capacity as united states secretary of state could well be his fare-well trip to washington . useless veto rights ? but there are a number of unresolved issues on the bilateral agenda - most notably the schröder government 's bid to win a permanent seat in the security council of a reformed united nations .
with german-american relations barely mended after a major fallout over the iraq war , the bush administration is reluctant to give support to the idea .
germany , japan , brazil and india have teamed up in a joint effort to become permanent council members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york in his talks with rice , fischer is expected to elaborate on a new german proposal that the country should be given privileged veto rights but combined with a german commitment not to exercise them .
germany is the third biggest financial contributor to the united nations and its un ambassador gunther pleuger is confident that the plan will find enough support in the world body . " our proposal has n't meet resistance so far , " he said .
" quite the contrary , there is increasing support for the idea in our discussions with all united nations ' members and in the political debates with major governments . " however , it 's still far from certain if fischer can win the support of the bush administration , which is said to favor the bids of japan and india .
and time is fast running out for schröder to achieve this key goal of his foreign policy agenda .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to present final recommendations for reform in september , only a few days before early elections in germany . do n't mention the nukes in an attempt to further improve transatlantic ties , joschka fischer will also refrain from touching the hot domestic issue of american nuclear weapons based in germany .
german regional leaders have urged fischer to press for the total withdrawal of such weapons which have remained in the country after the collapse of the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protesting against us nuclear warheads in europe earlier this year defense minister peter struck still vowed to make the nukes an issue during nato meetings .
but he has shied away from it after the united states secretly began repatriating most of their 150 nuclear missiles in germany .
at the moment 20 such weapons remain here . iran 's nuclear weapons program as well as support for iraqi reconstruction will also be on fischer 's agenda .
german assistance in training iraqi military and security personnel welcomed by washington and has contributed to a thaw in relations .
there was talk of a new chapter that should be opened in bilateral relations . with the prospect of a more bush-friendly conservative german government looming large on the horizon , this could happen faster than joschka fischer might have wished . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china against german un reform plans chinese-japanese relations and wartime past are affecting the proposed reforms of the united nations security council , possibly thwarting german attempts to secure a permanent seat on the council on its own terms .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .
the people in brussels will have to respect that .

germany defeated northern ireland 4-1 with 10 men on saturday and klinsmann wants another shot in the arm ahead of the confederations cup , which starts on june 15 .
" we want to keep the run going although russia will prove more of a test than northern ireland , " he said .
" some of the players may be feeling the strains of playing twice in quick succession but that will happen in the world cup too . "
the last time the two nations met was back in euro 96 when klinsmann scored twice to clinch a 3-0 win as germany went on to be crowned european champions .
russia improved their chances of making it to the world cup in germany with a 2-0 qualifying win over latvia , but coach juri sjomin was still far from happy .
" our defense is concerning me , " he said .
" we are often too exposed on the counter attack .
latvia had chances .
we were just lucky they did not take them . " dw-world.de interview : klinsmann cool under pressure jürgen klinsmann took the reigns of germany 's national soccer team almost a year ago .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 blair gets african aid pledge from bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is confident bush will open the white house coffers for africa us president george bush was to pledge $ 674 million in new aid for africa at a summit on tuesday with british leader tony blair .
but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .
12 , 1955 , which was also the 200th birthday of prussian general and military reformer , gerhard von scharnhorst , the first 101 volunteer soldiers were sworn in . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de students on target for the bundeswehr as germany 's defense ministry and its armed forces prepare to celebrate 50 years of existence , the german army - the bundeswehr - continues to raise its profile by giving students the opportunity to handle firearms .

officials also announced possible action against portugal . in a move that risked setting it on a collision course with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the eu 's executive arm noted that italy 's public deficit has exceeded the eu ceiling in both 2003 and 2004 . it said the excessive deficit , well beyond the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , could not be blamed on exceptional circumstances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 blair gets african aid pledge from bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is confident bush will open the white house coffers for africa us president george bush was to pledge $ 674 million in new aid for africa at a summit on tuesday with british leader tony blair .
but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu crisis has buffeted the euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution . the eu finance ministers , who have been at pains to ensure that the political fiasco after the french and dutch rejected the constitution does not take on an economic dimension as well , sought at their two-day meeting to show the eu at work rather than in turmoil . however , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who hosted the ministers meeting , acknowledged that the political crisis having an economic impact . " it 's true that at first sight the current state of europe does n't inspire confidence either amongst domestic consumers or foreign investors who are looking at us from afar and are finding it more and more difficult to understand , " he told journalists . but he insisted that the best way to restore confidence was to show business as usual in the run up to a june 16-17 summit of eu leaders in brussels , which will decide the fate of the beleaguered constitution . " i think that those who claim to be running europe , if you run europe you have to run it properly and use the next two weeks to show both to domestic consumers and those outside the european union that we are capable of making decisions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker he insisted the best way forward would be for member states to strike a deal on the 25-nation 's long term budget , which has so far torn deep divisions between them .
but although a brief discussion of the budget was officially on the agenda of tuesday 's meeting here , no breakthroughs were expected . british rebate juncker is meeting regularly with eu leaders in hope of brokering an agreement on the eu budget to be inked at the upcoming summit .
however , britain 's refusal to budge on its rebate from contributions to the eu budget has so far held up progress , which is likely to stall for some time if a deal is not struck before london takes over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency in july . despite the budget impasse , the ministers had a bevy of topics on the table - ranging from dutch finances to savings tax and development aid financing - to keep them busy and give the air of business as usual amid the signs of crisis . so far , the economic toll of the constitution fiasco has been directed on the euro , after two italian ministers suggested that italy would better off with out it .
last week italian social affairs minister roberto maroni - a member of the euroskeptic northern league - suggested italy should reintroduce the lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that assertion was backed monday by italian reform minister roberto calderoli - also a northern league member - who suggested rome could return to the lira , or even create a new currency pegged to the us dollar . defending the euro such comments have put euro-zone officials on the defensive with counter attacks insisting that the single european currency is one of the most successful projects of eu integration ever under taken . " it 's a huge success , we all must see the progress we made -lrb- with the euro -rrb- , the positive effects that we 're having in terms of as far as lower interest rates , as far as lower inflation , as far as the increase in growth is concerned , " austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser said . but some economists believe that the political crisis , which is unlikely to be solved quickly , will continue to weigh on the euro for some time . " political uncertainty , economic stagnation and growing skepticism about the potential for ecb -lrb- european central bank -rrb- rate hikes until next year are leading to broad-based euro weakness , and we find little to reverse that trend in the near future , " said bank of america analyst robert sinche , forecasting the euro will fall to 1.19 dollars by year-end . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .
the people in brussels will have to respect that .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament .

they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .
the people in brussels will have to respect that .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu crisis has buffeted the euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution . the eu finance ministers , who have been at pains to ensure that the political fiasco after the french and dutch rejected the constitution does not take on an economic dimension as well , sought at their two-day meeting to show the eu at work rather than in turmoil . however , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who hosted the ministers meeting , acknowledged that the political crisis having an economic impact . " it 's true that at first sight the current state of europe does n't inspire confidence either amongst domestic consumers or foreign investors who are looking at us from afar and are finding it more and more difficult to understand , " he told journalists . but he insisted that the best way to restore confidence was to show business as usual in the run up to a june 16-17 summit of eu leaders in brussels , which will decide the fate of the beleaguered constitution . " i think that those who claim to be running europe , if you run europe you have to run it properly and use the next two weeks to show both to domestic consumers and those outside the european union that we are capable of making decisions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker he insisted the best way forward would be for member states to strike a deal on the 25-nation 's long term budget , which has so far torn deep divisions between them .
but although a brief discussion of the budget was officially on the agenda of tuesday 's meeting here , no breakthroughs were expected . british rebate juncker is meeting regularly with eu leaders in hope of brokering an agreement on the eu budget to be inked at the upcoming summit .
however , britain 's refusal to budge on its rebate from contributions to the eu budget has so far held up progress , which is likely to stall for some time if a deal is not struck before london takes over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency in july . despite the budget impasse , the ministers had a bevy of topics on the table - ranging from dutch finances to savings tax and development aid financing - to keep them busy and give the air of business as usual amid the signs of crisis . so far , the economic toll of the constitution fiasco has been directed on the euro , after two italian ministers suggested that italy would better off with out it .
last week italian social affairs minister roberto maroni - a member of the euroskeptic northern league - suggested italy should reintroduce the lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that assertion was backed monday by italian reform minister roberto calderoli - also a northern league member - who suggested rome could return to the lira , or even create a new currency pegged to the us dollar . defending the euro such comments have put euro-zone officials on the defensive with counter attacks insisting that the single european currency is one of the most successful projects of eu integration ever under taken . " it 's a huge success , we all must see the progress we made -lrb- with the euro -rrb- , the positive effects that we 're having in terms of as far as lower interest rates , as far as lower inflation , as far as the increase in growth is concerned , " austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser said . but some economists believe that the political crisis , which is unlikely to be solved quickly , will continue to weigh on the euro for some time . " political uncertainty , economic stagnation and growing skepticism about the potential for ecb -lrb- european central bank -rrb- rate hikes until next year are leading to broad-based euro weakness , and we find little to reverse that trend in the near future , " said bank of america analyst robert sinche , forecasting the euro will fall to 1.19 dollars by year-end . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .
-lrb- june 5 , 2005 -rrb- euro caught in constitution crossfire will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- expected french ' non ' hits euro the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.06.2005 fischer heads to us to push un reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will this be fischer 's last trip to washington as foreign minister ?
german foreign minister joschka fischer will hold talks in washington on wednesday with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
transatlantic ties and germany 's bid for a un security coucil seat top the agenda . fischer left germany on monday and briefly stopped over in lisbon for talks with portuguese leaders on the crisis of the eu after french and dutch voters rejected the bloc 's new constitution in referendums last week . discussions in washington , scheduled to take place on tuesday and wednesday , will focus on transatlantic relations as well as on the situation in germany after chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants early elections in the fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer welcomed rice in berlin in 2004 that 's why fischer will have to dispel the impression that he is a lame duck foreign minister as his greens party is highly likely not to be in power come september .
as a result , fischer 's first visit to condoleezza rice in her capacity as united states secretary of state could well be his fare-well trip to washington . useless veto rights ? but there are a number of unresolved issues on the bilateral agenda - most notably the schröder government 's bid to win a permanent seat in the security council of a reformed united nations .
with german-american relations barely mended after a major fallout over the iraq war , the bush administration is reluctant to give support to the idea .
germany , japan , brazil and india have teamed up in a joint effort to become permanent council members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york in his talks with rice , fischer is expected to elaborate on a new german proposal that the country should be given privileged veto rights but combined with a german commitment not to exercise them .
germany is the third biggest financial contributor to the united nations and its un ambassador gunther pleuger is confident that the plan will find enough support in the world body . " our proposal has n't meet resistance so far , " he said .
" quite the contrary , there is increasing support for the idea in our discussions with all united nations ' members and in the political debates with major governments . " however , it 's still far from certain if fischer can win the support of the bush administration , which is said to favor the bids of japan and india .
and time is fast running out for schröder to achieve this key goal of his foreign policy agenda .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to present final recommendations for reform in september , only a few days before early elections in germany . do n't mention the nukes in an attempt to further improve transatlantic ties , joschka fischer will also refrain from touching the hot domestic issue of american nuclear weapons based in germany .
german regional leaders have urged fischer to press for the total withdrawal of such weapons which have remained in the country after the collapse of the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protesting against us nuclear warheads in europe earlier this year defense minister peter struck still vowed to make the nukes an issue during nato meetings .
but he has shied away from it after the united states secretly began repatriating most of their 150 nuclear missiles in germany .
at the moment 20 such weapons remain here . iran 's nuclear weapons program as well as support for iraqi reconstruction will also be on fischer 's agenda .
german assistance in training iraqi military and security personnel welcomed by washington and has contributed to a thaw in relations .
there was talk of a new chapter that should be opened in bilateral relations . with the prospect of a more bush-friendly conservative german government looming large on the horizon , this could happen faster than joschka fischer might have wished . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china against german un reform plans chinese-japanese relations and wartime past are affecting the proposed reforms of the united nations security council , possibly thwarting german attempts to secure a permanent seat on the council on its own terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 eu backs french cnn rival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cnn 's iraq coverage convinced france to pursue its own channel the european commission gave its green light tuesday to plans for a french international television news network to rival the bbc and cnn , saying the project does not breach eu state aid rules . the french international news channel -lrb- cfii -rrb- is a joint operation between state broadcaster france television and the private channel tf1 , with the government providing 30 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- to get it started . " i am delighted that the commission has been able to give the go-ahead to this project for a public-service television channel , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes . the commission said that , although the project involved state aid , " it could nevertheless be authorized as a project financing a service of general economic interest . " " the commission also concluded that the project offered sufficient guarantees against the risk of distortion of competition , for example by preventing unjustified transfers of public funds to france television and tf1 , who will be shareholders in the future channel , " it said . chirac unhappy at ' biased ' iraq reporting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac president jacques chirac championed the idea of the new network during the diplomatic spat with the united states in the run-up to the iraq war .
he was said to be unhappy with the way french policies were presented on international stations such as britain 's bbc world and the us-based cnn . jo gröbel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " gröbel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " president 's pet project realized but a french-language international television channel has been one of chirac 's pet projects for some time .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , the french president has championed the creation of such a channel for over three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then , in an interim report in 2003 , parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war from the western viewpoint with al-jazeera the main broadcaster in the arab world . the conclusion of that report was for the french to push for the channel that has now been approved .
the programs will mostly be in french , although english and other languages would also be used , and , though they would be beamed to several countries , they will not be seen in france itself - limiting the attraction for french advertisers . doubts over french-language audience " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo gröbel added .
" undoubtedly there is enough interest for francophone news in french .
the question is who it would be aimed at who is not already reached by -lrb- swiss run -rrb- tv5 or radio france international . " in any case , though , such a channel would add to global news pluralism , gröbel said .
" from the political point of view , it makes sense for the french ' slash ' europeans to have a broader view , " he said .
" there is definitely room for a fourth global player . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cnn à la francaise france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu crisis has buffeted the euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution . the eu finance ministers , who have been at pains to ensure that the political fiasco after the french and dutch rejected the constitution does not take on an economic dimension as well , sought at their two-day meeting to show the eu at work rather than in turmoil . however , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who hosted the ministers meeting , acknowledged that the political crisis having an economic impact . " it 's true that at first sight the current state of europe does n't inspire confidence either amongst domestic consumers or foreign investors who are looking at us from afar and are finding it more and more difficult to understand , " he told journalists . but he insisted that the best way to restore confidence was to show business as usual in the run up to a june 16-17 summit of eu leaders in brussels , which will decide the fate of the beleaguered constitution . " i think that those who claim to be running europe , if you run europe you have to run it properly and use the next two weeks to show both to domestic consumers and those outside the european union that we are capable of making decisions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker he insisted the best way forward would be for member states to strike a deal on the 25-nation 's long term budget , which has so far torn deep divisions between them .
but although a brief discussion of the budget was officially on the agenda of tuesday 's meeting here , no breakthroughs were expected . british rebate juncker is meeting regularly with eu leaders in hope of brokering an agreement on the eu budget to be inked at the upcoming summit .
however , britain 's refusal to budge on its rebate from contributions to the eu budget has so far held up progress , which is likely to stall for some time if a deal is not struck before london takes over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency in july . despite the budget impasse , the ministers had a bevy of topics on the table - ranging from dutch finances to savings tax and development aid financing - to keep them busy and give the air of business as usual amid the signs of crisis . so far , the economic toll of the constitution fiasco has been directed on the euro , after two italian ministers suggested that italy would better off with out it .
last week italian social affairs minister roberto maroni - a member of the euroskeptic northern league - suggested italy should reintroduce the lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that assertion was backed monday by italian reform minister roberto calderoli - also a northern league member - who suggested rome could return to the lira , or even create a new currency pegged to the us dollar . defending the euro such comments have put euro-zone officials on the defensive with counter attacks insisting that the single european currency is one of the most successful projects of eu integration ever under taken . " it 's a huge success , we all must see the progress we made -lrb- with the euro -rrb- , the positive effects that we 're having in terms of as far as lower interest rates , as far as lower inflation , as far as the increase in growth is concerned , " austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser said . but some economists believe that the political crisis , which is unlikely to be solved quickly , will continue to weigh on the euro for some time . " political uncertainty , economic stagnation and growing skepticism about the potential for ecb -lrb- european central bank -rrb- rate hikes until next year are leading to broad-based euro weakness , and we find little to reverse that trend in the near future , " said bank of america analyst robert sinche , forecasting the euro will fall to 1.19 dollars by year-end . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .
-lrb- june 5 , 2005 -rrb- euro caught in constitution crossfire will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .
12 , 1955 , which was also the 200th birthday of prussian general and military reformer , gerhard von scharnhorst , the first 101 volunteer soldiers were sworn in . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de students on target for the bundeswehr as germany 's defense ministry and its armed forces prepare to celebrate 50 years of existence , the german army - the bundeswehr - continues to raise its profile by giving students the opportunity to handle firearms .

german foreign minister joschka fischer will hold talks in washington on wednesday with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
transatlantic ties and germany 's bid for a un security coucil seat top the agenda . fischer left germany on monday and briefly stopped over in lisbon for talks with portuguese leaders on the crisis of the eu after french and dutch voters rejected the bloc 's new constitution in referendums last week . discussions in washington , scheduled to take place on tuesday and wednesday , will focus on transatlantic relations as well as on the situation in germany after chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants early elections in the fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer welcomed rice in berlin in 2004 that 's why fischer will have to dispel the impression that he is a lame duck foreign minister as his greens party is highly likely not to be in power come september .
as a result , fischer 's first visit to condoleezza rice in her capacity as united states secretary of state could well be his fare-well trip to washington . useless veto rights ? but there are a number of unresolved issues on the bilateral agenda - most notably the schröder government 's bid to win a permanent seat in the security council of a reformed united nations .
with german-american relations barely mended after a major fallout over the iraq war , the bush administration is reluctant to give support to the idea .
germany , japan , brazil and india have teamed up in a joint effort to become permanent council members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york in his talks with rice , fischer is expected to elaborate on a new german proposal that the country should be given privileged veto rights but combined with a german commitment not to exercise them .
germany is the third biggest financial contributor to the united nations and its un ambassador gunther pleuger is confident that the plan will find enough support in the world body . " our proposal has n't meet resistance so far , " he said .
" quite the contrary , there is increasing support for the idea in our discussions with all united nations ' members and in the political debates with major governments . " however , it 's still far from certain if fischer can win the support of the bush administration , which is said to favor the bids of japan and india .
and time is fast running out for schröder to achieve this key goal of his foreign policy agenda .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to present final recommendations for reform in september , only a few days before early elections in germany . do n't mention the nukes in an attempt to further improve transatlantic ties , joschka fischer will also refrain from touching the hot domestic issue of american nuclear weapons based in germany .
german regional leaders have urged fischer to press for the total withdrawal of such weapons which have remained in the country after the collapse of the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protesting against us nuclear warheads in europe earlier this year defense minister peter struck still vowed to make the nukes an issue during nato meetings .
but he has shied away from it after the united states secretly began repatriating most of their 150 nuclear missiles in germany .
at the moment 20 such weapons remain here . iran 's nuclear weapons program as well as support for iraqi reconstruction will also be on fischer 's agenda .
german assistance in training iraqi military and security personnel welcomed by washington and has contributed to a thaw in relations .
there was talk of a new chapter that should be opened in bilateral relations . with the prospect of a more bush-friendly conservative german government looming large on the horizon , this could happen faster than joschka fischer might have wished . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china against german un reform plans chinese-japanese relations and wartime past are affecting the proposed reforms of the united nations security council , possibly thwarting german attempts to secure a permanent seat on the council on its own terms .

officials also announced possible action against portugal . in a move that risked setting it on a collision course with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the eu 's executive arm noted that italy 's public deficit has exceeded the eu ceiling in both 2003 and 2004 . it said the excessive deficit , well beyond the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , could not be blamed on exceptional circumstances . " the excess of the deficit over the reference value is not exceptional , as defined by the pact ... nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn , " conditions which may have won rome a reprieve , the commission said in a report . euro zone 's biggest public deficit italy is currently in a mild recession and its public deficit is the largest in the 12-nation euro zone .
the italian government has acknowledged that it will exceed the eu 's ceiling again this year . the commission said italy 's deficit " has been above the reference value for two years and , according to the commission 's spring forecast , it will be well above 3.0 percent in 2005 and 2006 , even if economic growth returned to its potential rate . " " recent government announcements reinforce this projection , " it said . the commission 's excessive deficit action and recommendations will be examined by eu finance ministers at their next meeting on july 11 and 12 . finance minister calls for reason bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian finance minister domenico siniscalco , right , shares a word with fellow pact breaker german finance minister hans eichel left .
greek finance minister george alogoskoufis looks on .
in luxembourg , italian finance minister domenico siniscalco -lrb- photo , left -rrb- immediately issued a call for reason and said he hoped that his eu partners would give rome at least two years , until 2007 , to bring the deficit back into line .
" i am fighting for a reasonable solution , " he said .
" this is not an examination but an attempt between partners to find a solution that is in everybody 's interest . " the move came as the italian government has been multiplying its criticism of the eu , itself in a malaise after seeing its draft constitution rejected last week by two founding members , france and the netherlands . prime minister 's call for reform backfires berlusconi , under pressure and with little economic room to maneuver ahead of legislative elections next year , said last week that the eu needed to be reviewed , laws should be trimmed and red tape cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gianfranco fini his deputy , and the country 's foreign minister , gianfranco fini said tuesday that italy would be prepared to veto the controversial eu budget if its funds were reduced .
fini also warned of serious political divisions among the eu 's 25 leaders when they meet at their summit in brussels at the end of next week . two italian government ministers , both from the far-right northern league , have also sparked uproar by suggesting that italy refloat its old lira currency in parallel with the euro . the bloc agreed revisions to its budget pact in march , nearly 18 months after the rules were effectively suspended despite repeated violations of the 3.0 percent rule by eu heavyweights france and germany . portugal next in line for eu action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia the european union could also take disciplinary action against portugal this month for allowing its public deficit to exceed the eu guidelines , economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday . " we are going to release a similar report " to the one on italy made public on tuesday " on june 22 for portugal , " he told reporters at the european parliament in strasbourg . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief blasts weak eu budget rules when france and germany , chronic violators of eu budget requirements , pushed for a weakening of those rules , they hardly expected to attract imf attention .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .
12 , 1955 , which was also the 200th birthday of prussian general and military reformer , gerhard von scharnhorst , the first 101 volunteer soldiers were sworn in . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de students on target for the bundeswehr as germany 's defense ministry and its armed forces prepare to celebrate 50 years of existence , the german army - the bundeswehr - continues to raise its profile by giving students the opportunity to handle firearms .

german foreign minister joschka fischer will hold talks in washington on wednesday with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
transatlantic ties and germany 's bid for a un security coucil seat top the agenda . fischer left germany on monday and briefly stopped over in lisbon for talks with portuguese leaders on the crisis of the eu after french and dutch voters rejected the bloc 's new constitution in referendums last week . discussions in washington , scheduled to take place on tuesday and wednesday , will focus on transatlantic relations as well as on the situation in germany after chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants early elections in the fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer welcomed rice in berlin in 2004 that 's why fischer will have to dispel the impression that he is a lame duck foreign minister as his greens party is highly likely not to be in power come september .
as a result , fischer 's first visit to condoleezza rice in her capacity as united states secretary of state could well be his fare-well trip to washington . useless veto rights ? but there are a number of unresolved issues on the bilateral agenda - most notably the schröder government 's bid to win a permanent seat in the security council of a reformed united nations .
with german-american relations barely mended after a major fallout over the iraq war , the bush administration is reluctant to give support to the idea .
germany , japan , brazil and india have teamed up in a joint effort to become permanent council members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york in his talks with rice , fischer is expected to elaborate on a new german proposal that the country should be given privileged veto rights but combined with a german commitment not to exercise them .
germany is the third biggest financial contributor to the united nations and its un ambassador gunther pleuger is confident that the plan will find enough support in the world body . " our proposal has n't meet resistance so far , " he said .
" quite the contrary , there is increasing support for the idea in our discussions with all united nations ' members and in the political debates with major governments . " however , it 's still far from certain if fischer can win the support of the bush administration , which is said to favor the bids of japan and india .
and time is fast running out for schröder to achieve this key goal of his foreign policy agenda .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to present final recommendations for reform in september , only a few days before early elections in germany . do n't mention the nukes in an attempt to further improve transatlantic ties , joschka fischer will also refrain from touching the hot domestic issue of american nuclear weapons based in germany .
german regional leaders have urged fischer to press for the total withdrawal of such weapons which have remained in the country after the collapse of the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protesting against us nuclear warheads in europe earlier this year defense minister peter struck still vowed to make the nukes an issue during nato meetings .
but he has shied away from it after the united states secretly began repatriating most of their 150 nuclear missiles in germany .
at the moment 20 such weapons remain here . iran 's nuclear weapons program as well as support for iraqi reconstruction will also be on fischer 's agenda .
german assistance in training iraqi military and security personnel welcomed by washington and has contributed to a thaw in relations .
there was talk of a new chapter that should be opened in bilateral relations . with the prospect of a more bush-friendly conservative german government looming large on the horizon , this could happen faster than joschka fischer might have wished . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china against german un reform plans chinese-japanese relations and wartime past are affecting the proposed reforms of the united nations security council , possibly thwarting german attempts to secure a permanent seat on the council on its own terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu crisis has buffeted the euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution . the eu finance ministers , who have been at pains to ensure that the political fiasco after the french and dutch rejected the constitution does not take on an economic dimension as well , sought at their two-day meeting to show the eu at work rather than in turmoil . however , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who hosted the ministers meeting , acknowledged that the political crisis having an economic impact . " it 's true that at first sight the current state of europe does n't inspire confidence either amongst domestic consumers or foreign investors who are looking at us from afar and are finding it more and more difficult to understand , " he told journalists . but he insisted that the best way to restore confidence was to show business as usual in the run up to a june 16-17 summit of eu leaders in brussels , which will decide the fate of the beleaguered constitution . " i think that those who claim to be running europe , if you run europe you have to run it properly and use the next two weeks to show both to domestic consumers and those outside the european union that we are capable of making decisions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker he insisted the best way forward would be for member states to strike a deal on the 25-nation 's long term budget , which has so far torn deep divisions between them .
but although a brief discussion of the budget was officially on the agenda of tuesday 's meeting here , no breakthroughs were expected . british rebate juncker is meeting regularly with eu leaders in hope of brokering an agreement on the eu budget to be inked at the upcoming summit .
however , britain 's refusal to budge on its rebate from contributions to the eu budget has so far held up progress , which is likely to stall for some time if a deal is not struck before london takes over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency in july . despite the budget impasse , the ministers had a bevy of topics on the table - ranging from dutch finances to savings tax and development aid financing - to keep them busy and give the air of business as usual amid the signs of crisis . so far , the economic toll of the constitution fiasco has been directed on the euro , after two italian ministers suggested that italy would better off with out it .
last week italian social affairs minister roberto maroni - a member of the euroskeptic northern league - suggested italy should reintroduce the lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that assertion was backed monday by italian reform minister roberto calderoli - also a northern league member - who suggested rome could return to the lira , or even create a new currency pegged to the us dollar . defending the euro such comments have put euro-zone officials on the defensive with counter attacks insisting that the single european currency is one of the most successful projects of eu integration ever under taken . " it 's a huge success , we all must see the progress we made -lrb- with the euro -rrb- , the positive effects that we 're having in terms of as far as lower interest rates , as far as lower inflation , as far as the increase in growth is concerned , " austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser said . but some economists believe that the political crisis , which is unlikely to be solved quickly , will continue to weigh on the euro for some time . " political uncertainty , economic stagnation and growing skepticism about the potential for ecb -lrb- european central bank -rrb- rate hikes until next year are leading to broad-based euro weakness , and we find little to reverse that trend in the near future , " said bank of america analyst robert sinche , forecasting the euro will fall to 1.19 dollars by year-end . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .
-lrb- june 5 , 2005 -rrb- euro caught in constitution crossfire will it sink or will it float ?

siemens will buy 50 million euros worth of new shares in benq , giving it a 2.5 percent stake in the firm .
the takeover is expected to be completed by the end of september , the last quarter of siemens ' financial year .
the company will remain headquartered in munich .
" benq 's and siemens ' mobile phone businesses complement each excellently other in terms of technology and geography as well , " siemens said in a statement .
" this will give benq , which up until now has been very strong in asia , access to the european and latin american markets . "

the buyout with benq is expected to boost it to the fourth place in the worldwide market .
new focus at siemens the disposal accelerates siemens 's retreat from consumer electronics as the company focuses on industrial goods such as turbines , trains and automation equipment .
siemens follows other european manufacturers including alcatel and ericsson in giving up all or part of their businesses to asian competitors to expand distribution networks and lower production costs in addition to mobile phones , benq makes flat screens for computers , laptops , and cd-rom drives .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .

" i am delighted that the commission has been able to give the go-ahead to this project for a public-service television channel , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes . the commission said that , although the project involved state aid , " it could nevertheless be authorized as a project financing a service of general economic interest . " " the commission also concluded that the project offered sufficient guarantees against the risk of distortion of competition , for example by preventing unjustified transfers of public funds to france television and tf1 , who will be shareholders in the future channel , " it said . chirac unhappy at ' biased ' iraq reporting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac president jacques chirac championed the idea of the new network during the diplomatic spat with the united states in the run-up to the iraq war .
he was said to be unhappy with the way french policies were presented on international stations such as britain 's bbc world and the us-based cnn . jo gröbel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " gröbel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " president 's pet project realized but a french-language international television channel has been one of chirac 's pet projects for some time .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , the french president has championed the creation of such a channel for over three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then , in an interim report in 2003 , parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war from the western viewpoint with al-jazeera the main broadcaster in the arab world . the conclusion of that report was for the french to push for the channel that has now been approved .
the programs will mostly be in french , although english and other languages would also be used , and , though they would be beamed to several countries , they will not be seen in france itself - limiting the attraction for french advertisers . doubts over french-language audience " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo gröbel added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.06.2005 fischer heads to us to push un reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will this be fischer 's last trip to washington as foreign minister ?
german foreign minister joschka fischer will hold talks in washington on wednesday with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
transatlantic ties and germany 's bid for a un security coucil seat top the agenda . fischer left germany on monday and briefly stopped over in lisbon for talks with portuguese leaders on the crisis of the eu after french and dutch voters rejected the bloc 's new constitution in referendums last week . discussions in washington , scheduled to take place on tuesday and wednesday , will focus on transatlantic relations as well as on the situation in germany after chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants early elections in the fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer welcomed rice in berlin in 2004 that 's why fischer will have to dispel the impression that he is a lame duck foreign minister as his greens party is highly likely not to be in power come september .
as a result , fischer 's first visit to condoleezza rice in her capacity as united states secretary of state could well be his fare-well trip to washington . useless veto rights ? but there are a number of unresolved issues on the bilateral agenda - most notably the schröder government 's bid to win a permanent seat in the security council of a reformed united nations .
with german-american relations barely mended after a major fallout over the iraq war , the bush administration is reluctant to give support to the idea .
germany , japan , brazil and india have teamed up in a joint effort to become permanent council members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york in his talks with rice , fischer is expected to elaborate on a new german proposal that the country should be given privileged veto rights but combined with a german commitment not to exercise them .
germany is the third biggest financial contributor to the united nations and its un ambassador gunther pleuger is confident that the plan will find enough support in the world body . " our proposal has n't meet resistance so far , " he said .
" quite the contrary , there is increasing support for the idea in our discussions with all united nations ' members and in the political debates with major governments . " however , it 's still far from certain if fischer can win the support of the bush administration , which is said to favor the bids of japan and india .
and time is fast running out for schröder to achieve this key goal of his foreign policy agenda .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to present final recommendations for reform in september , only a few days before early elections in germany . do n't mention the nukes in an attempt to further improve transatlantic ties , joschka fischer will also refrain from touching the hot domestic issue of american nuclear weapons based in germany .
german regional leaders have urged fischer to press for the total withdrawal of such weapons which have remained in the country after the collapse of the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protesting against us nuclear warheads in europe earlier this year defense minister peter struck still vowed to make the nukes an issue during nato meetings .
but he has shied away from it after the united states secretly began repatriating most of their 150 nuclear missiles in germany .
at the moment 20 such weapons remain here . iran 's nuclear weapons program as well as support for iraqi reconstruction will also be on fischer 's agenda .
german assistance in training iraqi military and security personnel welcomed by washington and has contributed to a thaw in relations .
there was talk of a new chapter that should be opened in bilateral relations . with the prospect of a more bush-friendly conservative german government looming large on the horizon , this could happen faster than joschka fischer might have wished . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china against german un reform plans chinese-japanese relations and wartime past are affecting the proposed reforms of the united nations security council , possibly thwarting german attempts to secure a permanent seat on the council on its own terms .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops .

" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .
12 , 1955 , which was also the 200th birthday of prussian general and military reformer , gerhard von scharnhorst , the first 101 volunteer soldiers were sworn in . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de students on target for the bundeswehr as germany 's defense ministry and its armed forces prepare to celebrate 50 years of existence , the german army - the bundeswehr - continues to raise its profile by giving students the opportunity to handle firearms .

" it 's true that at first sight the current state of europe does n't inspire confidence either amongst domestic consumers or foreign investors who are looking at us from afar and are finding it more and more difficult to understand , " he told journalists . but he insisted that the best way to restore confidence was to show business as usual in the run up to a june 16-17 summit of eu leaders in brussels , which will decide the fate of the beleaguered constitution . " i think that those who claim to be running europe , if you run europe you have to run it properly and use the next two weeks to show both to domestic consumers and those outside the european union that we are capable of making decisions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker he insisted the best way forward would be for member states to strike a deal on the 25-nation 's long term budget , which has so far torn deep divisions between them .
but although a brief discussion of the budget was officially on the agenda of tuesday 's meeting here , no breakthroughs were expected . british rebate juncker is meeting regularly with eu leaders in hope of brokering an agreement on the eu budget to be inked at the upcoming summit .
however , britain 's refusal to budge on its rebate from contributions to the eu budget has so far held up progress , which is likely to stall for some time if a deal is not struck before london takes over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency in july . despite the budget impasse , the ministers had a bevy of topics on the table - ranging from dutch finances to savings tax and development aid financing - to keep them busy and give the air of business as usual amid the signs of crisis . so far , the economic toll of the constitution fiasco has been directed on the euro , after two italian ministers suggested that italy would better off with out it .

" it 's a huge success , we all must see the progress we made -lrb- with the euro -rrb- , the positive effects that we 're having in terms of as far as lower interest rates , as far as lower inflation , as far as the increase in growth is concerned , " austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser said . but some economists believe that the political crisis , which is unlikely to be solved quickly , will continue to weigh on the euro for some time . " political uncertainty , economic stagnation and growing skepticism about the potential for ecb -lrb- european central bank -rrb- rate hikes until next year are leading to broad-based euro weakness , and we find little to reverse that trend in the near future , " said bank of america analyst robert sinche , forecasting the euro will fall to 1.19 dollars by year-end . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .

" i am delighted that the commission has been able to give the go-ahead to this project for a public-service television channel , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes . the commission said that , although the project involved state aid , " it could nevertheless be authorized as a project financing a service of general economic interest . " " the commission also concluded that the project offered sufficient guarantees against the risk of distortion of competition , for example by preventing unjustified transfers of public funds to france television and tf1 , who will be shareholders in the future channel , " it said . chirac unhappy at ' biased ' iraq reporting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac president jacques chirac championed the idea of the new network during the diplomatic spat with the united states in the run-up to the iraq war .
he was said to be unhappy with the way french policies were presented on international stations such as britain 's bbc world and the us-based cnn . jo gröbel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " gröbel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " president 's pet project realized but a french-language international television channel has been one of chirac 's pet projects for some time .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , the french president has championed the creation of such a channel for over three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then , in an interim report in 2003 , parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war from the western viewpoint with al-jazeera the main broadcaster in the arab world . the conclusion of that report was for the french to push for the channel that has now been approved .
the programs will mostly be in french , although english and other languages would also be used , and , though they would be beamed to several countries , they will not be seen in france itself - limiting the attraction for french advertisers . doubts over french-language audience " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo gröbel added .
" undoubtedly there is enough interest for francophone news in french .
the question is who it would be aimed at who is not already reached by -lrb- swiss run -rrb- tv5 or radio france international . " in any case , though , such a channel would add to global news pluralism , gröbel said .
" from the political point of view , it makes sense for the french ' slash ' europeans to have a broader view , " he said .
" there is definitely room for a fourth global player . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cnn à la francaise france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .

officials also announced possible action against portugal . in a move that risked setting it on a collision course with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the eu 's executive arm noted that italy 's public deficit has exceeded the eu ceiling in both 2003 and 2004 . it said the excessive deficit , well beyond the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , could not be blamed on exceptional circumstances . " the excess of the deficit over the reference value is not exceptional , as defined by the pact ... nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn , " conditions which may have won rome a reprieve , the commission said in a report . euro zone 's biggest public deficit italy is currently in a mild recession and its public deficit is the largest in the 12-nation euro zone .
the italian government has acknowledged that it will exceed the eu 's ceiling again this year . the commission said italy 's deficit " has been above the reference value for two years and , according to the commission 's spring forecast , it will be well above 3.0 percent in 2005 and 2006 , even if economic growth returned to its potential rate . " " recent government announcements reinforce this projection , " it said . the commission 's excessive deficit action and recommendations will be examined by eu finance ministers at their next meeting on july 11 and 12 . finance minister calls for reason bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian finance minister domenico siniscalco , right , shares a word with fellow pact breaker german finance minister hans eichel left .
greek finance minister george alogoskoufis looks on .
in luxembourg , italian finance minister domenico siniscalco -lrb- photo , left -rrb- immediately issued a call for reason and said he hoped that his eu partners would give rome at least two years , until 2007 , to bring the deficit back into line .
" i am fighting for a reasonable solution , " he said .
" this is not an examination but an attempt between partners to find a solution that is in everybody 's interest . " the move came as the italian government has been multiplying its criticism of the eu , itself in a malaise after seeing its draft constitution rejected last week by two founding members , france and the netherlands . prime minister 's call for reform backfires berlusconi , under pressure and with little economic room to maneuver ahead of legislative elections next year , said last week that the eu needed to be reviewed , laws should be trimmed and red tape cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gianfranco fini his deputy , and the country 's foreign minister , gianfranco fini said tuesday that italy would be prepared to veto the controversial eu budget if its funds were reduced .
fini also warned of serious political divisions among the eu 's 25 leaders when they meet at their summit in brussels at the end of next week . two italian government ministers , both from the far-right northern league , have also sparked uproar by suggesting that italy refloat its old lira currency in parallel with the euro . the bloc agreed revisions to its budget pact in march , nearly 18 months after the rules were effectively suspended despite repeated violations of the 3.0 percent rule by eu heavyweights france and germany . portugal next in line for eu action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia the european union could also take disciplinary action against portugal this month for allowing its public deficit to exceed the eu guidelines , economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday . " we are going to release a similar report " to the one on italy made public on tuesday " on june 22 for portugal , " he told reporters at the european parliament in strasbourg . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief blasts weak eu budget rules when france and germany , chronic violators of eu budget requirements , pushed for a weakening of those rules , they hardly expected to attract imf attention .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .
12 , 1955 , which was also the 200th birthday of prussian general and military reformer , gerhard von scharnhorst , the first 101 volunteer soldiers were sworn in . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de students on target for the bundeswehr as germany 's defense ministry and its armed forces prepare to celebrate 50 years of existence , the german army - the bundeswehr - continues to raise its profile by giving students the opportunity to handle firearms .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .
the people in brussels will have to respect that .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .
12 , 1955 , which was also the 200th birthday of prussian general and military reformer , gerhard von scharnhorst , the first 101 volunteer soldiers were sworn in . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de students on target for the bundeswehr as germany 's defense ministry and its armed forces prepare to celebrate 50 years of existence , the german army - the bundeswehr - continues to raise its profile by giving students the opportunity to handle firearms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 blair gets african aid pledge from bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is confident bush will open the white house coffers for africa us president george bush was to pledge $ 674 million in new aid for africa at a summit on tuesday with british leader tony blair .
but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

siemens will book pretax costs of 350 million euros on the sale .
full financial details were not disclosed , but the deal essentially means siemens is paying benq to take the business , which is losing 1.5 million euros a day .
workers will stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq ceo k.y. lee showing off a cell phone at a meeting in bombay under terms of the deal , benq can use the siemens brand name for five years .
the taiwanese company will take over the 6,000 people employed in the business " under existing contractual conditions , " siemens said .
siemens will buy 50 million euros worth of new shares in benq , giving it a 2.5 percent stake in the firm .
the takeover is expected to be completed by the end of september , the last quarter of siemens ' financial year .
the company will remain headquartered in munich .
" benq 's and siemens ' mobile phone businesses complement each excellently other in terms of technology and geography as well , " siemens said in a statement .
" this will give benq , which up until now has been very strong in asia , access to the european and latin american markets . "
falling market share for months now , siemens has been actively seeking a partner for its cellular business , which has booked hundreds of millions in losses over the past year .
siemens had been trying until the last minute to sell the business to motorola , but the us firm finally pulled out of talks , newspaper reports said .

in the first quarter , the brand was in fifth place in the world cell phone market ; by the time of the sale it had slipped to seventh place .
the buyout with benq is expected to boost it to the fourth place in the worldwide market .
new focus at siemens the disposal accelerates siemens 's retreat from consumer electronics as the company focuses on industrial goods such as turbines , trains and automation equipment .
siemens follows other european manufacturers including alcatel and ericsson in giving up all or part of their businesses to asian competitors to expand distribution networks and lower production costs in addition to mobile phones , benq makes flat screens for computers , laptops , and cd-rom drives .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .
the people in brussels will have to respect that .

the taiwanese company will take over the 6,000 people employed in the business " under existing contractual conditions , " siemens said .
siemens will buy 50 million euros worth of new shares in benq , giving it a 2.5 percent stake in the firm .
the takeover is expected to be completed by the end of september , the last quarter of siemens ' financial year .
the company will remain headquartered in munich .
" benq 's and siemens ' mobile phone businesses complement each excellently other in terms of technology and geography as well , " siemens said in a statement .
" this will give benq , which up until now has been very strong in asia , access to the european and latin american markets . "
falling market share for months now , siemens has been actively seeking a partner for its cellular business , which has booked hundreds of millions in losses over the past year .

the buyout with benq is expected to boost it to the fourth place in the worldwide market .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .

officials also announced possible action against portugal . in a move that risked setting it on a collision course with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the eu 's executive arm noted that italy 's public deficit has exceeded the eu ceiling in both 2003 and 2004 . it said the excessive deficit , well beyond the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , could not be blamed on exceptional circumstances . " the excess of the deficit over the reference value is not exceptional , as defined by the pact ... nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn , " conditions which may have won rome a reprieve , the commission said in a report . euro zone 's biggest public deficit italy is currently in a mild recession and its public deficit is the largest in the 12-nation euro zone .
the italian government has acknowledged that it will exceed the eu 's ceiling again this year . the commission said italy 's deficit " has been above the reference value for two years and , according to the commission 's spring forecast , it will be well above 3.0 percent in 2005 and 2006 , even if economic growth returned to its potential rate . " " recent government announcements reinforce this projection , " it said . the commission 's excessive deficit action and recommendations will be examined by eu finance ministers at their next meeting on july 11 and 12 . finance minister calls for reason bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian finance minister domenico siniscalco , right , shares a word with fellow pact breaker german finance minister hans eichel left .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .
12 , 1955 , which was also the 200th birthday of prussian general and military reformer , gerhard von scharnhorst , the first 101 volunteer soldiers were sworn in . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de students on target for the bundeswehr as germany 's defense ministry and its armed forces prepare to celebrate 50 years of existence , the german army - the bundeswehr - continues to raise its profile by giving students the opportunity to handle firearms .

officials also announced possible action against portugal . in a move that risked setting it on a collision course with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the eu 's executive arm noted that italy 's public deficit has exceeded the eu ceiling in both 2003 and 2004 . it said the excessive deficit , well beyond the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , could not be blamed on exceptional circumstances . " the excess of the deficit over the reference value is not exceptional , as defined by the pact ... nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn , " conditions which may have won rome a reprieve , the commission said in a report . euro zone 's biggest public deficit italy is currently in a mild recession and its public deficit is the largest in the 12-nation euro zone .
the italian government has acknowledged that it will exceed the eu 's ceiling again this year . the commission said italy 's deficit " has been above the reference value for two years and , according to the commission 's spring forecast , it will be well above 3.0 percent in 2005 and 2006 , even if economic growth returned to its potential rate . " " recent government announcements reinforce this projection , " it said . the commission 's excessive deficit action and recommendations will be examined by eu finance ministers at their next meeting on july 11 and 12 . finance minister calls for reason bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian finance minister domenico siniscalco , right , shares a word with fellow pact breaker german finance minister hans eichel left .
greek finance minister george alogoskoufis looks on .
in luxembourg , italian finance minister domenico siniscalco -lrb- photo , left -rrb- immediately issued a call for reason and said he hoped that his eu partners would give rome at least two years , until 2007 , to bring the deficit back into line .
" i am fighting for a reasonable solution , " he said .
" this is not an examination but an attempt between partners to find a solution that is in everybody 's interest . " the move came as the italian government has been multiplying its criticism of the eu , itself in a malaise after seeing its draft constitution rejected last week by two founding members , france and the netherlands . prime minister 's call for reform backfires berlusconi , under pressure and with little economic room to maneuver ahead of legislative elections next year , said last week that the eu needed to be reviewed , laws should be trimmed and red tape cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gianfranco fini his deputy , and the country 's foreign minister , gianfranco fini said tuesday that italy would be prepared to veto the controversial eu budget if its funds were reduced .
fini also warned of serious political divisions among the eu 's 25 leaders when they meet at their summit in brussels at the end of next week . two italian government ministers , both from the far-right northern league , have also sparked uproar by suggesting that italy refloat its old lira currency in parallel with the euro . the bloc agreed revisions to its budget pact in march , nearly 18 months after the rules were effectively suspended despite repeated violations of the 3.0 percent rule by eu heavyweights france and germany . portugal next in line for eu action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia the european union could also take disciplinary action against portugal this month for allowing its public deficit to exceed the eu guidelines , economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .
the people in brussels will have to respect that .

what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .

at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .

britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "

what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .

but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .
the people in brussels will have to respect that .

siemens will book pretax costs of 350 million euros on the sale .
full financial details were not disclosed , but the deal essentially means siemens is paying benq to take the business , which is losing 1.5 million euros a day .
workers will stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq ceo k.y. lee showing off a cell phone at a meeting in bombay under terms of the deal , benq can use the siemens brand name for five years .
the taiwanese company will take over the 6,000 people employed in the business " under existing contractual conditions , " siemens said .
siemens will buy 50 million euros worth of new shares in benq , giving it a 2.5 percent stake in the firm .
the takeover is expected to be completed by the end of september , the last quarter of siemens ' financial year .
the company will remain headquartered in munich .
" benq 's and siemens ' mobile phone businesses complement each excellently other in terms of technology and geography as well , " siemens said in a statement .
" this will give benq , which up until now has been very strong in asia , access to the european and latin american markets . "
falling market share for months now , siemens has been actively seeking a partner for its cellular business , which has booked hundreds of millions in losses over the past year .
siemens had been trying until the last minute to sell the business to motorola , but the us firm finally pulled out of talks , newspaper reports said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens m65 cell phone siemens saw a severe decrease in market share over the past year due to price wars in the cell phone market and internal problems such as a serious software breakdown in its new models .
in the first quarter , the brand was in fifth place in the world cell phone market ; by the time of the sale it had slipped to seventh place .
the buyout with benq is expected to boost it to the fourth place in the worldwide market .
new focus at siemens the disposal accelerates siemens 's retreat from consumer electronics as the company focuses on industrial goods such as turbines , trains and automation equipment .
siemens follows other european manufacturers including alcatel and ericsson in giving up all or part of their businesses to asian competitors to expand distribution networks and lower production costs in addition to mobile phones , benq makes flat screens for computers , laptops , and cd-rom drives .
in terms of mobile phones , just a third of benq 's production is under its own name ; it produces the others for manufacturers like market-leader nokia . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens calling for help german technology giant siemens wednesday announced a tumble in profits for its second quarter and said it was looking for a partner for its beleaguered mobile phone unit .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops .

" long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .
the people in brussels will have to respect that .

officials also announced possible action against portugal . in a move that risked setting it on a collision course with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the eu 's executive arm noted that italy 's public deficit has exceeded the eu ceiling in both 2003 and 2004 . it said the excessive deficit , well beyond the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , could not be blamed on exceptional circumstances . " the excess of the deficit over the reference value is not exceptional , as defined by the pact ... nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn , " conditions which may have won rome a reprieve , the commission said in a report . euro zone 's biggest public deficit italy is currently in a mild recession and its public deficit is the largest in the 12-nation euro zone .
the italian government has acknowledged that it will exceed the eu 's ceiling again this year . the commission said italy 's deficit " has been above the reference value for two years and , according to the commission 's spring forecast , it will be well above 3.0 percent in 2005 and 2006 , even if economic growth returned to its potential rate . " " recent government announcements reinforce this projection , " it said . the commission 's excessive deficit action and recommendations will be examined by eu finance ministers at their next meeting on july 11 and 12 . finance minister calls for reason bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian finance minister domenico siniscalco , right , shares a word with fellow pact breaker german finance minister hans eichel left .

" i am fighting for a reasonable solution , " he said .
" this is not an examination but an attempt between partners to find a solution that is in everybody 's interest . " the move came as the italian government has been multiplying its criticism of the eu , itself in a malaise after seeing its draft constitution rejected last week by two founding members , france and the netherlands . prime minister 's call for reform backfires berlusconi , under pressure and with little economic room to maneuver ahead of legislative elections next year , said last week that the eu needed to be reviewed , laws should be trimmed and red tape cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gianfranco fini his deputy , and the country 's foreign minister , gianfranco fini said tuesday that italy would be prepared to veto the controversial eu budget if its funds were reduced .
fini also warned of serious political divisions among the eu 's 25 leaders when they meet at their summit in brussels at the end of next week . two italian government ministers , both from the far-right northern league , have also sparked uproar by suggesting that italy refloat its old lira currency in parallel with the euro . the bloc agreed revisions to its budget pact in march , nearly 18 months after the rules were effectively suspended despite repeated violations of the 3.0 percent rule by eu heavyweights france and germany . portugal next in line for eu action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia the european union could also take disciplinary action against portugal this month for allowing its public deficit to exceed the eu guidelines , economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu crisis has buffeted the euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution . the eu finance ministers , who have been at pains to ensure that the political fiasco after the french and dutch rejected the constitution does not take on an economic dimension as well , sought at their two-day meeting to show the eu at work rather than in turmoil . however , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who hosted the ministers meeting , acknowledged that the political crisis having an economic impact . " it 's true that at first sight the current state of europe does n't inspire confidence either amongst domestic consumers or foreign investors who are looking at us from afar and are finding it more and more difficult to understand , " he told journalists . but he insisted that the best way to restore confidence was to show business as usual in the run up to a june 16-17 summit of eu leaders in brussels , which will decide the fate of the beleaguered constitution . " i think that those who claim to be running europe , if you run europe you have to run it properly and use the next two weeks to show both to domestic consumers and those outside the european union that we are capable of making decisions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker he insisted the best way forward would be for member states to strike a deal on the 25-nation 's long term budget , which has so far torn deep divisions between them .
but although a brief discussion of the budget was officially on the agenda of tuesday 's meeting here , no breakthroughs were expected . british rebate juncker is meeting regularly with eu leaders in hope of brokering an agreement on the eu budget to be inked at the upcoming summit .
however , britain 's refusal to budge on its rebate from contributions to the eu budget has so far held up progress , which is likely to stall for some time if a deal is not struck before london takes over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency in july . despite the budget impasse , the ministers had a bevy of topics on the table - ranging from dutch finances to savings tax and development aid financing - to keep them busy and give the air of business as usual amid the signs of crisis . so far , the economic toll of the constitution fiasco has been directed on the euro , after two italian ministers suggested that italy would better off with out it .
last week italian social affairs minister roberto maroni - a member of the euroskeptic northern league - suggested italy should reintroduce the lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that assertion was backed monday by italian reform minister roberto calderoli - also a northern league member - who suggested rome could return to the lira , or even create a new currency pegged to the us dollar . defending the euro such comments have put euro-zone officials on the defensive with counter attacks insisting that the single european currency is one of the most successful projects of eu integration ever under taken . " it 's a huge success , we all must see the progress we made -lrb- with the euro -rrb- , the positive effects that we 're having in terms of as far as lower interest rates , as far as lower inflation , as far as the increase in growth is concerned , " austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser said . but some economists believe that the political crisis , which is unlikely to be solved quickly , will continue to weigh on the euro for some time . " political uncertainty , economic stagnation and growing skepticism about the potential for ecb -lrb- european central bank -rrb- rate hikes until next year are leading to broad-based euro weakness , and we find little to reverse that trend in the near future , " said bank of america analyst robert sinche , forecasting the euro will fall to 1.19 dollars by year-end . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .
-lrb- june 5 , 2005 -rrb- euro caught in constitution crossfire will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- expected french ' non ' hits euro the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy .

officials also announced possible action against portugal . in a move that risked setting it on a collision course with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the eu 's executive arm noted that italy 's public deficit has exceeded the eu ceiling in both 2003 and 2004 . it said the excessive deficit , well beyond the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , could not be blamed on exceptional circumstances . " the excess of the deficit over the reference value is not exceptional , as defined by the pact ... nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn , " conditions which may have won rome a reprieve , the commission said in a report . euro zone 's biggest public deficit italy is currently in a mild recession and its public deficit is the largest in the 12-nation euro zone .
the italian government has acknowledged that it will exceed the eu 's ceiling again this year . the commission said italy 's deficit " has been above the reference value for two years and , according to the commission 's spring forecast , it will be well above 3.0 percent in 2005 and 2006 , even if economic growth returned to its potential rate . " " recent government announcements reinforce this projection , " it said . the commission 's excessive deficit action and recommendations will be examined by eu finance ministers at their next meeting on july 11 and 12 . finance minister calls for reason bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian finance minister domenico siniscalco , right , shares a word with fellow pact breaker german finance minister hans eichel left .
greek finance minister george alogoskoufis looks on .
in luxembourg , italian finance minister domenico siniscalco -lrb- photo , left -rrb- immediately issued a call for reason and said he hoped that his eu partners would give rome at least two years , until 2007 , to bring the deficit back into line .
" i am fighting for a reasonable solution , " he said .
" this is not an examination but an attempt between partners to find a solution that is in everybody 's interest . " the move came as the italian government has been multiplying its criticism of the eu , itself in a malaise after seeing its draft constitution rejected last week by two founding members , france and the netherlands . prime minister 's call for reform backfires berlusconi , under pressure and with little economic room to maneuver ahead of legislative elections next year , said last week that the eu needed to be reviewed , laws should be trimmed and red tape cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gianfranco fini his deputy , and the country 's foreign minister , gianfranco fini said tuesday that italy would be prepared to veto the controversial eu budget if its funds were reduced .
fini also warned of serious political divisions among the eu 's 25 leaders when they meet at their summit in brussels at the end of next week . two italian government ministers , both from the far-right northern league , have also sparked uproar by suggesting that italy refloat its old lira currency in parallel with the euro . the bloc agreed revisions to its budget pact in march , nearly 18 months after the rules were effectively suspended despite repeated violations of the 3.0 percent rule by eu heavyweights france and germany . portugal next in line for eu action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia the european union could also take disciplinary action against portugal this month for allowing its public deficit to exceed the eu guidelines , economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .

german foreign minister joschka fischer will hold talks in washington on wednesday with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
transatlantic ties and germany 's bid for a un security coucil seat top the agenda . fischer left germany on monday and briefly stopped over in lisbon for talks with portuguese leaders on the crisis of the eu after french and dutch voters rejected the bloc 's new constitution in referendums last week . discussions in washington , scheduled to take place on tuesday and wednesday , will focus on transatlantic relations as well as on the situation in germany after chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants early elections in the fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer welcomed rice in berlin in 2004 that 's why fischer will have to dispel the impression that he is a lame duck foreign minister as his greens party is highly likely not to be in power come september .
as a result , fischer 's first visit to condoleezza rice in her capacity as united states secretary of state could well be his fare-well trip to washington . useless veto rights ? but there are a number of unresolved issues on the bilateral agenda - most notably the schröder government 's bid to win a permanent seat in the security council of a reformed united nations .
with german-american relations barely mended after a major fallout over the iraq war , the bush administration is reluctant to give support to the idea .
germany , japan , brazil and india have teamed up in a joint effort to become permanent council members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york in his talks with rice , fischer is expected to elaborate on a new german proposal that the country should be given privileged veto rights but combined with a german commitment not to exercise them .
germany is the third biggest financial contributor to the united nations and its un ambassador gunther pleuger is confident that the plan will find enough support in the world body . " our proposal has n't meet resistance so far , " he said .
" quite the contrary , there is increasing support for the idea in our discussions with all united nations ' members and in the political debates with major governments . " however , it 's still far from certain if fischer can win the support of the bush administration , which is said to favor the bids of japan and india .
and time is fast running out for schröder to achieve this key goal of his foreign policy agenda .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to present final recommendations for reform in september , only a few days before early elections in germany . do n't mention the nukes in an attempt to further improve transatlantic ties , joschka fischer will also refrain from touching the hot domestic issue of american nuclear weapons based in germany .
german regional leaders have urged fischer to press for the total withdrawal of such weapons which have remained in the country after the collapse of the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protesting against us nuclear warheads in europe earlier this year defense minister peter struck still vowed to make the nukes an issue during nato meetings .
but he has shied away from it after the united states secretly began repatriating most of their 150 nuclear missiles in germany .
at the moment 20 such weapons remain here . iran 's nuclear weapons program as well as support for iraqi reconstruction will also be on fischer 's agenda .
german assistance in training iraqi military and security personnel welcomed by washington and has contributed to a thaw in relations .
there was talk of a new chapter that should be opened in bilateral relations . with the prospect of a more bush-friendly conservative german government looming large on the horizon , this could happen faster than joschka fischer might have wished . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china against german un reform plans chinese-japanese relations and wartime past are affecting the proposed reforms of the united nations security council , possibly thwarting german attempts to secure a permanent seat on the council on its own terms .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .
the people in brussels will have to respect that .

" i am delighted that the commission has been able to give the go-ahead to this project for a public-service television channel , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes . the commission said that , although the project involved state aid , " it could nevertheless be authorized as a project financing a service of general economic interest . " " the commission also concluded that the project offered sufficient guarantees against the risk of distortion of competition , for example by preventing unjustified transfers of public funds to france television and tf1 , who will be shareholders in the future channel , " it said . chirac unhappy at ' biased ' iraq reporting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac president jacques chirac championed the idea of the new network during the diplomatic spat with the united states in the run-up to the iraq war .
he was said to be unhappy with the way french policies were presented on international stations such as britain 's bbc world and the us-based cnn . jo gröbel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " gröbel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " president 's pet project realized but a french-language international television channel has been one of chirac 's pet projects for some time .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , the french president has championed the creation of such a channel for over three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then , in an interim report in 2003 , parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war from the western viewpoint with al-jazeera the main broadcaster in the arab world . the conclusion of that report was for the french to push for the channel that has now been approved .
the programs will mostly be in french , although english and other languages would also be used , and , though they would be beamed to several countries , they will not be seen in france itself - limiting the attraction for french advertisers . doubts over french-language audience " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo gröbel added .
" undoubtedly there is enough interest for francophone news in french .
the question is who it would be aimed at who is not already reached by -lrb- swiss run -rrb- tv5 or radio france international . " in any case , though , such a channel would add to global news pluralism , gröbel said .
" from the political point of view , it makes sense for the french ' slash ' europeans to have a broader view , " he said .
" there is definitely room for a fourth global player . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cnn à la francaise france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .

officials also announced possible action against portugal . in a move that risked setting it on a collision course with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the eu 's executive arm noted that italy 's public deficit has exceeded the eu ceiling in both 2003 and 2004 . it said the excessive deficit , well beyond the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , could not be blamed on exceptional circumstances . " the excess of the deficit over the reference value is not exceptional , as defined by the pact ... nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn , " conditions which may have won rome a reprieve , the commission said in a report . euro zone 's biggest public deficit italy is currently in a mild recession and its public deficit is the largest in the 12-nation euro zone .
the italian government has acknowledged that it will exceed the eu 's ceiling again this year . the commission said italy 's deficit " has been above the reference value for two years and , according to the commission 's spring forecast , it will be well above 3.0 percent in 2005 and 2006 , even if economic growth returned to its potential rate . " " recent government announcements reinforce this projection , " it said . the commission 's excessive deficit action and recommendations will be examined by eu finance ministers at their next meeting on july 11 and 12 . finance minister calls for reason bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian finance minister domenico siniscalco , right , shares a word with fellow pact breaker german finance minister hans eichel left .

in luxembourg , italian finance minister domenico siniscalco -lrb- photo , left -rrb- immediately issued a call for reason and said he hoped that his eu partners would give rome at least two years , until 2007 , to bring the deficit back into line .
" i am fighting for a reasonable solution , " he said .
" this is not an examination but an attempt between partners to find a solution that is in everybody 's interest . " the move came as the italian government has been multiplying its criticism of the eu , itself in a malaise after seeing its draft constitution rejected last week by two founding members , france and the netherlands . prime minister 's call for reform backfires berlusconi , under pressure and with little economic room to maneuver ahead of legislative elections next year , said last week that the eu needed to be reviewed , laws should be trimmed and red tape cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gianfranco fini his deputy , and the country 's foreign minister , gianfranco fini said tuesday that italy would be prepared to veto the controversial eu budget if its funds were reduced .
fini also warned of serious political divisions among the eu 's 25 leaders when they meet at their summit in brussels at the end of next week . two italian government ministers , both from the far-right northern league , have also sparked uproar by suggesting that italy refloat its old lira currency in parallel with the euro . the bloc agreed revisions to its budget pact in march , nearly 18 months after the rules were effectively suspended despite repeated violations of the 3.0 percent rule by eu heavyweights france and germany . portugal next in line for eu action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia the european union could also take disciplinary action against portugal this month for allowing its public deficit to exceed the eu guidelines , economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .

" it 's true that at first sight the current state of europe does n't inspire confidence either amongst domestic consumers or foreign investors who are looking at us from afar and are finding it more and more difficult to understand , " he told journalists . but he insisted that the best way to restore confidence was to show business as usual in the run up to a june 16-17 summit of eu leaders in brussels , which will decide the fate of the beleaguered constitution . " i think that those who claim to be running europe , if you run europe you have to run it properly and use the next two weeks to show both to domestic consumers and those outside the european union that we are capable of making decisions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker he insisted the best way forward would be for member states to strike a deal on the 25-nation 's long term budget , which has so far torn deep divisions between them .
but although a brief discussion of the budget was officially on the agenda of tuesday 's meeting here , no breakthroughs were expected . british rebate juncker is meeting regularly with eu leaders in hope of brokering an agreement on the eu budget to be inked at the upcoming summit .
however , britain 's refusal to budge on its rebate from contributions to the eu budget has so far held up progress , which is likely to stall for some time if a deal is not struck before london takes over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency in july . despite the budget impasse , the ministers had a bevy of topics on the table - ranging from dutch finances to savings tax and development aid financing - to keep them busy and give the air of business as usual amid the signs of crisis . so far , the economic toll of the constitution fiasco has been directed on the euro , after two italian ministers suggested that italy would better off with out it .
last week italian social affairs minister roberto maroni - a member of the euroskeptic northern league - suggested italy should reintroduce the lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that assertion was backed monday by italian reform minister roberto calderoli - also a northern league member - who suggested rome could return to the lira , or even create a new currency pegged to the us dollar . defending the euro such comments have put euro-zone officials on the defensive with counter attacks insisting that the single european currency is one of the most successful projects of eu integration ever under taken . " it 's a huge success , we all must see the progress we made -lrb- with the euro -rrb- , the positive effects that we 're having in terms of as far as lower interest rates , as far as lower inflation , as far as the increase in growth is concerned , " austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser said . but some economists believe that the political crisis , which is unlikely to be solved quickly , will continue to weigh on the euro for some time . " political uncertainty , economic stagnation and growing skepticism about the potential for ecb -lrb- european central bank -rrb- rate hikes until next year are leading to broad-based euro weakness , and we find little to reverse that trend in the near future , " said bank of america analyst robert sinche , forecasting the euro will fall to 1.19 dollars by year-end . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 eu backs french cnn rival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cnn 's iraq coverage convinced france to pursue its own channel the european commission gave its green light tuesday to plans for a french international television news network to rival the bbc and cnn , saying the project does not breach eu state aid rules . the french international news channel -lrb- cfii -rrb- is a joint operation between state broadcaster france television and the private channel tf1 , with the government providing 30 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- to get it started . " i am delighted that the commission has been able to give the go-ahead to this project for a public-service television channel , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes . the commission said that , although the project involved state aid , " it could nevertheless be authorized as a project financing a service of general economic interest . " " the commission also concluded that the project offered sufficient guarantees against the risk of distortion of competition , for example by preventing unjustified transfers of public funds to france television and tf1 , who will be shareholders in the future channel , " it said . chirac unhappy at ' biased ' iraq reporting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac president jacques chirac championed the idea of the new network during the diplomatic spat with the united states in the run-up to the iraq war .
he was said to be unhappy with the way french policies were presented on international stations such as britain 's bbc world and the us-based cnn . jo gröbel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " gröbel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " president 's pet project realized but a french-language international television channel has been one of chirac 's pet projects for some time .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , the french president has championed the creation of such a channel for over three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then , in an interim report in 2003 , parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war from the western viewpoint with al-jazeera the main broadcaster in the arab world . the conclusion of that report was for the french to push for the channel that has now been approved .
the programs will mostly be in french , although english and other languages would also be used , and , though they would be beamed to several countries , they will not be seen in france itself - limiting the attraction for french advertisers . doubts over french-language audience " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo gröbel added .
" undoubtedly there is enough interest for francophone news in french .
the question is who it would be aimed at who is not already reached by -lrb- swiss run -rrb- tv5 or radio france international . " in any case , though , such a channel would add to global news pluralism , gröbel said .
" from the political point of view , it makes sense for the french ' slash ' europeans to have a broader view , " he said .
" there is definitely room for a fourth global player . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cnn à la francaise france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .
it is meant to compete with cnn and bbc world but will broadcast in french .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops .

" long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch cows wear protest signs against the referendum on the eu constitution in oosthuizen , 32 km north of amsterdam , wednesday , may 25 , 2005 .
the dutch word " boe " refers to the sound cows make and , like the english " boo , " signals disapproval .
" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .

the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen .

but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

german foreign minister joschka fischer will hold talks in washington on wednesday with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
transatlantic ties and germany 's bid for a un security coucil seat top the agenda . fischer left germany on monday and briefly stopped over in lisbon for talks with portuguese leaders on the crisis of the eu after french and dutch voters rejected the bloc 's new constitution in referendums last week . discussions in washington , scheduled to take place on tuesday and wednesday , will focus on transatlantic relations as well as on the situation in germany after chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants early elections in the fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer welcomed rice in berlin in 2004 that 's why fischer will have to dispel the impression that he is a lame duck foreign minister as his greens party is highly likely not to be in power come september .
as a result , fischer 's first visit to condoleezza rice in her capacity as united states secretary of state could well be his fare-well trip to washington . useless veto rights ? but there are a number of unresolved issues on the bilateral agenda - most notably the schröder government 's bid to win a permanent seat in the security council of a reformed united nations .

germany is the third biggest financial contributor to the united nations and its un ambassador gunther pleuger is confident that the plan will find enough support in the world body . " our proposal has n't meet resistance so far , " he said .
" quite the contrary , there is increasing support for the idea in our discussions with all united nations ' members and in the political debates with major governments . " however , it 's still far from certain if fischer can win the support of the bush administration , which is said to favor the bids of japan and india .

but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu crisis has buffeted the euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution . the eu finance ministers , who have been at pains to ensure that the political fiasco after the french and dutch rejected the constitution does not take on an economic dimension as well , sought at their two-day meeting to show the eu at work rather than in turmoil . however , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who hosted the ministers meeting , acknowledged that the political crisis having an economic impact . " it 's true that at first sight the current state of europe does n't inspire confidence either amongst domestic consumers or foreign investors who are looking at us from afar and are finding it more and more difficult to understand , " he told journalists . but he insisted that the best way to restore confidence was to show business as usual in the run up to a june 16-17 summit of eu leaders in brussels , which will decide the fate of the beleaguered constitution . " i think that those who claim to be running europe , if you run europe you have to run it properly and use the next two weeks to show both to domestic consumers and those outside the european union that we are capable of making decisions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker he insisted the best way forward would be for member states to strike a deal on the 25-nation 's long term budget , which has so far torn deep divisions between them .
but although a brief discussion of the budget was officially on the agenda of tuesday 's meeting here , no breakthroughs were expected . british rebate juncker is meeting regularly with eu leaders in hope of brokering an agreement on the eu budget to be inked at the upcoming summit .
however , britain 's refusal to budge on its rebate from contributions to the eu budget has so far held up progress , which is likely to stall for some time if a deal is not struck before london takes over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency in july . despite the budget impasse , the ministers had a bevy of topics on the table - ranging from dutch finances to savings tax and development aid financing - to keep them busy and give the air of business as usual amid the signs of crisis . so far , the economic toll of the constitution fiasco has been directed on the euro , after two italian ministers suggested that italy would better off with out it .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction . last week 's ballots in both france and the netherlands , in which majorities rejected the eu constitution , were a blow to the eu elites , just as many voters intended them to be .
the charter , hammered out in tortuous fashion over several years , went down to defeat in two of the eu 's founding countries : 55 percent of the french said " non " ; 61.1 percent of the dutch screamed " nee . "
for many voters , the referendums were a way to express the widely held view that the eu is an imperious bureaucracy that is unresponsive to the concerns of everyday people .
" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .
he voted against the constitution to send a message to those in charge that he does exist and wants a say in how the european union moves forward .
" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .
" they have shown those in brussels , who seem to think everything about european integration is going fine , that out there among the population there is a real difference of opinion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .
" referendums can improve european democracy , " he said , adding that that was highly unlikely , if europeans actually vote against the eu project in the end , " well , that 's democracy too .

" no one seems to be in charge and no one seems to be listening to us , " iwan amier , a 41-year-old limousine driver in the netherlands , told reuters .

" these referendums have been an earthquake for the european elite , " said carsten berg of the brussels-based initiative and referendum institute europe .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks past campaign posters in reference to the referendum on the eu constitution in a street of aix-en-provence , southern france , thursday , may 26 , 2005 .
the referendums in france and the netherlands stirred a charged debate over the eu that has not been heard in years , if ever .
generally , mention the european union and responses from average citizens range from a blank stare to a loud yawn .
but particularly in france , the two months of campaigning triggered a passionate political debate about the bloc , with both sides sensing that the referendum was a moment to define france 's future .
the right tool ?
but that is precisely one of the reasons some wonder if an issue as complicated and technical as the eu constitution , which ran into the hundreds of pages and was impenetrable to all but the most advanced of technocrats , is best settled with a popular referendum that could easily be sidetracked .
in france , many said their ballots were based just as much on national issues as they were on the actual contents of the constitution , which remained murky at best for many voters .
" i 'm not sure if referendums were the best way to do this , " said marco incerti , a spokesman for the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" if you look at the arguments that were used in the campaign , many had very little to do with the constitution itself .
citizens saw it as one more chance to protest against the government . "
he added that campaigners opposed to the constitution were able to rely on a widespread lack of understanding about the charter to sway people to the " no " camp with specious arguments , while some national politicians used the same tactics to gain political points at home .
bildunterschrift : " it 's a good thing if the voters in the eu states exercise their right to decide , " he said .
" what is not so encouraging , is the fact that some people were voting on the basis of false information .
we need a lot more education in the eu , a lot more information going out to the voter if the referendum issue is going to work the way it should . "
onward , ratification process ?
what is still unclear is whether the constitution 's ratification process will continue .
most agree that the charter in its current form has little , if any , chance for survival .
at the upcoming regular summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16 and 17 , eu leaders may decide to scrap all the other planned referendums .
" the leaders of the 25 member states could conclude that it would be a useless and even painful exercise if it appeared that successive referendums would produce more ' no ' results , " portuguese foreign minister diogo freitas do amaral told portuguese state television .
but it appears that some of those countries where referendums were planned are still anxious to exercise their democratic right , even if it means giving brussels another bloody nose .
a poll published in the newspaper politiken over the weekend shows that a 53 percent of danes still want to go ahead with the vote set for sept .
27 , even though four separate surveys have indicated that a majority in denmark , who earlier favored the eu constitution , now oppose it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , ireland , luxembourg , poland and portugal are still scheduled to hold ballots .
britain announced monday that it was shelving plans for a referendum on the constitution until its fate became clearer .
according to carsten berg , such a decision does little to increase democracy in a europe already accused by many to be suffering from a " democratic deficit . "
even if the other countries look like they will say ' no ' , he said , their voices should still be heard .
" it is unfair that only the dutch and french should decide for other europeans , " he said .
according to him , the referendum process around the constitution was flawed in itself , with sometimes one-sided campaigns with more populism than policy content .
he added that the idea of staggering the votes over almost two years , a strategic choice on the part of eu officials , was mistaken from the ' yes ' camp perspective as it had the opposite effect of what was intended .
the staggered votes were meant to unleash a domino effect since the countries that were thought firmly on the ' yes ' side were scheduled early on .
their affirmative votes would , in theory , encourage voters in other member states to also check the ' yes ' box when their turns came .
" it all went wrong .
the dominos fell the other way , " berg said .
here to stay although politicians right now are in a state of shock regarding last week 's ballots , berg and marco incerti of ceps both believe that in the long run , the rough-and-tumble world of the referendum is here to stay and politicians will have to get used to it .

" people enjoyed sending a message to their leaders , we saw that in the high turnout rates , " said incerti .
" it would be difficult for politicians to say , ' no , we are going to take it back . " '
democracy is not always pretty , added berg , nor does it always run in the direction that politicians and bureaucrats plan .

" i am delighted that the commission has been able to give the go-ahead to this project for a public-service television channel , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes . the commission said that , although the project involved state aid , " it could nevertheless be authorized as a project financing a service of general economic interest . " " the commission also concluded that the project offered sufficient guarantees against the risk of distortion of competition , for example by preventing unjustified transfers of public funds to france television and tf1 , who will be shareholders in the future channel , " it said . chirac unhappy at ' biased ' iraq reporting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac president jacques chirac championed the idea of the new network during the diplomatic spat with the united states in the run-up to the iraq war .
he was said to be unhappy with the way french policies were presented on international stations such as britain 's bbc world and the us-based cnn . jo gröbel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " gröbel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " president 's pet project realized but a french-language international television channel has been one of chirac 's pet projects for some time .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , the french president has championed the creation of such a channel for over three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then , in an interim report in 2003 , parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war from the western viewpoint with al-jazeera the main broadcaster in the arab world . the conclusion of that report was for the french to push for the channel that has now been approved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2005 blair gets african aid pledge from bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is confident bush will open the white house coffers for africa us president george bush was to pledge $ 674 million in new aid for africa at a summit on tuesday with british leader tony blair .
but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty . british prime minister tony blair said in washington on tuesday he was hopeful britain would soon make an agreement with the united states on debt relief that would be a cornerstone of his plan to raise $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.3 billion euros -rrb- for the world 's poorest countries . speaking ahead of talks with us president george w. bush , blair said he was still aiming to reach the $ 25 billion figure before britain hosts a summit of the group of eight industrial powers next month at gleneagles in scotland . blair is in washington to press for us support for his plans to give a major boost to africa 's finances .
the us government would play a key role in any debt relief plan that stands a chance of success . " i think we are a significant way towards a deal -lrb- with the us -rrb- , and that would be very important if we can do it , " blair told reporters at the british embassy in washington .
" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

" there are still issues that need to be resolved -lrb- and -rrb- i am increasingly hopeful that we will get it , " blair added . blair said " my aim before the gleneagles summit is that we end up with the aid that the commission for africa report indicated , which is an extra $ 25 billion . "
the international commission was set up by britain to report to the g8 summit . the talks with bush are set to be dominated by africa and global climate change , two issues that blair has made priorities during its term in charge of the g8 agenda . white house pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house announced that the united states would offer another $ 674 million for humanitarian aid for africa at the bush-blair talks and the british leader welcome this while commenting " there is a lot more that needs to be dealt with " . " i think the -lrb- us -rrb- administration itself has made this clear , this is not the only commitment that they have made . "
the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen .

the white house said the new money came on top of $ 1.4 billion already committed to a un fund for africa . " of course this is important , we welcome what the administration has done ... but there is a lot more that needs to be done , " said the british prime minister .
bush was not dragging his feet over africa , blair insisted to the financial times before leaving for washington earlier in the day . on the issue , the us president had " set out a whole series of steps where those words , in other people 's mouths , would be seen as quite radical " , blair said . global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his interview , blair was also positive about seeing progress on moves to tackle climate change , an issue the united states generally views with far less urgency than britain and many other european nations do . his attempts to find global consensus on the issue ahead of the g8 summit were " very ambitious " , blair admitted to the london-based paper , while refusing to be downcast .
" wait and see .
there 's all sorts of ways people can get into this argument , " he said . " we are at the beginning of the process .
this is the first proper -lrb- opportunity to -rrb- sit down and talk about this and go through it all in a lot of detail between myself and the president .
so i 'd wait till you get to gleneagles before it 's clear exactly what 's going to happen . " blair 's whirlwind visit to washington - he returns to london later tuesday - is among a rapid round of trips to g8 nations he is making before the summit . blair looking for payback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us leg had been touted as a chance for blair to try to cash in some of the political capital he built up by backing the us-led iraq war of march 2003 , something which cost the british leader dearly at home . a month ago , blair was returned to power for a third straight term in office , but with a greatly reduced parliamentary majority - something caused in no small part by the iraq effect . many pundits say that blair is viewing his g8 agenda as a chance to secure his place in the history books in what he has already promised will be a final term as prime minister . still , most agree that however much bush wants to oblige his close ally , he is unlikely to budge too far on key issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain faces resistance to african aid plan britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .

things have marched on since 1955 , when the presence of german troops was unimaginable .
now german keeps peace across the world . just under a decade after the end of the war , on june 7 , 1955 , the federal republic of germany inaugurated its very own ministry of defense . in essence it was really just a case of renaming the authorities - the so-called " blank bureau " - which had been responsible for defense issues since 1950 . it was named after a christian democratic politician , theodor blank , who served as the " chancellor 's plenipotentiary for issues relating to the expansion of allied troops . " speaking all those years ago , blank , who was made the federal republic 's first defense minister , outlined the difficulties of any kind of military mission for the fledgling state . bildunterschrift : theodor blank -lrb- 2nd right -rrb- and contemporaries " we are confronted with a new and difficult challenge , " he said .
" we have to build troops from nothing , with no reference point to existing units .
and we have to do it in a state which is bogged down in a heavy past , in a young democracy , which often struggles with its appearance among its own people . " long and winding road to agreement arriving at the point where west germany was given the go-ahead to rearm involved five years of tiring complex negotiations with the united states , britain and france . the first opportunity for discussions on germany 's contribution to defense issues came in 1950 with the korean war and plans for a european army with a german contingent .
but the european defense community treaty collapsed at the eleventh hour following resistance from britain and france . the search for a solution eventually led to the paris pacts , the four international agreements signed in paris in october 1954 , which ended allied occupation of west germany , restored full sovereignty to the state and secured it access to nato . courting controversy unsurprisingly , the idea that the nation was preparing to rearm its youth became a highly controversial issue among both politicians and the public .
advocates not only spoke of their wish for a sovereign state capable of self-defense , but referred to the fragile cold war security situation and the dangers of a soviet attack . but opponents , including the social democrats argued that the war was still too fresh a memory to consider rearming , and that in creating a military force , it would drive the wedge of division even deeper into germany , thus provoking the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first soldiers are sworn in to the bundeswehr but the contra voices were not loud enough to prevent adenauer 's government from pushing ahead with the creation of a military body to be rooted in the constitution and controlled by parliament . " we want troops in the democracy who comply with the seniority of politics .
they should respect the principles of constitutional legality , take the civic rights and duties seriously and recognise the dignity of the people , " theodor blank told parliament in june 1955 . a few months later , on nov .
12 , 1955 , which was also the 200th birthday of prussian general and military reformer , gerhard von scharnhorst , the first 101 volunteer soldiers were sworn in . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de students on target for the bundeswehr as germany 's defense ministry and its armed forces prepare to celebrate 50 years of existence , the german army - the bundeswehr - continues to raise its profile by giving students the opportunity to handle firearms .

siemens will book pretax costs of 350 million euros on the sale .
full financial details were not disclosed , but the deal essentially means siemens is paying benq to take the business , which is losing 1.5 million euros a day .
workers will stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq ceo k.y. lee showing off a cell phone at a meeting in bombay under terms of the deal , benq can use the siemens brand name for five years .
the taiwanese company will take over the 6,000 people employed in the business " under existing contractual conditions , " siemens said .
siemens will buy 50 million euros worth of new shares in benq , giving it a 2.5 percent stake in the firm .
the takeover is expected to be completed by the end of september , the last quarter of siemens ' financial year .
the company will remain headquartered in munich .
" benq 's and siemens ' mobile phone businesses complement each excellently other in terms of technology and geography as well , " siemens said in a statement .
" this will give benq , which up until now has been very strong in asia , access to the european and latin american markets . "
falling market share for months now , siemens has been actively seeking a partner for its cellular business , which has booked hundreds of millions in losses over the past year .
siemens had been trying until the last minute to sell the business to motorola , but the us firm finally pulled out of talks , newspaper reports said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens m65 cell phone siemens saw a severe decrease in market share over the past year due to price wars in the cell phone market and internal problems such as a serious software breakdown in its new models .
in the first quarter , the brand was in fifth place in the world cell phone market ; by the time of the sale it had slipped to seventh place .
the buyout with benq is expected to boost it to the fourth place in the worldwide market .
new focus at siemens the disposal accelerates siemens 's retreat from consumer electronics as the company focuses on industrial goods such as turbines , trains and automation equipment .
siemens follows other european manufacturers including alcatel and ericsson in giving up all or part of their businesses to asian competitors to expand distribution networks and lower production costs in addition to mobile phones , benq makes flat screens for computers , laptops , and cd-rom drives .
in terms of mobile phones , just a third of benq 's production is under its own name ; it produces the others for manufacturers like market-leader nokia . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens calling for help german technology giant siemens wednesday announced a tumble in profits for its second quarter and said it was looking for a partner for its beleaguered mobile phone unit .

it has been shown in captivity that they can socially learn - they can imitate michael krützen , university of zürich biologists observing the dolphins in eastern shark bay saw the animals break marine sponges off the seafloor and wear them over their snouts to probe into the seafloor for fish .
sponging was mostly confined to females - only one out of the 13 regular spongers looked at by the study was male .
" it looks like the animals use the sponge as a kind of glove to probe the -lsb- sediments -rsb- .
it might just give them protection against some noxious critters hiding in there , " said michael krützen , of the university of zürich in switzerland , co-author of the study .
" but they might also be able to chase other fish living on the seafloor .
that 's what it looks like from the surface .
we ca n't go in the water ; shark bay was given its name for a reason , " he told the bbc news website .
all in the genes ?
if genetic explanations for sponging could be discounted , it was likely the behaviour was passed from mother to daughter through learning .
to investigate possible genetic factors , the team took small tissue samples from the dorsal fins of 185 sponging and non-sponging dolphins for dna analysis .
demi the dolphin has a mother and daughter that are also spongers results from mithochondrial dna -lrb- mtdna -rrb- - which is passed down the maternal line only - suggested spongers were part of a close-knit family group with a recent common ancestor - a " sponging eve " if you like .
this suggested transmission of sponging within a single " matriline " -lrb- a related group of animals linked by descent through the female line -rrb- , but did not resolve whether it was learnt or inherited .
a complex pattern of inheritance based on multiple genes that can be shuffled during sexual reproduction was considered unlikely .
" why , then , would it be confined to one maternal line ? "
dr krützen proffered .
so the researchers investigated whether sponging might be inherited via a single gene .
none of the 10 possible single-gene scenarios they considered matched what researchers saw in the field .
' recent switch ' " it 's really hard to make genetic arguments for recent switches in behaviour , because things do n't happen that quickly in populations , " commented grant pogson , an evolutionary biologist at university of california , santa cruz , us .
andrew read , professor of conservation biology at duke university in beaufort , us , said : " there have been similar insights from sea otters , so it would n't particularly surprise me if it were true .
" in bottlenose dolphins in saratoga -lsb- us -rsb- there have been some suggestions that individually specific foraging behaviours are likely to be transferred from mother to daughter because of the long time they spend together . "
it is unclear why the behaviour is confined solely to females , but clues may come from a recent study of chimpanzees .
a paper published in nature last year suggested female chimps learn from their mothers how to gather termites much faster than males - who prefer to spend more of their time playing .
dr krützen added : " those who work on these animals know that if there is a prime candidate for socially transmitted behaviour - culture - in the marine mammal world , it is bottlenose dolphins . "
" it has been shown in captivity that they can socially learn - they can imitate .
if one dolphin can do it then others should be able to . "

senior ministers from the group will be in the city and are due to attend an official dinner at the cutlers ' hall .
but protestors say they should instead have the meal millions of people are forced to eat every night .
they are organising a rice picnic on devonshire green which they say will be attended by hundreds of people .
barriers and defences campaigner chris malins said : " when countries like ours are seen to be treating the poorest countries in the world unfairly , that makes the world a dangerous place .
" we can either try and solve that by putting up barriers and defences or we can really solve it by tackling poverty .

" this is as far as i can go , " he said in a televised address .
indigenous and left-wing groups have held daily demonstrations in bolivia 's main city , la paz , for weeks , and a blockade has led to shortages .
mr mesa has offered to quit before but was rejected by congress .
it is unclear whether his resignation will be agreed .
congress could meet as early as tuesday to discuss the move .
but the bbc 's elliott gotkine in la paz says even if parliament accepts the resignation , it may not be enough to end the current crisis as the man who would succeed him - congress president hormando vaca diez - is unpopular with protesters .
demand for rights two weeks of road blocks have begun affecting the supply of fuel and food into la paz .
q & a : bolivia in crisis the protests erupted last month after a law was passed imposing taxes on foreign companies that have invested in bolivia 's gas reserves , which are the second largest in south america .
the protesters said the law did not go far enough and called for the gas industry to be nationalised .
they also want constitutional reforms to give greater rights to the country 's impoverished highlanders , most of whom are of indigenous descent .
the demonstrators oppose demands from bolivia 's resource-rich eastern provinces for greater autonomy and more foreign investment .
televised resignation mr mesa tried to calm the protests last week by signing a decree approving a special assembly that could change the constitution .
but the protesters vowed to continue their action until the constituent assembly is guaranteed by congress and the country 's natural gas resources are nationalised .
as clashes erupted between police and the protesters in la paz on monday , mr mesa left the presidential palace in the city under an armed escort .
he later appeared on national television to announce his resignation .
in an emotional address , he accused the protesters of intransigence and of taking advantage of his promise not to use force against them .
on sunday the president met church leaders and politicians to discuss the possibility of a snap election .
mr vaca diez , who was at the meeting , said it was " an idea that is gaining momentum as a way out of the problem " .
roman catholic cardinal julio terrazas has called for an end to the protests , saying they have " choked the residents of la paz and have hurt most of all the poor " .

" this is as far as i can go , " he said in a televised address .
indigenous and left-wing groups have held daily demonstrations in bolivia 's main city , la paz , for weeks , and a blockade has led to shortages .
mr mesa has offered to quit before but was rejected by congress .
it is unclear whether his resignation will be agreed .
congress could meet as early as tuesday to discuss the move .
but the bbc 's elliott gotkine in la paz says even if parliament accepts the resignation , it may not be enough to end the current crisis as the man who would succeed him - congress president hormando vaca diez - is unpopular with protesters .
demand for rights two weeks of road blocks have begun affecting the supply of fuel and food into la paz .
q & a : bolivia in crisis the protests erupted last month after a law was passed imposing taxes on foreign companies that have invested in bolivia 's gas reserves , which are the second largest in south america .
the protesters said the law did not go far enough and called for the gas industry to be nationalised .
they also want constitutional reforms to give greater rights to the country 's impoverished highlanders , most of whom are of indigenous descent .
the demonstrators oppose demands from bolivia 's resource-rich eastern provinces for greater autonomy and more foreign investment .
televised resignation mr mesa tried to calm the protests last week by signing a decree approving a special assembly that could change the constitution .
but the protesters vowed to continue their action until the constituent assembly is guaranteed by congress and the country 's natural gas resources are nationalised .
as clashes erupted between police and the protesters in la paz on monday , mr mesa left the presidential palace in the city under an armed escort .
he later appeared on national television to announce his resignation .
in an emotional address , he accused the protesters of intransigence and of taking advantage of his promise not to use force against them .
on sunday the president met church leaders and politicians to discuss the possibility of a snap election .
mr vaca diez , who was at the meeting , said it was " an idea that is gaining momentum as a way out of the problem " .
roman catholic cardinal julio terrazas has called for an end to the protests , saying they have " choked the residents of la paz and have hurt most of all the poor " .

in an exclusive interview for the week in week out programme , phillip shortman claims his crime spree was simple to conduct and hugely profitable .
the pontypool teenager described his crimes as " really easy " .
shortman , 18 , was detained for 12 months at cardiff crown court in may after admitting 21 counts of fraud .
the judge said he had shown " a sublime contempt for the law " by selling non-existent goods using the online auction site .
the teenager deceived more than 100 ebay customers over a 13-month period .
he spent the money on top of the range computer equipment , hi-fis and flat-screen televisions , as well as designer clothes and hiring stretch limousines . "
it was really just all greed and it 's just having the money there " phillip shortman , fraudster in an interview , shortman told week in week out about the simplicity of his crimes .
" very easy .
really easy .
i was staying at hotels , posh hotels , i was travelling the uk , " he said .
" i was going to all the theme parks in the uk .
i was going abroad , travelled quite a bit of the world then ... so it was really just all greed and it 's just having the money there .
" i used to sell cds - £ 17 , £ 20 a disc , and one time i just could n't be bothered to send the disc off .
" i waited a few weeks and nothing came of it .
and it just sort of went on from there - selling discs and not sending the items ...
i had no e-mails , or phone calls or letter , so i just took it to a higher level . "
" i was new , someone new to e bay , and rather naïve " michael davies , victim one of shortman 's victims was michael davies , a retired telecoms engineer from coventry .
he lost over £ 1,000 when trying to buy a set of mobile phones from philip shortman .
" i was new , someone new to e bay , and rather naïve ... and did n't really look for the obvious flags , like the fact that he had no feedback . "
mr davies tried several times to contact shortman - but to no avail .
" each time i contacted him - his child had been taken ill or whatever .
there was a series of excuses , " he said .
but shortman showed little sympathy for his victims .
" i thought they were stupid , to actually put that much trust in somebody that they do n't even know , " he said .
" i would never do that myself .
i would never send money to someone that i 've never met . "
apology ebay 's uk head of trust and security , garreth griffith , apologised to the victims .
" we 've learnt a lot from this case , certainly we have , and we have adjusted our technologies and processes accordingly , as we always do , " he said. ebay said it now has a thousand people working worldwide in order to combat fraud .
" i do n't like it when things like this happen , " said mr griffith .
" it 's my role to prevent this .
we learn a lot , we move on and we improve our systems .
we are fundamentally , fundamentally committed to making it a safe place to trade . "
the " superhighway robbery " documentary also looks at other growing forms of e-crime , including ' phishing attacks ' , where bogus e-mails encourage people to divulge their bank security details .

" for one person , ' language is our biggest asset and should be capitalised upon ' , while another felt the development would provide ' an opportunity to promote welsh language and culture to a very wide audience , " the report added .
it said the project would have " a significant and unavoidable effect on the language and culture of north west wales " .
but it said that could work in either direction , " either as a further blow to an already precarious situation , or as an exemplary effort to safeguard and sustain the indigenous culture and tongue " .

the mersey wave was taken down in 2003 because its metal fins were moving incorrectly during strong winds .
the problem has been overcome by a lattice structure at the top of each fin allowing wind to pass through .
speke boulevard was closed on monday night so the sculpture , which straddles the dual carriageway , could be rebuilt .
the 100ft tall sculpture is the size of seven double-decker buses and originally took six months to build .
wind tunnel tests but just weeks after its installation in november 2003 it was taken down when designers noticed its 12 fins - which each weigh three-and-a-half tonnes - were not moving as anticipated during high winds .
various computer and wind tunnel tests have since been carried out to ensure that it is safe .
it is 30ft taller than gateshead 's famous angel of the north and is designed to be viewed from a moving car .
it was commissioned by the liverpool land development company and designed by the czech artist peter fink in collaboration with urban designer igor marko of art2architecture .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- michael jackson : trial of the century ?

michael jackson 's court case was expected to be the " trial of the century " - but after just three months and few of the promised celebrity witnesses , has it lived up to its billing ?
michael jackson did not give evidence himself there are few stars more famous than michael jackson and few charges more serious than sexually abusing a young boy .
yet there is a sense that the singer 's trial has not caught the public 's interest as much as many had expected .
" forget the century , it was n't even the cultural story of the spring , " says robert thompson , professor of popular culture and director for the centre for the study of popular television at syracuse university .
" it turns out more people were talking about american idol by a long shot . "
the assumption that 24-hour news channels would go into a constant " michael cycle " was wrong , he explains .
tv reconstructions have been filmed in the absence of real footage " it turns out that as a massive news story over here , as another trial of the century , it really did n't live up to it .
it was no oj , by any stretch of the imagination . "
for news channel cnn , there has been big interest in what is " a very important story on many different levels " , according to nick wrenn , managing editor of cnn europe , middle east and africa .
" there 's been a fair degree of coverage - but not the kind of wall-to-wall you would have expected .
certainly not the kind of coverage we saw with the oj simpson trial . "
that is partly because judge rodney melville refused to let the trial be televised , saying he did not want it to become a " circus " .
so , reconstructions aside , people have been unable to get hooked on following the soap opera-like drama in their living rooms every night .
when the oj simpson case became a media event as well as a murder trial 10 years ago , action such as simpson trying on a pair of blood-stained gloves in court kept viewers hooked .
but this time , there has been little on-screen excitement , except mr jackson shuffling into court in his pyjamas .
" even if there was complete access to cameras in the court , i still do n't think this would have reached that -lsb- oj-like -rsb- level of cultural penetration , " prof thompson says .
previous accusations " what was happening in the courtroom was not that new or all that interesting to people who had been hearing about this michael jackson business since 1992 when the first accusation came in . "
in the courtroom , there has been some drama amid proceedings that have ranged from the banal to the surreal .
but it has not been compelling enough for most ordinary observers to want to read or hear blow-by-blow accounts every day .
the dramatic moments included appearances by former wife debbie rowe , actor macaulay culkin and janet arvizo , mother of mr jackson 's teenage accuser gavin .
tv correspondents have been camped outside the court gavin and his brother star described the alleged abuse - but such detail made many want to squirm in discomfort rather than discuss it with friends .
" there has n't been a great deal of appetite for some of the quite graphic nature of the evidence that 's been coming out , " mr wrenn says .
" people have been inclined to switch off rather than switch on because it 's been a bit too sordid . "
for mr jackson , keeping up his performance and image became less important as the trial went on , and he chose not to take the stand in what would have been a fascinating finale .
but his image has become so bizarre that few people are shocked by anything he does any more .
and on the other side , the arvizo family were not easy for the public to relate to or sympathise with either .
mr jackson was not the only celebrity missing from the witness stand .
stars barred at the start of the trial , we were promised stars including elizabeth taylor , diana ross and stevie wonder would come to defend their friend .
but the judge decided not to allow character witnesses , restricting the celebrity count to just culkin , jay leno and chris tucker .
although the trial has not gripped the global audience , it has still not been far from the top of the news agenda .
mr wrenn says viewers wanted to know about the main evidence , but not " a drip , drip , drip daily update " .
cnn has " got that bit right " , he says .
but prof thompson adds the media as a whole has still given the story more time than it deserves .
" even the amount of michael jackson coverage that was given was disproportionately large given its importance in any kind of rational journalistic universe , " he says .

michael jackson 's court case was expected to be the " trial of the century " - but after just three months and few of the promised celebrity witnesses , has it lived up to its billing ?
michael jackson did not give evidence himself there are few stars more famous than michael jackson and few charges more serious than sexually abusing a young boy .
yet there is a sense that the singer 's trial has not caught the public 's interest as much as many had expected .
" forget the century , it was n't even the cultural story of the spring , " says robert thompson , professor of popular culture and director for the centre for the study of popular television at syracuse university .
" it turns out more people were talking about american idol by a long shot . "
the assumption that 24-hour news channels would go into a constant " michael cycle " was wrong , he explains .
tv reconstructions have been filmed in the absence of real footage " it turns out that as a massive news story over here , as another trial of the century , it really did n't live up to it .
it was no oj , by any stretch of the imagination . "
for news channel cnn , there has been big interest in what is " a very important story on many different levels " , according to nick wrenn , managing editor of cnn europe , middle east and africa .
" there 's been a fair degree of coverage - but not the kind of wall-to-wall you would have expected .
certainly not the kind of coverage we saw with the oj simpson trial . "
that is partly because judge rodney melville refused to let the trial be televised , saying he did not want it to become a " circus " .
so , reconstructions aside , people have been unable to get hooked on following the soap opera-like drama in their living rooms every night .
when the oj simpson case became a media event as well as a murder trial 10 years ago , action such as simpson trying on a pair of blood-stained gloves in court kept viewers hooked .
but this time , there has been little on-screen excitement , except mr jackson shuffling into court in his pyjamas .
" even if there was complete access to cameras in the court , i still do n't think this would have reached that -lsb- oj-like -rsb- level of cultural penetration , " prof thompson says .
previous accusations " what was happening in the courtroom was not that new or all that interesting to people who had been hearing about this michael jackson business since 1992 when the first accusation came in . "
in the courtroom , there has been some drama amid proceedings that have ranged from the banal to the surreal .
but it has not been compelling enough for most ordinary observers to want to read or hear blow-by-blow accounts every day .
the dramatic moments included appearances by former wife debbie rowe , actor macaulay culkin and janet arvizo , mother of mr jackson 's teenage accuser gavin .
tv correspondents have been camped outside the court gavin and his brother star described the alleged abuse - but such detail made many want to squirm in discomfort rather than discuss it with friends .
" there has n't been a great deal of appetite for some of the quite graphic nature of the evidence that 's been coming out , " mr wrenn says .
