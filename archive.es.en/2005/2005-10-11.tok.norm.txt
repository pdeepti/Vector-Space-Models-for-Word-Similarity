they do n't want to miss hearing the six numbers that determine who will be the country 's next instant millionaire . since the game was created , 50 years ago this week , countless germans have seen a dream come true - although for many of them , extreme wealth became a curse rather than a blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sign showing a lottery sales station at first , the lucky numbers for televised lotto drawings were picked by hand , but eventually that quaint custom made way for today 's high-tech rotating drum that shoots out plastic balls with numbers printed on them . the odds of picking six winning numbers out of 49 may be extremely long - around 1.4 million to one - but the genius of the game was that it takes virtually no skill or knowledge , and a very small investment , to play . big business today , germans spend more than five billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- each year on lotto .
in 2004 they spent a total of 30 billion euros on get-rich-quick gambling games like lotto , roulette , and slot machines . " half the adults in germany gamble regularly , " tilmann becker , leader of the newly created gambling research center at the university of hohenheim told capital magazine recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling out a lotto form the demand for a quick financial fix is so strong that despite competition from internet gambling companies , which offer much better odds , lotto and its concurrent toto were able to increase its sales in 2004 by two percent . meanwhile , the ongoing debate over the possible liberalization of gambling within the european union has flared up once again .
one of the questions to be settled in the coming months by the european parliament is whether gambling should be regulated as a service industry . in a few weeks , the european union will publish a study comparing gambling regulations across member states .
the study will also advise the eu on the possibility of opening its gambling markets , which are currently state regulated . a haven for money launderers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro millions lottery covers france , spain and england .
pictured here , a sale in paris in the run up to its publication , bookmakers - anxious for the markets to open - have been bombarding the european commission with complaints , according to the oliver drewes , spokesman for the internal markets commission .
moreover , several states have ongoing lawsuits against state-run gambling monopolies . naturally , industry representatives are warning against lifting the monopoly .
the ensuing competition would undoubtedly create " gambling grey zones " that are difficult to oversee , according to winfried wortmann , head of germany 's westlotto company and chairman of the board of the european lottery association .
given the sums of money involved , this would be " dangerous , " wortmann said . # b # the fear is that large sums of money without government oversight would be channeled off for use by criminals and money launderers . while opponents of liberalization argued that ending the state monopoly would remove a source of money that should rightfully go to state coffers , proponents said that structure is no longer up to date .
european parliamentarian joachim würmeling from germany said free competition is best for the citizens , because they can choose which games offer the best odds anywhere in europe . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope stimulates election betting after betting and winning that native son cardinal joseph ratzinger be elected to the seat of peter , more germans than ever have been drawn to gambling on this sunday 's federal elections .

it was there that , almost exactly 50 years ago , the bundeswehr was created .
despite germans ' initial postwar ambivalence toward a national armed forces , half a century later , the bundeswehr is a success story , said german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler " for five decades , the bundeswehr has been invaluable in its service to the freedom and security of the federal republic of germany , " köhler said . in his speech before gathered officials marking the bundeswehr 's 40th " commander 's congress , " köhler credited the deterrent effect of the german armed forces with having been an important condition for the end of the cold war . " never before had military might achieved so much , so peacefully , " he said . köhler spoke of the many successes of the bundeswehr , such as the incorporation of east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- after reunification as well as various foreign missions .
in the past 13 years , more than 150,000 german soldiers have served on foreign territory . " the bundeswehr has gained much recognition and respect for itself and for germany during its missions abroad , because our soldiers treat people of other nations and other cultures with respect , " köhler said . solid concept needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the german president had more than praise on his mind .
he appealed to german politicians to grant the bundeswehr not just a solid financial situation and better equipment for its foreign missions , but also a clear concept for its future role . " we need an active , not a reactive , foreign , security and defense policy - one that thinks in terms of its own interests , and not just institutional mechanisms , " köhler said . but a definition of german interests - the question of when , and for what reasons , german soldiers should risk their lives overseas and when they should end their missions - is still lacking . " the bundeswehr will be restructured , away from a self-defense force , but toward what ?
a deployment army ?
an interventionist force ? "
köhler asked .
" the german parliament has approved the foreign deployment of german soldiers more than 40 times , but that does n't appear to resonate much with germans . " future of conscription bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits during basic training since 1957 , the bundeswehr has relied on obligatory military service for civilians , a system that lent the armed forces the ability to mobilize big reserves in a short time .
but that 's an ability that has largely become obsolete with the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , köhler is in favor of maintaining conscription . " i 'm convinced of the merits of military service , and it 's my wish that the system will have a future , " said köhler .
" it leads many qualified people to the bundeswehr ; it keeps our forces rooted in the nation ; and it has a beneficial effect on our common character . " although many military experts have long demanded that germany join the ranks of other european nations that have switched to a professional army , the future of military service now appears to be secure in the medium term .
under the new grand coalition , both of the parties making up the next government have for years been firm supporters of military service . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how two armies became one the reunification of germany in 1990 not only meant the unity of political entities .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

it was there that , almost exactly 50 years ago , the bundeswehr was created .

" never before had military might achieved so much , so peacefully , " he said . köhler spoke of the many successes of the bundeswehr , such as the incorporation of east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- after reunification as well as various foreign missions .
in the past 13 years , more than 150,000 german soldiers have served on foreign territory .

" we need an active , not a reactive , foreign , security and defense policy - one that thinks in terms of its own interests , and not just institutional mechanisms , " köhler said . but a definition of german interests - the question of when , and for what reasons , german soldiers should risk their lives overseas and when they should end their missions - is still lacking . " the bundeswehr will be restructured , away from a self-defense force , but toward what ?

despite this , köhler is in favor of maintaining conscription . " i 'm convinced of the merits of military service , and it 's my wish that the system will have a future , " said köhler .
" it leads many qualified people to the bundeswehr ; it keeps our forces rooted in the nation ; and it has a beneficial effect on our common character .

they do n't want to miss hearing the six numbers that determine who will be the country 's next instant millionaire . since the game was created , 50 years ago this week , countless germans have seen a dream come true - although for many of them , extreme wealth became a curse rather than a blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sign showing a lottery sales station at first , the lucky numbers for televised lotto drawings were picked by hand , but eventually that quaint custom made way for today 's high-tech rotating drum that shoots out plastic balls with numbers printed on them . the odds of picking six winning numbers out of 49 may be extremely long - around 1.4 million to one - but the genius of the game was that it takes virtually no skill or knowledge , and a very small investment , to play . big business today , germans spend more than five billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- each year on lotto .
in 2004 they spent a total of 30 billion euros on get-rich-quick gambling games like lotto , roulette , and slot machines . " half the adults in germany gamble regularly , " tilmann becker , leader of the newly created gambling research center at the university of hohenheim told capital magazine recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling out a lotto form the demand for a quick financial fix is so strong that despite competition from internet gambling companies , which offer much better odds , lotto and its concurrent toto were able to increase its sales in 2004 by two percent . meanwhile , the ongoing debate over the possible liberalization of gambling within the european union has flared up once again .
one of the questions to be settled in the coming months by the european parliament is whether gambling should be regulated as a service industry . in a few weeks , the european union will publish a study comparing gambling regulations across member states .
the study will also advise the eu on the possibility of opening its gambling markets , which are currently state regulated . a haven for money launderers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro millions lottery covers france , spain and england .
pictured here , a sale in paris in the run up to its publication , bookmakers - anxious for the markets to open - have been bombarding the european commission with complaints , according to the oliver drewes , spokesman for the internal markets commission .
moreover , several states have ongoing lawsuits against state-run gambling monopolies . naturally , industry representatives are warning against lifting the monopoly .
the ensuing competition would undoubtedly create " gambling grey zones " that are difficult to oversee , according to winfried wortmann , head of germany 's westlotto company and chairman of the board of the european lottery association .
given the sums of money involved , this would be " dangerous , " wortmann said . # b # the fear is that large sums of money without government oversight would be channeled off for use by criminals and money launderers . while opponents of liberalization argued that ending the state monopoly would remove a source of money that should rightfully go to state coffers , proponents said that structure is no longer up to date .
european parliamentarian joachim würmeling from germany said free competition is best for the citizens , because they can choose which games offer the best odds anywhere in europe . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope stimulates election betting after betting and winning that native son cardinal joseph ratzinger be elected to the seat of peter , more germans than ever have been drawn to gambling on this sunday 's federal elections .

they do n't want to miss hearing the six numbers that determine who will be the country 's next instant millionaire . since the game was created , 50 years ago this week , countless germans have seen a dream come true - although for many of them , extreme wealth became a curse rather than a blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sign showing a lottery sales station at first , the lucky numbers for televised lotto drawings were picked by hand , but eventually that quaint custom made way for today 's high-tech rotating drum that shoots out plastic balls with numbers printed on them . the odds of picking six winning numbers out of 49 may be extremely long - around 1.4 million to one - but the genius of the game was that it takes virtually no skill or knowledge , and a very small investment , to play . big business today , germans spend more than five billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- each year on lotto .
in 2004 they spent a total of 30 billion euros on get-rich-quick gambling games like lotto , roulette , and slot machines . " half the adults in germany gamble regularly , " tilmann becker , leader of the newly created gambling research center at the university of hohenheim told capital magazine recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling out a lotto form the demand for a quick financial fix is so strong that despite competition from internet gambling companies , which offer much better odds , lotto and its concurrent toto were able to increase its sales in 2004 by two percent . meanwhile , the ongoing debate over the possible liberalization of gambling within the european union has flared up once again .

the ensuing competition would undoubtedly create " gambling grey zones " that are difficult to oversee , according to winfried wortmann , head of germany 's westlotto company and chairman of the board of the european lottery association .
given the sums of money involved , this would be " dangerous , " wortmann said . # b # the fear is that large sums of money without government oversight would be channeled off for use by criminals and money launderers . while opponents of liberalization argued that ending the state monopoly would remove a source of money that should rightfully go to state coffers , proponents said that structure is no longer up to date .
european parliamentarian joachim würmeling from germany said free competition is best for the citizens , because they can choose which games offer the best odds anywhere in europe . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope stimulates election betting after betting and winning that native son cardinal joseph ratzinger be elected to the seat of peter , more germans than ever have been drawn to gambling on this sunday 's federal elections .

they do n't want to miss hearing the six numbers that determine who will be the country 's next instant millionaire . since the game was created , 50 years ago this week , countless germans have seen a dream come true - although for many of them , extreme wealth became a curse rather than a blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sign showing a lottery sales station at first , the lucky numbers for televised lotto drawings were picked by hand , but eventually that quaint custom made way for today 's high-tech rotating drum that shoots out plastic balls with numbers printed on them . the odds of picking six winning numbers out of 49 may be extremely long - around 1.4 million to one - but the genius of the game was that it takes virtually no skill or knowledge , and a very small investment , to play . big business today , germans spend more than five billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- each year on lotto .
in 2004 they spent a total of 30 billion euros on get-rich-quick gambling games like lotto , roulette , and slot machines . " half the adults in germany gamble regularly , " tilmann becker , leader of the newly created gambling research center at the university of hohenheim told capital magazine recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling out a lotto form the demand for a quick financial fix is so strong that despite competition from internet gambling companies , which offer much better odds , lotto and its concurrent toto were able to increase its sales in 2004 by two percent . meanwhile , the ongoing debate over the possible liberalization of gambling within the european union has flared up once again .
one of the questions to be settled in the coming months by the european parliament is whether gambling should be regulated as a service industry . in a few weeks , the european union will publish a study comparing gambling regulations across member states .
the study will also advise the eu on the possibility of opening its gambling markets , which are currently state regulated . a haven for money launderers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro millions lottery covers france , spain and england .
pictured here , a sale in paris in the run up to its publication , bookmakers - anxious for the markets to open - have been bombarding the european commission with complaints , according to the oliver drewes , spokesman for the internal markets commission .
moreover , several states have ongoing lawsuits against state-run gambling monopolies . naturally , industry representatives are warning against lifting the monopoly .
the ensuing competition would undoubtedly create " gambling grey zones " that are difficult to oversee , according to winfried wortmann , head of germany 's westlotto company and chairman of the board of the european lottery association .
given the sums of money involved , this would be " dangerous , " wortmann said . # b # the fear is that large sums of money without government oversight would be channeled off for use by criminals and money launderers . while opponents of liberalization argued that ending the state monopoly would remove a source of money that should rightfully go to state coffers , proponents said that structure is no longer up to date .
european parliamentarian joachim würmeling from germany said free competition is best for the citizens , because they can choose which games offer the best odds anywhere in europe . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope stimulates election betting after betting and winning that native son cardinal joseph ratzinger be elected to the seat of peter , more germans than ever have been drawn to gambling on this sunday 's federal elections .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "

" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .

they do n't want to miss hearing the six numbers that determine who will be the country 's next instant millionaire . since the game was created , 50 years ago this week , countless germans have seen a dream come true - although for many of them , extreme wealth became a curse rather than a blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sign showing a lottery sales station at first , the lucky numbers for televised lotto drawings were picked by hand , but eventually that quaint custom made way for today 's high-tech rotating drum that shoots out plastic balls with numbers printed on them . the odds of picking six winning numbers out of 49 may be extremely long - around 1.4 million to one - but the genius of the game was that it takes virtually no skill or knowledge , and a very small investment , to play . big business today , germans spend more than five billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- each year on lotto .
in 2004 they spent a total of 30 billion euros on get-rich-quick gambling games like lotto , roulette , and slot machines . " half the adults in germany gamble regularly , " tilmann becker , leader of the newly created gambling research center at the university of hohenheim told capital magazine recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling out a lotto form the demand for a quick financial fix is so strong that despite competition from internet gambling companies , which offer much better odds , lotto and its concurrent toto were able to increase its sales in 2004 by two percent . meanwhile , the ongoing debate over the possible liberalization of gambling within the european union has flared up once again .
one of the questions to be settled in the coming months by the european parliament is whether gambling should be regulated as a service industry . in a few weeks , the european union will publish a study comparing gambling regulations across member states .
the study will also advise the eu on the possibility of opening its gambling markets , which are currently state regulated . a haven for money launderers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro millions lottery covers france , spain and england .
pictured here , a sale in paris in the run up to its publication , bookmakers - anxious for the markets to open - have been bombarding the european commission with complaints , according to the oliver drewes , spokesman for the internal markets commission .
moreover , several states have ongoing lawsuits against state-run gambling monopolies . naturally , industry representatives are warning against lifting the monopoly .
the ensuing competition would undoubtedly create " gambling grey zones " that are difficult to oversee , according to winfried wortmann , head of germany 's westlotto company and chairman of the board of the european lottery association .
given the sums of money involved , this would be " dangerous , " wortmann said . # b # the fear is that large sums of money without government oversight would be channeled off for use by criminals and money launderers . while opponents of liberalization argued that ending the state monopoly would remove a source of money that should rightfully go to state coffers , proponents said that structure is no longer up to date .
european parliamentarian joachim würmeling from germany said free competition is best for the citizens , because they can choose which games offer the best odds anywhere in europe . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope stimulates election betting after betting and winning that native son cardinal joseph ratzinger be elected to the seat of peter , more germans than ever have been drawn to gambling on this sunday 's federal elections .

in the past 13 years , more than 150,000 german soldiers have served on foreign territory .

" we need an active , not a reactive , foreign , security and defense policy - one that thinks in terms of its own interests , and not just institutional mechanisms , " köhler said . but a definition of german interests - the question of when , and for what reasons , german soldiers should risk their lives overseas and when they should end their missions - is still lacking . " the bundeswehr will be restructured , away from a self-defense force , but toward what ?

" it leads many qualified people to the bundeswehr ; it keeps our forces rooted in the nation ; and it has a beneficial effect on our common character .

" the hope that germany would be a shining european example for accelerated reforms has been dashed , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding . onward with reforms nevertheless , germany had already made significant progress in overhauling its economy and some of that process would still continue under a grand coalition . even deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter , who had gloomily proclaimed that germany could be on the verge of a new recession if the reform process ground to a halt , said there was some common ground for a grand coalition . " i 'm thinking of the reform of the federal system , but there could also be a common denominator in some areas in pension provisions and labor market policy that could enable small reforms to be pushed through , " walter said . stability important a grand coalition , in which the economy ministry will be headed by bavaria 's conservative leader edmund stoiber , could indeed prove more stable than some of the other groupings mooted in recent weeks , such as a three-way alliance between merkel 's cdu , the pro-business liberal fdp and the environmentalist green party , analysts said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zimmermann " federalism reform can only happen in a grand coalition .
cleaning up the budget and simplifying the tax system are other areas that could be tackled , " said the head of the berlin-based economic research institute diw , klaus zimmermann , recently . under the german parliamentary system , opposition parties tend to build a majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , putting them in a position to block key government legislation . with a grand coalition holding the majority in both the lower and upper parliamentary houses , such political stalemate , at least on matters of tax , budget and the federal system , can be avoided . sticky labor market issue the one area that the two sides may not be able to agree on is labor market reforms . merkel had vowed to slash labor costs , ease rules on hiring and firing and allow companies to opt out of collective wage bargaining and tailor wage deals to their own particular economic situation . the spd , which shifted to the left in the election campaign in response to voters ' anger at its own social reforms , is likely to resist such proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition nevertheless , all in all , a government of both spd and cdu may not be the major step backward that the markets had initially feared , and while the reform process may be slowed , it is unlikely to be abandoned altogether , analysts said . hans-werner sinn , head of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo , saw a number of advantages in a grand coalition , such as the consolidation of public spending . but most of all , the cdu and spd parties would jointly have more strength to prescribe " the necessary medicine " than they would individually , sinn said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy students on target for the bundeswehr germany -pipe- 11.10.2005 köhler : debate needed on army 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are currently playing a key role in afghanistan at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future . in order to start a public discussion about the bundeswehr 's future , around 400 representatives from the armed forces met in the place where it all began - the ermekeil barracks in bonn .
it was there that , almost exactly 50 years ago , the bundeswehr was created .
despite germans ' initial postwar ambivalence toward a national armed forces , half a century later , the bundeswehr is a success story , said german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler " for five decades , the bundeswehr has been invaluable in its service to the freedom and security of the federal republic of germany , " köhler said . in his speech before gathered officials marking the bundeswehr 's 40th " commander 's congress , " köhler credited the deterrent effect of the german armed forces with having been an important condition for the end of the cold war . " never before had military might achieved so much , so peacefully , " he said . köhler spoke of the many successes of the bundeswehr , such as the incorporation of east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- after reunification as well as various foreign missions .
in the past 13 years , more than 150,000 german soldiers have served on foreign territory . " the bundeswehr has gained much recognition and respect for itself and for germany during its missions abroad , because our soldiers treat people of other nations and other cultures with respect , " köhler said . solid concept needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the german president had more than praise on his mind .
he appealed to german politicians to grant the bundeswehr not just a solid financial situation and better equipment for its foreign missions , but also a clear concept for its future role . " we need an active , not a reactive , foreign , security and defense policy - one that thinks in terms of its own interests , and not just institutional mechanisms , " köhler said . but a definition of german interests - the question of when , and for what reasons , german soldiers should risk their lives overseas and when they should end their missions - is still lacking . " the bundeswehr will be restructured , away from a self-defense force , but toward what ?
a deployment army ?
an interventionist force ? "
köhler asked .
" the german parliament has approved the foreign deployment of german soldiers more than 40 times , but that does n't appear to resonate much with germans . " future of conscription bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits during basic training since 1957 , the bundeswehr has relied on obligatory military service for civilians , a system that lent the armed forces the ability to mobilize big reserves in a short time .
but that 's an ability that has largely become obsolete with the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , köhler is in favor of maintaining conscription . " i 'm convinced of the merits of military service , and it 's my wish that the system will have a future , " said köhler .
" it leads many qualified people to the bundeswehr ; it keeps our forces rooted in the nation ; and it has a beneficial effect on our common character . " although many military experts have long demanded that germany join the ranks of other european nations that have switched to a professional army , the future of military service now appears to be secure in the medium term .
under the new grand coalition , both of the parties making up the next government have for years been firm supporters of military service . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how two armies became one the reunification of germany in 1990 not only meant the unity of political entities .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

but it 's not a done deal until the bundestag votes her in .
dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .
helmut schmidt and helmut kohl each received only one vote more than necessary when they were elected chancellor in 1974 and 1982 respectively .
gerhard schröder got 305 votes in 2002 , just three more than he needed to be named chancellor .
minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .
if he dissolves parliament , new elections must take place within 60 days . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .
she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .
the two parties are more comfortable in their role as rivals , and there is concern that they will be unable to work together for the good of the country . merkel as policy-maker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel merkel 's ability to steer the government 's course has been called into question by both sides .
spd party leader franz müntefering said that , in such a coalition , the chancellor 's duty to make policy is " not viable . "
were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .
in those goals , and in new challenges that would arise , merkel would have a " leadership function that she will exercise . " finding common ground andreas wuest , political scientist from mannheim university , said the parties must now smooth over their differences . " it is not easy , they have to find agreement on their policies , " wuest told afp .
" but angela merkel may still be a successful chancellor , there is nothing to say that it can not last for a few years .

" i do not see a problem moving forward to tackle unemployment , " wuest said .
" the parties may not manage to agree on labor reforms that affect people in jobs , but they will try and do something about the jobless .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "
but " what if it 's not her ? " the paper asked .
the social democrats may have counted on merkel being a weak chancellor who would make it easier for them during the next elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy students on target for the bundeswehr germany -pipe- 11.10.2005 köhler : debate needed on army 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are currently playing a key role in afghanistan at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future . in order to start a public discussion about the bundeswehr 's future , around 400 representatives from the armed forces met in the place where it all began - the ermekeil barracks in bonn .
it was there that , almost exactly 50 years ago , the bundeswehr was created .
despite germans ' initial postwar ambivalence toward a national armed forces , half a century later , the bundeswehr is a success story , said german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler " for five decades , the bundeswehr has been invaluable in its service to the freedom and security of the federal republic of germany , " köhler said . in his speech before gathered officials marking the bundeswehr 's 40th " commander 's congress , " köhler credited the deterrent effect of the german armed forces with having been an important condition for the end of the cold war . " never before had military might achieved so much , so peacefully , " he said . köhler spoke of the many successes of the bundeswehr , such as the incorporation of east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- after reunification as well as various foreign missions .
in the past 13 years , more than 150,000 german soldiers have served on foreign territory . " the bundeswehr has gained much recognition and respect for itself and for germany during its missions abroad , because our soldiers treat people of other nations and other cultures with respect , " köhler said . solid concept needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the german president had more than praise on his mind .
he appealed to german politicians to grant the bundeswehr not just a solid financial situation and better equipment for its foreign missions , but also a clear concept for its future role . " we need an active , not a reactive , foreign , security and defense policy - one that thinks in terms of its own interests , and not just institutional mechanisms , " köhler said . but a definition of german interests - the question of when , and for what reasons , german soldiers should risk their lives overseas and when they should end their missions - is still lacking . " the bundeswehr will be restructured , away from a self-defense force , but toward what ?
a deployment army ?
an interventionist force ? "
köhler asked .
" the german parliament has approved the foreign deployment of german soldiers more than 40 times , but that does n't appear to resonate much with germans . " future of conscription bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits during basic training since 1957 , the bundeswehr has relied on obligatory military service for civilians , a system that lent the armed forces the ability to mobilize big reserves in a short time .
but that 's an ability that has largely become obsolete with the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , köhler is in favor of maintaining conscription . " i 'm convinced of the merits of military service , and it 's my wish that the system will have a future , " said köhler .
" it leads many qualified people to the bundeswehr ; it keeps our forces rooted in the nation ; and it has a beneficial effect on our common character . " although many military experts have long demanded that germany join the ranks of other european nations that have switched to a professional army , the future of military service now appears to be secure in the medium term .
under the new grand coalition , both of the parties making up the next government have for years been firm supporters of military service . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how two armies became one the reunification of germany in 1990 not only meant the unity of political entities .

they do n't want to miss hearing the six numbers that determine who will be the country 's next instant millionaire . since the game was created , 50 years ago this week , countless germans have seen a dream come true - although for many of them , extreme wealth became a curse rather than a blessing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sign showing a lottery sales station at first , the lucky numbers for televised lotto drawings were picked by hand , but eventually that quaint custom made way for today 's high-tech rotating drum that shoots out plastic balls with numbers printed on them . the odds of picking six winning numbers out of 49 may be extremely long - around 1.4 million to one - but the genius of the game was that it takes virtually no skill or knowledge , and a very small investment , to play . big business today , germans spend more than five billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- each year on lotto .
in 2004 they spent a total of 30 billion euros on get-rich-quick gambling games like lotto , roulette , and slot machines . " half the adults in germany gamble regularly , " tilmann becker , leader of the newly created gambling research center at the university of hohenheim told capital magazine recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling out a lotto form the demand for a quick financial fix is so strong that despite competition from internet gambling companies , which offer much better odds , lotto and its concurrent toto were able to increase its sales in 2004 by two percent . meanwhile , the ongoing debate over the possible liberalization of gambling within the european union has flared up once again .
one of the questions to be settled in the coming months by the european parliament is whether gambling should be regulated as a service industry . in a few weeks , the european union will publish a study comparing gambling regulations across member states .
the study will also advise the eu on the possibility of opening its gambling markets , which are currently state regulated . a haven for money launderers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro millions lottery covers france , spain and england .
pictured here , a sale in paris in the run up to its publication , bookmakers - anxious for the markets to open - have been bombarding the european commission with complaints , according to the oliver drewes , spokesman for the internal markets commission .
moreover , several states have ongoing lawsuits against state-run gambling monopolies . naturally , industry representatives are warning against lifting the monopoly .
the ensuing competition would undoubtedly create " gambling grey zones " that are difficult to oversee , according to winfried wortmann , head of germany 's westlotto company and chairman of the board of the european lottery association .
given the sums of money involved , this would be " dangerous , " wortmann said . # b # the fear is that large sums of money without government oversight would be channeled off for use by criminals and money launderers . while opponents of liberalization argued that ending the state monopoly would remove a source of money that should rightfully go to state coffers , proponents said that structure is no longer up to date .
european parliamentarian joachim würmeling from germany said free competition is best for the citizens , because they can choose which games offer the best odds anywhere in europe . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope stimulates election betting after betting and winning that native son cardinal joseph ratzinger be elected to the seat of peter , more germans than ever have been drawn to gambling on this sunday 's federal elections .

and during the ensuing weeks of political haggling , offermann was unsure whether or not he would have to shelve his plans to create a 46-centimeter effigy of the former physicist from east germany . on monday , it became clear that work on angie , the doll , could continue .
she will be following in the exalted footsteps of other offermann creations such as the dalai lama and pope benedict xvi . angie the doll wo n't exactly be all dolled up in her plastic form .
she 'll be wearing simple , dark blue pants and a lavender t-shirt and will have a hair-do that 's pretty close to the coif she has in real life .
according to offermann , the future chancellor has a " unique style " that was not difficult to translate into doll form .
she 'll be unveiled officially next monday . but girls who might want their parents to buy an angie doll to perhaps preside over a cabinet or barbies and kens will have to do some serious lobbying .
angie does n't come cheap - her retail price will be 185 euros -lrb- $ 222 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of dw-world 's " and finally … " brings you news on weird and wacky happenings from all over germany .

any slip up could mean further derision for klinsmann 's men . germany have hit a wall of criticism in their build-up for the 2006 world cup on home soil and know the knives will be sharpened again should they fail to swat aside china in wednesday 's friendly in hamburg . after a positive 2005 confederations cup , when they reached the semi-finals , germany looked to be on the up but a 2-1 reverse in turkey on saturday represented another setback . " i had too much to do in that game and expect an improvement , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we are being criticized and deservedly so .
but we should not panic and just make sure we turn in a good performance against china . " a 2-0 defeat in slovakia and flattering 2-2 draw with the netherlands has persuaded the media to laugh off claims from jürgen klinsmann that lifting the world cup is realistic . " the criticism we are receiving is fair but we should not hide from it , " declared klinsmann .
" our aim to become world champions has not changed despite recent results . " kaiser criticizes klinsi 's transatlantic lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup winners beckenbauer and klinsmann are at odds over the best way to regain the trophy germany 's performances of late have not been the only fuel for the fire .
west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer has called for klinsmann to spend more time in his homeland ahead of the 2006 world cup finals . klinsmann has resided in the united states since taking charge in july 2004 , often jetting back to his californian home after matches , but beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , feels that can not continue in the build-up to the finals . " in the world cup year he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- should spend more time in germany than the united states , " declared beckenbauer .
" that way he would avoid constant criticism that he is never here . " klinsmann has maintained that he can get a different perspective by living outside of germany but the poor recent results have increased the pressure . " the criticism that has surfaced now is an indication of what it will be like next year , " added beckenbauer .
" a world cup is never easy for any manager . " ballack to miss china clash as pressure increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a result against the likes of china on wednesday may hold off the criticism for a while but germany have to improve .
they face the chinese without bayern munich star michael ballack who will be missing again with the flu but even without their captain germany are expected to see off china at the aol-arena . the warm-up game has an added twist in that sv hamburg will net the match proceeds - expected to reach 1.5 million euros - as compensation for the robert hoyer match-fixing scandal .
in january tainted referee hoyzer admitted to rigging sc paderborn 's 4-2 shock cup victory over hamburg in august 2004 . germany will want to ensure that the underdogs do not come away with a win on wednesday evening and fc cologne striker lukas podolski insists china would not be underestimated .
" we need to play at 100 percent in every game whether we are facing china , liechtenstein or brazil , " stated podolski . chinese would love a big scalp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soccer fans beat drums prior to start of 2002 world cup group c soccer match between china and costa rica , gwangju world cup stadium , south korea , photo having failed to qualify for the 2006 world cup china 's next big challenge is the 2008 olympic games in peking . two chinese stars of the english premiership - everton 's li tie and manchester city 's sun jihai - are two of the big players in the china set-up and manager zhu guanghu admits his team will play on the counter attack .
" we need to switch defense into attack very quickly , " said guanghu .
" this will be a good learning curve for us .

dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .

minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .

18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .
helmut schmidt and helmut kohl each received only one vote more than necessary when they were elected chancellor in 1974 and 1982 respectively .
gerhard schröder got 305 votes in 2002 , just three more than he needed to be named chancellor .
minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .
if he dissolves parliament , new elections must take place within 60 days . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

girls who want that role model will have to get the new angela merkel doll . not everyone is deemed worthy of getting his or her own likeness in a doll , but doll maker marcel offermann thought the fact that angela merkel will be germany 's first female chancellor was worth putting his skills to work . it almost did n't happen , just as there was some doubt as to whether merkel would actually enter the history books as the first woman to make it to the very top of german politics .

she 'll be wearing simple , dark blue pants and a lavender t-shirt and will have a hair-do that 's pretty close to the coif she has in real life .
according to offermann , the future chancellor has a " unique style " that was not difficult to translate into doll form .
she 'll be unveiled officially next monday . but girls who might want their parents to buy an angie doll to perhaps preside over a cabinet or barbies and kens will have to do some serious lobbying .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

" there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

" the hope that germany would be a shining european example for accelerated reforms has been dashed , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding . onward with reforms nevertheless , germany had already made significant progress in overhauling its economy and some of that process would still continue under a grand coalition . even deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter , who had gloomily proclaimed that germany could be on the verge of a new recession if the reform process ground to a halt , said there was some common ground for a grand coalition . " i 'm thinking of the reform of the federal system , but there could also be a common denominator in some areas in pension provisions and labor market policy that could enable small reforms to be pushed through , " walter said . stability important a grand coalition , in which the economy ministry will be headed by bavaria 's conservative leader edmund stoiber , could indeed prove more stable than some of the other groupings mooted in recent weeks , such as a three-way alliance between merkel 's cdu , the pro-business liberal fdp and the environmentalist green party , analysts said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zimmermann " federalism reform can only happen in a grand coalition .
cleaning up the budget and simplifying the tax system are other areas that could be tackled , " said the head of the berlin-based economic research institute diw , klaus zimmermann , recently . under the german parliamentary system , opposition parties tend to build a majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , putting them in a position to block key government legislation . with a grand coalition holding the majority in both the lower and upper parliamentary houses , such political stalemate , at least on matters of tax , budget and the federal system , can be avoided . sticky labor market issue the one area that the two sides may not be able to agree on is labor market reforms . merkel had vowed to slash labor costs , ease rules on hiring and firing and allow companies to opt out of collective wage bargaining and tailor wage deals to their own particular economic situation . the spd , which shifted to the left in the election campaign in response to voters ' anger at its own social reforms , is likely to resist such proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition nevertheless , all in all , a government of both spd and cdu may not be the major step backward that the markets had initially feared , and while the reform process may be slowed , it is unlikely to be abandoned altogether , analysts said . hans-werner sinn , head of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo , saw a number of advantages in a grand coalition , such as the consolidation of public spending . but most of all , the cdu and spd parties would jointly have more strength to prescribe " the necessary medicine " than they would individually , sinn said .
" a stable government is good for the economy , " he said . another think tank , iw , said it expected the new government to continue a " moderate " course of reform that would pave the way for stronger growth next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election limbo raises industry fears german business leaders , disappointed by sunday 's election results , fear the next german government , in whatever form it may take , will not be strong enough to push through the reforms needed to boost the ailing economy .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "
but " what if it 's not her ? " the paper asked .
the social democrats may have counted on merkel being a weak chancellor who would make it easier for them during the next elections .
but their calculation is wrong , the daily commented .

the half-year results for 2005 seem quietly optimistic , " abraham said .

but it 's not a done deal until the bundestag votes her in .
dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .
helmut schmidt and helmut kohl each received only one vote more than necessary when they were elected chancellor in 1974 and 1982 respectively .
gerhard schröder got 305 votes in 2002 , just three more than he needed to be named chancellor .
minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .
if he dissolves parliament , new elections must take place within 60 days . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .
she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .
the two parties are more comfortable in their role as rivals , and there is concern that they will be unable to work together for the good of the country . merkel as policy-maker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel merkel 's ability to steer the government 's course has been called into question by both sides .
spd party leader franz müntefering said that , in such a coalition , the chancellor 's duty to make policy is " not viable . "
were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .
in those goals , and in new challenges that would arise , merkel would have a " leadership function that she will exercise . " finding common ground andreas wuest , political scientist from mannheim university , said the parties must now smooth over their differences . " it is not easy , they have to find agreement on their policies , " wuest told afp .
" but angela merkel may still be a successful chancellor , there is nothing to say that it can not last for a few years . " for a start , he said , they agree sufficiently to allow them to work together to reduce rampant unemployment , which at more than 11 percent , is perhaps the worst of germany 's ills . " i do not see a problem moving forward to tackle unemployment , " wuest said .
" the parties may not manage to agree on labor reforms that affect people in jobs , but they will try and do something about the jobless . " helping matters further for the new coalition , wuest said , is the fact that , as schröder began to introduce controversial reforms of the labor market , he was " moving very much in the direction the christian democrats wanted him to go for a long time . " he predicted that the first change the new coalition would make would be to strengthen federalism to give the country 's 16 states more power to act independently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor dr. norbert walter , chief economist of deutsche bank deutsche bank chief economist , norbert walter , agreed that there was common ground for left-right cohabitation .

the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .
she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .
the two parties are more comfortable in their role as rivals , and there is concern that they will be unable to work together for the good of the country . merkel as policy-maker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel merkel 's ability to steer the government 's course has been called into question by both sides .
spd party leader franz müntefering said that , in such a coalition , the chancellor 's duty to make policy is " not viable . "
were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .
in those goals , and in new challenges that would arise , merkel would have a " leadership function that she will exercise . " finding common ground andreas wuest , political scientist from mannheim university , said the parties must now smooth over their differences . " it is not easy , they have to find agreement on their policies , " wuest told afp .
" but angela merkel may still be a successful chancellor , there is nothing to say that it can not last for a few years . " for a start , he said , they agree sufficiently to allow them to work together to reduce rampant unemployment , which at more than 11 percent , is perhaps the worst of germany 's ills . " i do not see a problem moving forward to tackle unemployment , " wuest said .
" the parties may not manage to agree on labor reforms that affect people in jobs , but they will try and do something about the jobless . " helping matters further for the new coalition , wuest said , is the fact that , as schröder began to introduce controversial reforms of the labor market , he was " moving very much in the direction the christian democrats wanted him to go for a long time . " he predicted that the first change the new coalition would make would be to strengthen federalism to give the country 's 16 states more power to act independently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor dr. norbert walter , chief economist of deutsche bank deutsche bank chief economist , norbert walter , agreed that there was common ground for left-right cohabitation . " i 'm thinking of reform of the federal system , but there could also be a common denominator in some areas in pension provisions and labor market policy that could enable small reforms to be pushed through , " walter said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "
but " what if it 's not her ? " the paper asked .
the social democrats may have counted on merkel being a weak chancellor who would make it easier for them during the next elections .
but their calculation is wrong , the daily commented .
if the grand coalition is n't successful , the spd will be held accountable too . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

" the hope that germany would be a shining european example for accelerated reforms has been dashed , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding . onward with reforms nevertheless , germany had already made significant progress in overhauling its economy and some of that process would still continue under a grand coalition . even deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter , who had gloomily proclaimed that germany could be on the verge of a new recession if the reform process ground to a halt , said there was some common ground for a grand coalition .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .

' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "
but " what if it 's not her ? " the paper asked .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

girls who want that role model will have to get the new angela merkel doll . not everyone is deemed worthy of getting his or her own likeness in a doll , but doll maker marcel offermann thought the fact that angela merkel will be germany 's first female chancellor was worth putting his skills to work . it almost did n't happen , just as there was some doubt as to whether merkel would actually enter the history books as the first woman to make it to the very top of german politics .

she will be following in the exalted footsteps of other offermann creations such as the dalai lama and pope benedict xvi . angie the doll wo n't exactly be all dolled up in her plastic form .
she 'll be wearing simple , dark blue pants and a lavender t-shirt and will have a hair-do that 's pretty close to the coif she has in real life .
according to offermann , the future chancellor has a " unique style " that was not difficult to translate into doll form .
she 'll be unveiled officially next monday . but girls who might want their parents to buy an angie doll to perhaps preside over a cabinet or barbies and kens will have to do some serious lobbying .

it was there that , almost exactly 50 years ago , the bundeswehr was created .
despite germans ' initial postwar ambivalence toward a national armed forces , half a century later , the bundeswehr is a success story , said german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler " for five decades , the bundeswehr has been invaluable in its service to the freedom and security of the federal republic of germany , " köhler said . in his speech before gathered officials marking the bundeswehr 's 40th " commander 's congress , " köhler credited the deterrent effect of the german armed forces with having been an important condition for the end of the cold war . " never before had military might achieved so much , so peacefully , " he said . köhler spoke of the many successes of the bundeswehr , such as the incorporation of east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- after reunification as well as various foreign missions .
in the past 13 years , more than 150,000 german soldiers have served on foreign territory . " the bundeswehr has gained much recognition and respect for itself and for germany during its missions abroad , because our soldiers treat people of other nations and other cultures with respect , " köhler said . solid concept needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the german president had more than praise on his mind .
he appealed to german politicians to grant the bundeswehr not just a solid financial situation and better equipment for its foreign missions , but also a clear concept for its future role . " we need an active , not a reactive , foreign , security and defense policy - one that thinks in terms of its own interests , and not just institutional mechanisms , " köhler said . but a definition of german interests - the question of when , and for what reasons , german soldiers should risk their lives overseas and when they should end their missions - is still lacking . " the bundeswehr will be restructured , away from a self-defense force , but toward what ?
a deployment army ?
an interventionist force ? "
köhler asked .

any slip up could mean further derision for klinsmann 's men . germany have hit a wall of criticism in their build-up for the 2006 world cup on home soil and know the knives will be sharpened again should they fail to swat aside china in wednesday 's friendly in hamburg . after a positive 2005 confederations cup , when they reached the semi-finals , germany looked to be on the up but a 2-1 reverse in turkey on saturday represented another setback . " i had too much to do in that game and expect an improvement , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we are being criticized and deservedly so .
but we should not panic and just make sure we turn in a good performance against china . " a 2-0 defeat in slovakia and flattering 2-2 draw with the netherlands has persuaded the media to laugh off claims from jürgen klinsmann that lifting the world cup is realistic . " the criticism we are receiving is fair but we should not hide from it , " declared klinsmann .
" our aim to become world champions has not changed despite recent results . " kaiser criticizes klinsi 's transatlantic lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup winners beckenbauer and klinsmann are at odds over the best way to regain the trophy germany 's performances of late have not been the only fuel for the fire .
west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer has called for klinsmann to spend more time in his homeland ahead of the 2006 world cup finals . klinsmann has resided in the united states since taking charge in july 2004 , often jetting back to his californian home after matches , but beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , feels that can not continue in the build-up to the finals . " in the world cup year he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- should spend more time in germany than the united states , " declared beckenbauer .
" that way he would avoid constant criticism that he is never here . " klinsmann has maintained that he can get a different perspective by living outside of germany but the poor recent results have increased the pressure . " the criticism that has surfaced now is an indication of what it will be like next year , " added beckenbauer .
" a world cup is never easy for any manager . " ballack to miss china clash as pressure increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a result against the likes of china on wednesday may hold off the criticism for a while but germany have to improve .
they face the chinese without bayern munich star michael ballack who will be missing again with the flu but even without their captain germany are expected to see off china at the aol-arena . the warm-up game has an added twist in that sv hamburg will net the match proceeds - expected to reach 1.5 million euros - as compensation for the robert hoyer match-fixing scandal .
in january tainted referee hoyzer admitted to rigging sc paderborn 's 4-2 shock cup victory over hamburg in august 2004 . germany will want to ensure that the underdogs do not come away with a win on wednesday evening and fc cologne striker lukas podolski insists china would not be underestimated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 11.10.2005 grand coalition a delicate balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all about concentration and cooperation - can politicians do it ?
the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .
she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .
the two parties are more comfortable in their role as rivals , and there is concern that they will be unable to work together for the good of the country . merkel as policy-maker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel merkel 's ability to steer the government 's course has been called into question by both sides .
spd party leader franz müntefering said that , in such a coalition , the chancellor 's duty to make policy is " not viable . "
were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .
in those goals , and in new challenges that would arise , merkel would have a " leadership function that she will exercise . " finding common ground andreas wuest , political scientist from mannheim university , said the parties must now smooth over their differences . " it is not easy , they have to find agreement on their policies , " wuest told afp .
" but angela merkel may still be a successful chancellor , there is nothing to say that it can not last for a few years . " for a start , he said , they agree sufficiently to allow them to work together to reduce rampant unemployment , which at more than 11 percent , is perhaps the worst of germany 's ills . " i do not see a problem moving forward to tackle unemployment , " wuest said .
" the parties may not manage to agree on labor reforms that affect people in jobs , but they will try and do something about the jobless . " helping matters further for the new coalition , wuest said , is the fact that , as schröder began to introduce controversial reforms of the labor market , he was " moving very much in the direction the christian democrats wanted him to go for a long time . " he predicted that the first change the new coalition would make would be to strengthen federalism to give the country 's 16 states more power to act independently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor dr. norbert walter , chief economist of deutsche bank deutsche bank chief economist , norbert walter , agreed that there was common ground for left-right cohabitation . " i 'm thinking of reform of the federal system , but there could also be a common denominator in some areas in pension provisions and labor market policy that could enable small reforms to be pushed through , " walter said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

girls who want that role model will have to get the new angela merkel doll . not everyone is deemed worthy of getting his or her own likeness in a doll , but doll maker marcel offermann thought the fact that angela merkel will be germany 's first female chancellor was worth putting his skills to work . it almost did n't happen , just as there was some doubt as to whether merkel would actually enter the history books as the first woman to make it to the very top of german politics .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann .

any slip up could mean further derision for klinsmann 's men . germany have hit a wall of criticism in their build-up for the 2006 world cup on home soil and know the knives will be sharpened again should they fail to swat aside china in wednesday 's friendly in hamburg . after a positive 2005 confederations cup , when they reached the semi-finals , germany looked to be on the up but a 2-1 reverse in turkey on saturday represented another setback . " i had too much to do in that game and expect an improvement , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we are being criticized and deservedly so .
but we should not panic and just make sure we turn in a good performance against china . " a 2-0 defeat in slovakia and flattering 2-2 draw with the netherlands has persuaded the media to laugh off claims from jürgen klinsmann that lifting the world cup is realistic . " the criticism we are receiving is fair but we should not hide from it , " declared klinsmann .
" our aim to become world champions has not changed despite recent results . " kaiser criticizes klinsi 's transatlantic lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup winners beckenbauer and klinsmann are at odds over the best way to regain the trophy germany 's performances of late have not been the only fuel for the fire .
west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer has called for klinsmann to spend more time in his homeland ahead of the 2006 world cup finals . klinsmann has resided in the united states since taking charge in july 2004 , often jetting back to his californian home after matches , but beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , feels that can not continue in the build-up to the finals . " in the world cup year he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- should spend more time in germany than the united states , " declared beckenbauer .
" that way he would avoid constant criticism that he is never here . " klinsmann has maintained that he can get a different perspective by living outside of germany but the poor recent results have increased the pressure . " the criticism that has surfaced now is an indication of what it will be like next year , " added beckenbauer .
" a world cup is never easy for any manager . " ballack to miss china clash as pressure increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a result against the likes of china on wednesday may hold off the criticism for a while but germany have to improve .
they face the chinese without bayern munich star michael ballack who will be missing again with the flu but even without their captain germany are expected to see off china at the aol-arena . the warm-up game has an added twist in that sv hamburg will net the match proceeds - expected to reach 1.5 million euros - as compensation for the robert hoyer match-fixing scandal .
in january tainted referee hoyzer admitted to rigging sc paderborn 's 4-2 shock cup victory over hamburg in august 2004 . germany will want to ensure that the underdogs do not come away with a win on wednesday evening and fc cologne striker lukas podolski insists china would not be underestimated .
" we need to play at 100 percent in every game whether we are facing china , liechtenstein or brazil , " stated podolski . chinese would love a big scalp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soccer fans beat drums prior to start of 2002 world cup group c soccer match between china and costa rica , gwangju world cup stadium , south korea , photo having failed to qualify for the 2006 world cup china 's next big challenge is the 2008 olympic games in peking . two chinese stars of the english premiership - everton 's li tie and manchester city 's sun jihai - are two of the big players in the china set-up and manager zhu guanghu admits his team will play on the counter attack .

any slip up could mean further derision for klinsmann 's men . germany have hit a wall of criticism in their build-up for the 2006 world cup on home soil and know the knives will be sharpened again should they fail to swat aside china in wednesday 's friendly in hamburg . after a positive 2005 confederations cup , when they reached the semi-finals , germany looked to be on the up but a 2-1 reverse in turkey on saturday represented another setback . " i had too much to do in that game and expect an improvement , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we are being criticized and deservedly so .
but we should not panic and just make sure we turn in a good performance against china . " a 2-0 defeat in slovakia and flattering 2-2 draw with the netherlands has persuaded the media to laugh off claims from jürgen klinsmann that lifting the world cup is realistic . " the criticism we are receiving is fair but we should not hide from it , " declared klinsmann .
" our aim to become world champions has not changed despite recent results . " kaiser criticizes klinsi 's transatlantic lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup winners beckenbauer and klinsmann are at odds over the best way to regain the trophy germany 's performances of late have not been the only fuel for the fire .
west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer has called for klinsmann to spend more time in his homeland ahead of the 2006 world cup finals . klinsmann has resided in the united states since taking charge in july 2004 , often jetting back to his californian home after matches , but beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , feels that can not continue in the build-up to the finals . " in the world cup year he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- should spend more time in germany than the united states , " declared beckenbauer .
" that way he would avoid constant criticism that he is never here . " klinsmann has maintained that he can get a different perspective by living outside of germany but the poor recent results have increased the pressure . " the criticism that has surfaced now is an indication of what it will be like next year , " added beckenbauer .
" a world cup is never easy for any manager . " ballack to miss china clash as pressure increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a result against the likes of china on wednesday may hold off the criticism for a while but germany have to improve .
they face the chinese without bayern munich star michael ballack who will be missing again with the flu but even without their captain germany are expected to see off china at the aol-arena . the warm-up game has an added twist in that sv hamburg will net the match proceeds - expected to reach 1.5 million euros - as compensation for the robert hoyer match-fixing scandal .
in january tainted referee hoyzer admitted to rigging sc paderborn 's 4-2 shock cup victory over hamburg in august 2004 . germany will want to ensure that the underdogs do not come away with a win on wednesday evening and fc cologne striker lukas podolski insists china would not be underestimated .
" we need to play at 100 percent in every game whether we are facing china , liechtenstein or brazil , " stated podolski . chinese would love a big scalp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soccer fans beat drums prior to start of 2002 world cup group c soccer match between china and costa rica , gwangju world cup stadium , south korea , photo having failed to qualify for the 2006 world cup china 's next big challenge is the 2008 olympic games in peking . two chinese stars of the english premiership - everton 's li tie and manchester city 's sun jihai - are two of the big players in the china set-up and manager zhu guanghu admits his team will play on the counter attack .

" the hope that germany would be a shining european example for accelerated reforms has been dashed , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding . onward with reforms nevertheless , germany had already made significant progress in overhauling its economy and some of that process would still continue under a grand coalition . even deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter , who had gloomily proclaimed that germany could be on the verge of a new recession if the reform process ground to a halt , said there was some common ground for a grand coalition . " i 'm thinking of the reform of the federal system , but there could also be a common denominator in some areas in pension provisions and labor market policy that could enable small reforms to be pushed through , " walter said . stability important a grand coalition , in which the economy ministry will be headed by bavaria 's conservative leader edmund stoiber , could indeed prove more stable than some of the other groupings mooted in recent weeks , such as a three-way alliance between merkel 's cdu , the pro-business liberal fdp and the environmentalist green party , analysts said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zimmermann " federalism reform can only happen in a grand coalition .
cleaning up the budget and simplifying the tax system are other areas that could be tackled , " said the head of the berlin-based economic research institute diw , klaus zimmermann , recently . under the german parliamentary system , opposition parties tend to build a majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , putting them in a position to block key government legislation . with a grand coalition holding the majority in both the lower and upper parliamentary houses , such political stalemate , at least on matters of tax , budget and the federal system , can be avoided . sticky labor market issue the one area that the two sides may not be able to agree on is labor market reforms . merkel had vowed to slash labor costs , ease rules on hiring and firing and allow companies to opt out of collective wage bargaining and tailor wage deals to their own particular economic situation . the spd , which shifted to the left in the election campaign in response to voters ' anger at its own social reforms , is likely to resist such proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition nevertheless , all in all , a government of both spd and cdu may not be the major step backward that the markets had initially feared , and while the reform process may be slowed , it is unlikely to be abandoned altogether , analysts said . hans-werner sinn , head of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo , saw a number of advantages in a grand coalition , such as the consolidation of public spending . but most of all , the cdu and spd parties would jointly have more strength to prescribe " the necessary medicine " than they would individually , sinn said .
" a stable government is good for the economy , " he said . another think tank , iw , said it expected the new government to continue a " moderate " course of reform that would pave the way for stronger growth next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election limbo raises industry fears german business leaders , disappointed by sunday 's election results , fear the next german government , in whatever form it may take , will not be strong enough to push through the reforms needed to boost the ailing economy .

it was there that , almost exactly 50 years ago , the bundeswehr was created .
despite germans ' initial postwar ambivalence toward a national armed forces , half a century later , the bundeswehr is a success story , said german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler " for five decades , the bundeswehr has been invaluable in its service to the freedom and security of the federal republic of germany , " köhler said . in his speech before gathered officials marking the bundeswehr 's 40th " commander 's congress , " köhler credited the deterrent effect of the german armed forces with having been an important condition for the end of the cold war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.10.2005 experts hope merkel gets germany working großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a work in progress : analysts hope germany 's reforms will get a boost angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday . a stable government of social democrat spd and christian union cdu / csu parties might be able to push through at least some of the key reforms needed to get the euro-zone 's biggest economy back on its feet , they say . and financial markets , which were initially wary about the prospect of a grand coalition , also appear to be coming round to the idea that a left-right administration might not be so bad as first appeared . amid market perceptions that the reform process , which experts say it crucial for economic growth , would come to a halt , both the german stock markets and the euro fell in the first days following the election . but three weeks later , the blue-chip dax 30 index is back at its highest level in around three and a half years and business confidence is on the rise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a result , economists are warming to the prospect of a new government which , while it might not necessarily agree on how to reform the labor market , may well be in a position to shake up the country 's federal system , simplify the tax system and get its public finances in order . " the hope that germany would be a shining european example for accelerated reforms has been dashed , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding . onward with reforms nevertheless , germany had already made significant progress in overhauling its economy and some of that process would still continue under a grand coalition . even deutsche bank chief economist norbert walter , who had gloomily proclaimed that germany could be on the verge of a new recession if the reform process ground to a halt , said there was some common ground for a grand coalition . " i 'm thinking of the reform of the federal system , but there could also be a common denominator in some areas in pension provisions and labor market policy that could enable small reforms to be pushed through , " walter said . stability important a grand coalition , in which the economy ministry will be headed by bavaria 's conservative leader edmund stoiber , could indeed prove more stable than some of the other groupings mooted in recent weeks , such as a three-way alliance between merkel 's cdu , the pro-business liberal fdp and the environmentalist green party , analysts said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zimmermann " federalism reform can only happen in a grand coalition .
cleaning up the budget and simplifying the tax system are other areas that could be tackled , " said the head of the berlin-based economic research institute diw , klaus zimmermann , recently . under the german parliamentary system , opposition parties tend to build a majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , putting them in a position to block key government legislation . with a grand coalition holding the majority in both the lower and upper parliamentary houses , such political stalemate , at least on matters of tax , budget and the federal system , can be avoided . sticky labor market issue the one area that the two sides may not be able to agree on is labor market reforms . merkel had vowed to slash labor costs , ease rules on hiring and firing and allow companies to opt out of collective wage bargaining and tailor wage deals to their own particular economic situation . the spd , which shifted to the left in the election campaign in response to voters ' anger at its own social reforms , is likely to resist such proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition nevertheless , all in all , a government of both spd and cdu may not be the major step backward that the markets had initially feared , and while the reform process may be slowed , it is unlikely to be abandoned altogether , analysts said . hans-werner sinn , head of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo , saw a number of advantages in a grand coalition , such as the consolidation of public spending . but most of all , the cdu and spd parties would jointly have more strength to prescribe " the necessary medicine " than they would individually , sinn said .
" a stable government is good for the economy , " he said . another think tank , iw , said it expected the new government to continue a " moderate " course of reform that would pave the way for stronger growth next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election limbo raises industry fears german business leaders , disappointed by sunday 's election results , fear the next german government , in whatever form it may take , will not be strong enough to push through the reforms needed to boost the ailing economy .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "
but " what if it 's not her ? " the paper asked .
the social democrats may have counted on merkel being a weak chancellor who would make it easier for them during the next elections .
but their calculation is wrong , the daily commented .
if the grand coalition is n't successful , the spd will be held accountable too . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .

the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .
she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .
the two parties are more comfortable in their role as rivals , and there is concern that they will be unable to work together for the good of the country . merkel as policy-maker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel merkel 's ability to steer the government 's course has been called into question by both sides .
spd party leader franz müntefering said that , in such a coalition , the chancellor 's duty to make policy is " not viable . "
were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .
in those goals , and in new challenges that would arise , merkel would have a " leadership function that she will exercise . " finding common ground andreas wuest , political scientist from mannheim university , said the parties must now smooth over their differences . " it is not easy , they have to find agreement on their policies , " wuest told afp .
" but angela merkel may still be a successful chancellor , there is nothing to say that it can not last for a few years . " for a start , he said , they agree sufficiently to allow them to work together to reduce rampant unemployment , which at more than 11 percent , is perhaps the worst of germany 's ills . " i do not see a problem moving forward to tackle unemployment , " wuest said .
" the parties may not manage to agree on labor reforms that affect people in jobs , but they will try and do something about the jobless . " helping matters further for the new coalition , wuest said , is the fact that , as schröder began to introduce controversial reforms of the labor market , he was " moving very much in the direction the christian democrats wanted him to go for a long time . " he predicted that the first change the new coalition would make would be to strengthen federalism to give the country 's 16 states more power to act independently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor dr. norbert walter , chief economist of deutsche bank deutsche bank chief economist , norbert walter , agreed that there was common ground for left-right cohabitation . " i 'm thinking of reform of the federal system , but there could also be a common denominator in some areas in pension provisions and labor market policy that could enable small reforms to be pushed through , " walter said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

it was there that , almost exactly 50 years ago , the bundeswehr was created .
despite germans ' initial postwar ambivalence toward a national armed forces , half a century later , the bundeswehr is a success story , said german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler " for five decades , the bundeswehr has been invaluable in its service to the freedom and security of the federal republic of germany , " köhler said . in his speech before gathered officials marking the bundeswehr 's 40th " commander 's congress , " köhler credited the deterrent effect of the german armed forces with having been an important condition for the end of the cold war . " never before had military might achieved so much , so peacefully , " he said . köhler spoke of the many successes of the bundeswehr , such as the incorporation of east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- after reunification as well as various foreign missions .
in the past 13 years , more than 150,000 german soldiers have served on foreign territory . " the bundeswehr has gained much recognition and respect for itself and for germany during its missions abroad , because our soldiers treat people of other nations and other cultures with respect , " köhler said . solid concept needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the german president had more than praise on his mind .
he appealed to german politicians to grant the bundeswehr not just a solid financial situation and better equipment for its foreign missions , but also a clear concept for its future role . " we need an active , not a reactive , foreign , security and defense policy - one that thinks in terms of its own interests , and not just institutional mechanisms , " köhler said . but a definition of german interests - the question of when , and for what reasons , german soldiers should risk their lives overseas and when they should end their missions - is still lacking . " the bundeswehr will be restructured , away from a self-defense force , but toward what ?
a deployment army ?
an interventionist force ? "
köhler asked .
" the german parliament has approved the foreign deployment of german soldiers more than 40 times , but that does n't appear to resonate much with germans . " future of conscription bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits during basic training since 1957 , the bundeswehr has relied on obligatory military service for civilians , a system that lent the armed forces the ability to mobilize big reserves in a short time .
but that 's an ability that has largely become obsolete with the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , köhler is in favor of maintaining conscription . " i 'm convinced of the merits of military service , and it 's my wish that the system will have a future , " said köhler .
" it leads many qualified people to the bundeswehr ; it keeps our forces rooted in the nation ; and it has a beneficial effect on our common character . " although many military experts have long demanded that germany join the ranks of other european nations that have switched to a professional army , the future of military service now appears to be secure in the medium term .
under the new grand coalition , both of the parties making up the next government have for years been firm supporters of military service . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how two armies became one the reunification of germany in 1990 not only meant the unity of political entities .

but it 's not a done deal until the bundestag votes her in .
dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .
helmut schmidt and helmut kohl each received only one vote more than necessary when they were elected chancellor in 1974 and 1982 respectively .
gerhard schröder got 305 votes in 2002 , just three more than he needed to be named chancellor .
minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .
if he dissolves parliament , new elections must take place within 60 days . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .

spd party leader franz müntefering said that , in such a coalition , the chancellor 's duty to make policy is " not viable . "
were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .

but it 's not a done deal until the bundestag votes her in .
dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .
helmut schmidt and helmut kohl each received only one vote more than necessary when they were elected chancellor in 1974 and 1982 respectively .
gerhard schröder got 305 votes in 2002 , just three more than he needed to be named chancellor .
minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .
if he dissolves parliament , new elections must take place within 60 days . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

but healthy and frozen foods continue to capture public attention . the anuga trade fair is open to the trade only , but a wide variety of visitors from around the world make the biennial pilgrimmage to cologne to catch up on the latest trends and developments in food , be it organic , frozen , or gourmet . after a few years of falling exhibitor numbers , the fair is back on a growth track , said cologne trade fair chief wolfgang kranz .
with 63,000 exhibitors , there are 4.7 percent more companies showing their wares this year than two years ago .
also , the field has clearly become more international , with 108 countries represented this year , up from 90 two years ago , kranz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morocco is one of 108 countreis represented a clear trend in germany is the growth in demand for frozen foods .

" in general , you can say that the industry is seeing more light than shadow at the moment .
it is slowly getting better - but it is really hard to see a strong growth trend in the hotel and gastronomy sectors , " ehler said . " the opportunities for growth in the moment are particularly visible in hotels that specialize in conferences and wellness , and in city hotels . " but if times are not very easy for the german food industry , optimists still abound .
a growth trend can be definitely seen in the health foods sector , said jürgen abraham of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve . -rrb-

" on the german market , the industry has long been fighting resistance by consumers , and is looking for ways to get over this focus on prices .
the half-year results for 2005 seem quietly optimistic , " abraham said .
overall sales reached 65 billion euros , up 2.4 percent from a year earlier .

schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "
but " what if it 's not her ? " the paper asked .
the social democrats may have counted on merkel being a weak chancellor who would make it easier for them during the next elections .

the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .
she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .
the two parties are more comfortable in their role as rivals , and there is concern that they will be unable to work together for the good of the country . merkel as policy-maker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel merkel 's ability to steer the government 's course has been called into question by both sides .
spd party leader franz müntefering said that , in such a coalition , the chancellor 's duty to make policy is " not viable . "
were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .
in those goals , and in new challenges that would arise , merkel would have a " leadership function that she will exercise . " finding common ground andreas wuest , political scientist from mannheim university , said the parties must now smooth over their differences . " it is not easy , they have to find agreement on their policies , " wuest told afp .
" but angela merkel may still be a successful chancellor , there is nothing to say that it can not last for a few years . " for a start , he said , they agree sufficiently to allow them to work together to reduce rampant unemployment , which at more than 11 percent , is perhaps the worst of germany 's ills . " i do not see a problem moving forward to tackle unemployment , " wuest said .
" the parties may not manage to agree on labor reforms that affect people in jobs , but they will try and do something about the jobless . " helping matters further for the new coalition , wuest said , is the fact that , as schröder began to introduce controversial reforms of the labor market , he was " moving very much in the direction the christian democrats wanted him to go for a long time . " he predicted that the first change the new coalition would make would be to strengthen federalism to give the country 's 16 states more power to act independently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor dr. norbert walter , chief economist of deutsche bank deutsche bank chief economist , norbert walter , agreed that there was common ground for left-right cohabitation . " i 'm thinking of reform of the federal system , but there could also be a common denominator in some areas in pension provisions and labor market policy that could enable small reforms to be pushed through , " walter said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "

any slip up could mean further derision for klinsmann 's men . germany have hit a wall of criticism in their build-up for the 2006 world cup on home soil and know the knives will be sharpened again should they fail to swat aside china in wednesday 's friendly in hamburg . after a positive 2005 confederations cup , when they reached the semi-finals , germany looked to be on the up but a 2-1 reverse in turkey on saturday represented another setback . " i had too much to do in that game and expect an improvement , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we are being criticized and deservedly so .
but we should not panic and just make sure we turn in a good performance against china . " a 2-0 defeat in slovakia and flattering 2-2 draw with the netherlands has persuaded the media to laugh off claims from jürgen klinsmann that lifting the world cup is realistic . " the criticism we are receiving is fair but we should not hide from it , " declared klinsmann .
" our aim to become world champions has not changed despite recent results . " kaiser criticizes klinsi 's transatlantic lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup winners beckenbauer and klinsmann are at odds over the best way to regain the trophy germany 's performances of late have not been the only fuel for the fire .
west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer has called for klinsmann to spend more time in his homeland ahead of the 2006 world cup finals . klinsmann has resided in the united states since taking charge in july 2004 , often jetting back to his californian home after matches , but beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , feels that can not continue in the build-up to the finals . " in the world cup year he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- should spend more time in germany than the united states , " declared beckenbauer .
" that way he would avoid constant criticism that he is never here . " klinsmann has maintained that he can get a different perspective by living outside of germany but the poor recent results have increased the pressure . " the criticism that has surfaced now is an indication of what it will be like next year , " added beckenbauer .
" a world cup is never easy for any manager . " ballack to miss china clash as pressure increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a result against the likes of china on wednesday may hold off the criticism for a while but germany have to improve .
they face the chinese without bayern munich star michael ballack who will be missing again with the flu but even without their captain germany are expected to see off china at the aol-arena . the warm-up game has an added twist in that sv hamburg will net the match proceeds - expected to reach 1.5 million euros - as compensation for the robert hoyer match-fixing scandal .
in january tainted referee hoyzer admitted to rigging sc paderborn 's 4-2 shock cup victory over hamburg in august 2004 . germany will want to ensure that the underdogs do not come away with a win on wednesday evening and fc cologne striker lukas podolski insists china would not be underestimated .
" we need to play at 100 percent in every game whether we are facing china , liechtenstein or brazil , " stated podolski . chinese would love a big scalp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soccer fans beat drums prior to start of 2002 world cup group c soccer match between china and costa rica , gwangju world cup stadium , south korea , photo having failed to qualify for the 2006 world cup china 's next big challenge is the 2008 olympic games in peking . two chinese stars of the english premiership - everton 's li tie and manchester city 's sun jihai - are two of the big players in the china set-up and manager zhu guanghu admits his team will play on the counter attack .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .

" tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "
but " what if it 's not her ? " the paper asked .
the social democrats may have counted on merkel being a weak chancellor who would make it easier for them during the next elections .
but their calculation is wrong , the daily commented .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "
but " what if it 's not her ? " the paper asked .
the social democrats may have counted on merkel being a weak chancellor who would make it easier for them during the next elections .

the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .
she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .
the two parties are more comfortable in their role as rivals , and there is concern that they will be unable to work together for the good of the country . merkel as policy-maker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel merkel 's ability to steer the government 's course has been called into question by both sides .
spd party leader franz müntefering said that , in such a coalition , the chancellor 's duty to make policy is " not viable . "
were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .
in those goals , and in new challenges that would arise , merkel would have a " leadership function that she will exercise . " finding common ground andreas wuest , political scientist from mannheim university , said the parties must now smooth over their differences . " it is not easy , they have to find agreement on their policies , " wuest told afp .
" but angela merkel may still be a successful chancellor , there is nothing to say that it can not last for a few years . " for a start , he said , they agree sufficiently to allow them to work together to reduce rampant unemployment , which at more than 11 percent , is perhaps the worst of germany 's ills . " i do not see a problem moving forward to tackle unemployment , " wuest said .
" the parties may not manage to agree on labor reforms that affect people in jobs , but they will try and do something about the jobless . " helping matters further for the new coalition , wuest said , is the fact that , as schröder began to introduce controversial reforms of the labor market , he was " moving very much in the direction the christian democrats wanted him to go for a long time . " he predicted that the first change the new coalition would make would be to strengthen federalism to give the country 's 16 states more power to act independently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor dr. norbert walter , chief economist of deutsche bank deutsche bank chief economist , norbert walter , agreed that there was common ground for left-right cohabitation .

the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .
she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .
the two parties are more comfortable in their role as rivals , and there is concern that they will be unable to work together for the good of the country . merkel as policy-maker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel merkel 's ability to steer the government 's course has been called into question by both sides .
spd party leader franz müntefering said that , in such a coalition , the chancellor 's duty to make policy is " not viable . "
were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .
in those goals , and in new challenges that would arise , merkel would have a " leadership function that she will exercise .

but it 's not a done deal until the bundestag votes her in .
dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .
helmut schmidt and helmut kohl each received only one vote more than necessary when they were elected chancellor in 1974 and 1982 respectively .
gerhard schröder got 305 votes in 2002 , just three more than he needed to be named chancellor .
minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .
if he dissolves parliament , new elections must take place within 60 days . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .

over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 11.10.2005 knives sharpened ahead of china friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's fanatical support will be screaming for a german debacle germany 's under-fire soccer stars will be under intense scrutiny when china arrive in hamburg on wednesday for a friendly match .
any slip up could mean further derision for klinsmann 's men . germany have hit a wall of criticism in their build-up for the 2006 world cup on home soil and know the knives will be sharpened again should they fail to swat aside china in wednesday 's friendly in hamburg . after a positive 2005 confederations cup , when they reached the semi-finals , germany looked to be on the up but a 2-1 reverse in turkey on saturday represented another setback . " i had too much to do in that game and expect an improvement , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we are being criticized and deservedly so .
but we should not panic and just make sure we turn in a good performance against china . " a 2-0 defeat in slovakia and flattering 2-2 draw with the netherlands has persuaded the media to laugh off claims from jürgen klinsmann that lifting the world cup is realistic . " the criticism we are receiving is fair but we should not hide from it , " declared klinsmann .
" our aim to become world champions has not changed despite recent results . " kaiser criticizes klinsi 's transatlantic lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup winners beckenbauer and klinsmann are at odds over the best way to regain the trophy germany 's performances of late have not been the only fuel for the fire .
west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer has called for klinsmann to spend more time in his homeland ahead of the 2006 world cup finals . klinsmann has resided in the united states since taking charge in july 2004 , often jetting back to his californian home after matches , but beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , feels that can not continue in the build-up to the finals . " in the world cup year he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- should spend more time in germany than the united states , " declared beckenbauer .
" that way he would avoid constant criticism that he is never here . " klinsmann has maintained that he can get a different perspective by living outside of germany but the poor recent results have increased the pressure . " the criticism that has surfaced now is an indication of what it will be like next year , " added beckenbauer .
" a world cup is never easy for any manager . " ballack to miss china clash as pressure increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a result against the likes of china on wednesday may hold off the criticism for a while but germany have to improve .
they face the chinese without bayern munich star michael ballack who will be missing again with the flu but even without their captain germany are expected to see off china at the aol-arena . the warm-up game has an added twist in that sv hamburg will net the match proceeds - expected to reach 1.5 million euros - as compensation for the robert hoyer match-fixing scandal .
in january tainted referee hoyzer admitted to rigging sc paderborn 's 4-2 shock cup victory over hamburg in august 2004 . germany will want to ensure that the underdogs do not come away with a win on wednesday evening and fc cologne striker lukas podolski insists china would not be underestimated .
" we need to play at 100 percent in every game whether we are facing china , liechtenstein or brazil , " stated podolski . chinese would love a big scalp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soccer fans beat drums prior to start of 2002 world cup group c soccer match between china and costa rica , gwangju world cup stadium , south korea , photo having failed to qualify for the 2006 world cup china 's next big challenge is the 2008 olympic games in peking . two chinese stars of the english premiership - everton 's li tie and manchester city 's sun jihai - are two of the big players in the china set-up and manager zhu guanghu admits his team will play on the counter attack .

it was there that , almost exactly 50 years ago , the bundeswehr was created .

in the past 13 years , more than 150,000 german soldiers have served on foreign territory .

" it leads many qualified people to the bundeswehr ; it keeps our forces rooted in the nation ; and it has a beneficial effect on our common character .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush grand coalition a delicate balancing act germany -pipe- 11.10.2005 the chancellor vote explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultimately , the bundestag will decide who will be chancellor the conservatives and social democrats may have agreed on angela merkel becoming the germany 's next chancellor .
but it 's not a done deal until the bundestag votes her in .
dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .
helmut schmidt and helmut kohl each received only one vote more than necessary when they were elected chancellor in 1974 and 1982 respectively .
gerhard schröder got 305 votes in 2002 , just three more than he needed to be named chancellor .
minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .
if he dissolves parliament , new elections must take place within 60 days . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

but it 's not a done deal until the bundestag votes her in .
dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .
helmut schmidt and helmut kohl each received only one vote more than necessary when they were elected chancellor in 1974 and 1982 respectively .
gerhard schröder got 305 votes in 2002 , just three more than he needed to be named chancellor .
minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .
if he dissolves parliament , new elections must take place within 60 days . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities .

it was there that , almost exactly 50 years ago , the bundeswehr was created .
despite germans ' initial postwar ambivalence toward a national armed forces , half a century later , the bundeswehr is a success story , said german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler " for five decades , the bundeswehr has been invaluable in its service to the freedom and security of the federal republic of germany , " köhler said . in his speech before gathered officials marking the bundeswehr 's 40th " commander 's congress , " köhler credited the deterrent effect of the german armed forces with having been an important condition for the end of the cold war . " never before had military might achieved so much , so peacefully , " he said . köhler spoke of the many successes of the bundeswehr , such as the incorporation of east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- after reunification as well as various foreign missions .
in the past 13 years , more than 150,000 german soldiers have served on foreign territory .

" the bundeswehr will be restructured , away from a self-defense force , but toward what ?

despite this , köhler is in favor of maintaining conscription . " i 'm convinced of the merits of military service , and it 's my wish that the system will have a future , " said köhler .
" it leads many qualified people to the bundeswehr ; it keeps our forces rooted in the nation ; and it has a beneficial effect on our common character . " although many military experts have long demanded that germany join the ranks of other european nations that have switched to a professional army , the future of military service now appears to be secure in the medium term .

the patented invention was first presented at the leipzig trade fair in 1928 and according to a newspaper report at the time , was triggered by the death of a family , which was poisoned by a leak in a conventional refrigerator .
the einstein refrigerator is made of inexpensive , non-moving parts , operates silently -lrb- due to the absence of a motor or compressor -rrb- , and is very reliable .
however , it was never put into commercial production also patents were sold to companies such as electrolux of sweden . dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

germany 's merkel with poland 's donald tusk strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .
and all signs point toward a definite chill in the air between the two . poland 's recent swift and clear change in government has jarred sharply with germany 's electoral stalemate and ensuing coalition talks . poles voted in two center-right parties , the populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , which won the election , and their coalition partner the pro-market civil platform -lrb- po -rrb- . germans , on the other hand , delivered an ambivalent message with no party winning an outright majority .
the result has been a so-called " grand coalition " between the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , and the social democrats . though poles have yet to elect a president , there 's no question that political maneuverings in warsaw have indeed been much smoother than those in berlin .
but , that still has n't stopped some from fretting over the future course of warsaw 's foreign policy and in particular its relations with neighboring germany . " the german factor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spot the difference : lech and jaroslaw kaczynski signs thus far have n't been encouraging .
the center-right populist law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- , led by identical twins lech and jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- photo -rrb- , which won the parliamentary vote , adopted a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , pushing for a stronger role for poland in the eu and a weakening of franco-german dominance . the twins also took a tough line on germany and russia .
lech kaczynski , currently mayor of warsaw and who alarmed the eu earlier this year by banning a gay parade , has called the two countries " dangerous opponents , " while his brother jaroslaw said germany was less of a partner , but rather a threat . " what we 're seeing is a clear comeback of the ' german factor ' in poland .
that 's evident in the thinking and actions of the politicians , " said kai-olaf lang , poland expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" there 's definitely going to be a cooling of ties between the two countries . " dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt agreed . " the nationalist-populism of the kaczynski brothers can be interpreted as almost anti-german , " he said . a string of irritants at the same time experts point out that the current tough rhetoric in poland towards germany comes at a time when relations are n't the best anyway . " german-polish ties in the first 10 to 12 years following the fall of communism in 1989/90 were largely a successful reconciliation story on most counts - historically , politically and in a european context , " lang explained .
" but the model has entered a difficult phase in the last three to four years . " there have been many reasons . poland 's strong support of the us-led war in iraq in 2002 , the row over the eu constitution and german opposition to opening up its labor markets to polish workers have all soured bilateral relations . german plans to build a controversial center as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii has only served to worsen ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best of pals : putin and schröder and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin and the sealing of a controversial five-billion-dollar energy contract between the two to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , bypassing the baltic states and poland , to bring russian gas to germany has proved the final straw . poland last month slammed the deal as a political show of force by putin and a campaign tool by schröder . reconciliation on some fronts but , the impending shuffle in germany 's political leadership , experts say , might just remove some of the stumbling blocks . " a grand coalition in germany is a big chance for german-polish relations because the social democrats who will have the foreign ministry portfolio , do n't support the controversial center for wartime expulsions , " cornelius ochmann , an expert on eastern europe at the bertelsmann foundation . but others point out that it wo n't be as easy to undo the damage done by the russo-german gas pipeline deal . " that 's going to continue to be a sticking point between the two .
in poland the deal is seen as a defeat both on the economic and foreign policy front and germany is accused of disloyalty , " said lang of the swp . " since polish politics is strongly historic , emotions are very intense on the issue , " he said , adding that poland 's focus on close ties and a strategic partnership with the us is also meant to boost it as a regional counterweight to russia in a post-soviet world . ray of hope despite obvious differences between germany and poland , analysts say that there 's still a good chance that bilateral ties may not reach the depths that some fear . " firstly , there 's a solid foundation that german-polish relations are based on and both sides realize the necessity of cooperation .
besides , berlin 's policy towards poland has always been one of continuity , " said lang . dieter bingen said that that much of the recent problems between germany and poland had largely been due to the failure to communicate properly . " much has been said , even by kaczynski , in the heat of the election campaign that have led to a straining of relations .
a lot of emotions have been at play and people will sober up once the election fever is over . " tusk vs. kaczynski but , much more importantly , others point out that the future of bilateral ties crucially depends on who becomes the next polish president - who , unlike the german one , has a say in shaping foreign policy . the choice is between donald tusk of the po and lech kaczynski of the pis who will face off in a re-run of the presidential election in two weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk lay wreaths at the warsaw uprising monument in warsaw experts point out that the po , unlike pis , is much more forward looking , moderate and pragmatic and that its presidential candidate tusk already enjoys good contacts with german chancellor-designate angela merkel 's conservative alliance . " if tusk becomes president , german-polish ties will get a new lease on life , " said ochmann . " but , if kaczynski wins , then it 's going to be a real danger not just for german-polish relations but for poland as a whole in the eu , " he said . " then we may really have to begin worrying .

following a meeting of vw 's supervisory board , europe 's biggest carmaker issued a short statement saying simply that it " welcomed " plans by luxury sports car maker porsche to buy a stake in vw .
the carmaker said it wanted a basic framework agreement to be drawn up in writing " with the aim of achieving a fair balance of interests for the future operational cooperation with porsche . "
no statement was issued regarding piech , however , despite criticism of his double role as both vw supervisory board chief and a member of porsche 's supervisory board .
sources close to the talks said that there had been arguments about piech at the meeting , but that no vote had taken place to decide whether he should stay on or not .
christian wulff , the state premier of lower saxony and a fellow member of vw 's supervisory board , had expressed criticism about piech 's double role , saying it could lead to " a collision of interests . "
porsche announced last week that it had amassed a stake of 18.5 percent in vw , making it the biggest single shareholder in europe 's leading car maker .
the state of lower saxony are the second-biggest shareholder . dw-world.de porsche becomes vw 's major shareholder porsche , the german maker of luxury sports cars , said on friday that it had amassed a stake of more than 18 percent in volkswagen , making it the biggest single shareholder in europe 's leading car maker .

any slip up could mean further derision for klinsmann 's men . germany have hit a wall of criticism in their build-up for the 2006 world cup on home soil and know the knives will be sharpened again should they fail to swat aside china in wednesday 's friendly in hamburg . after a positive 2005 confederations cup , when they reached the semi-finals , germany looked to be on the up but a 2-1 reverse in turkey on saturday represented another setback . " i had too much to do in that game and expect an improvement , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we are being criticized and deservedly so .
but we should not panic and just make sure we turn in a good performance against china . " a 2-0 defeat in slovakia and flattering 2-2 draw with the netherlands has persuaded the media to laugh off claims from jürgen klinsmann that lifting the world cup is realistic . " the criticism we are receiving is fair but we should not hide from it , " declared klinsmann .
" our aim to become world champions has not changed despite recent results . " kaiser criticizes klinsi 's transatlantic lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup winners beckenbauer and klinsmann are at odds over the best way to regain the trophy germany 's performances of late have not been the only fuel for the fire .
west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer has called for klinsmann to spend more time in his homeland ahead of the 2006 world cup finals . klinsmann has resided in the united states since taking charge in july 2004 , often jetting back to his californian home after matches , but beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , feels that can not continue in the build-up to the finals . " in the world cup year he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- should spend more time in germany than the united states , " declared beckenbauer .
" that way he would avoid constant criticism that he is never here . " klinsmann has maintained that he can get a different perspective by living outside of germany but the poor recent results have increased the pressure . " the criticism that has surfaced now is an indication of what it will be like next year , " added beckenbauer .
" a world cup is never easy for any manager . " ballack to miss china clash as pressure increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a result against the likes of china on wednesday may hold off the criticism for a while but germany have to improve .
they face the chinese without bayern munich star michael ballack who will be missing again with the flu but even without their captain germany are expected to see off china at the aol-arena . the warm-up game has an added twist in that sv hamburg will net the match proceeds - expected to reach 1.5 million euros - as compensation for the robert hoyer match-fixing scandal .
in january tainted referee hoyzer admitted to rigging sc paderborn 's 4-2 shock cup victory over hamburg in august 2004 . germany will want to ensure that the underdogs do not come away with a win on wednesday evening and fc cologne striker lukas podolski insists china would not be underestimated .
" we need to play at 100 percent in every game whether we are facing china , liechtenstein or brazil , " stated podolski . chinese would love a big scalp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soccer fans beat drums prior to start of 2002 world cup group c soccer match between china and costa rica , gwangju world cup stadium , south korea , photo having failed to qualify for the 2006 world cup china 's next big challenge is the 2008 olympic games in peking . two chinese stars of the english premiership - everton 's li tie and manchester city 's sun jihai - are two of the big players in the china set-up and manager zhu guanghu admits his team will play on the counter attack .
" we need to switch defense into attack very quickly , " said guanghu .

any slip up could mean further derision for klinsmann 's men . germany have hit a wall of criticism in their build-up for the 2006 world cup on home soil and know the knives will be sharpened again should they fail to swat aside china in wednesday 's friendly in hamburg . after a positive 2005 confederations cup , when they reached the semi-finals , germany looked to be on the up but a 2-1 reverse in turkey on saturday represented another setback . " i had too much to do in that game and expect an improvement , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we are being criticized and deservedly so .
but we should not panic and just make sure we turn in a good performance against china . " a 2-0 defeat in slovakia and flattering 2-2 draw with the netherlands has persuaded the media to laugh off claims from jürgen klinsmann that lifting the world cup is realistic . " the criticism we are receiving is fair but we should not hide from it , " declared klinsmann .
" our aim to become world champions has not changed despite recent results . " kaiser criticizes klinsi 's transatlantic lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup winners beckenbauer and klinsmann are at odds over the best way to regain the trophy germany 's performances of late have not been the only fuel for the fire .
west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer has called for klinsmann to spend more time in his homeland ahead of the 2006 world cup finals . klinsmann has resided in the united states since taking charge in july 2004 , often jetting back to his californian home after matches , but beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , feels that can not continue in the build-up to the finals . " in the world cup year he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- should spend more time in germany than the united states , " declared beckenbauer .
" that way he would avoid constant criticism that he is never here . " klinsmann has maintained that he can get a different perspective by living outside of germany but the poor recent results have increased the pressure . " the criticism that has surfaced now is an indication of what it will be like next year , " added beckenbauer .
" a world cup is never easy for any manager . " ballack to miss china clash as pressure increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a result against the likes of china on wednesday may hold off the criticism for a while but germany have to improve .
they face the chinese without bayern munich star michael ballack who will be missing again with the flu but even without their captain germany are expected to see off china at the aol-arena . the warm-up game has an added twist in that sv hamburg will net the match proceeds - expected to reach 1.5 million euros - as compensation for the robert hoyer match-fixing scandal .
in january tainted referee hoyzer admitted to rigging sc paderborn 's 4-2 shock cup victory over hamburg in august 2004 . germany will want to ensure that the underdogs do not come away with a win on wednesday evening and fc cologne striker lukas podolski insists china would not be underestimated .
" we need to play at 100 percent in every game whether we are facing china , liechtenstein or brazil , " stated podolski . chinese would love a big scalp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soccer fans beat drums prior to start of 2002 world cup group c soccer match between china and costa rica , gwangju world cup stadium , south korea , photo having failed to qualify for the 2006 world cup china 's next big challenge is the 2008 olympic games in peking . two chinese stars of the english premiership - everton 's li tie and manchester city 's sun jihai - are two of the big players in the china set-up and manager zhu guanghu admits his team will play on the counter attack .
" we need to switch defense into attack very quickly , " said guanghu .
" this will be a good learning curve for us .

" it is a turning point , a truly historic moment because of merkel 's background , because of her trajectory which is as unusual as the fact that the country will have a female chancellor , " said the berlin daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
the paper said many had underestimated merkel , who entered politics only 15 years ago after growing up in former east germany , and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder had made the same mistake .
schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .
" what she will do with her new power , what she wants to do with it , is even more of a mystery today than it was before the elections . "
doomed to success ?
the financial times deutschland in its tuesday edition said the unlikely political bedfellows were " doomed to succeed " for the sake of the country , which has watched its former economic glory fade amid rampant unemployment .
" their policy mixture , which will now have to be decided , will need a clear , unifying signature at the bottom of the page - a clear message that reflects what it plans to do and what the people expect . "
it said that if the coalition failed to lift the german economy out of its paralysis , the country was heading for a lingering crisis that will weaken both coalition partners . die welt daily said the fraught election had sent messages to germany 's politicians .
the clearest one was that they can not afford the luxury of dealing in ideology , but must act to resolve germany 's very real problems .
great expectations the süddeutsche zeitung warned that the biggest threat to the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is the great expectations they are expected to fulfill .
" it 's expected that this coalition will achieve what no political power has yet achieved .
' who if not she -lrb- merkel -rrb- ? ' everyone is saying . "
but " what if it 's not her ? " the paper asked .
the social democrats may have counted on merkel being a weak chancellor who would make it easier for them during the next elections .

schröder sought to claim a third term in office after his social democrats narrowly lost september elections to merkel 's christian union alliance , but bowed out after securing his party eight ministries in a coalition with the conservatives . but der tagesspiegel also warned that it was not clear what she could hope to achieve as chancellor at the head of the potentially fractious grand coalition .

but it 's not a done deal until the bundestag votes her in .
dw-world explains what happens next . during their first session , the 614 members of the newly elected bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , will be charged with voting for the next chancellor in a secret ballot , according to germany 's constitution . it 's up to president horst köhler to suggest a candidate for chancellor on oct .
18 and he will most certainly put forward the name of angela merkel , since monday 's agreement between her christian union alliance and the social democrats is likely to ensure a stable majority of votes . köhler is not obliged to suggest the person the parties have singled out , but he must present a candidate who has a reasonable chance of being voted in . if merkel receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting - at least 308 votes in the current bundestag - the president must declare her chancellor .
so far , every german chancellor has been elected in the first round , though it has sometimes been close . konrad adenauer was elected the brd 's first chancellor in 1949 with the barest majority possible .
helmut schmidt and helmut kohl each received only one vote more than necessary when they were elected chancellor in 1974 and 1982 respectively .
gerhard schröder got 305 votes in 2002 , just three more than he needed to be named chancellor .
minority chancellor possible if fewer than 308 parliamentarians vote for merkel in the first round , a second phase of voting starts .
bundestag members may suggest other candidates , gerhard schröder , for example .
but these candidates must have the backing of at least a quarter of the bundestag .
over the subsequent two weeks , an indefinite number of voting rounds may take place . if no chancellor is elected at the end of 14 days one final round of voting takes place .
if a candidate receives an absolute majority he or she is immediately named chancellor .
but if he or she only gains a plurality of votes , president köhler is given seven days to decide whether to accept a so-called " minority chancellor " - who would have the same rights as a chancellor elected by an absolute majority - or to dissolve the bundestag .

the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .

the chancellor question has been answered - now , angela merkel must build an effective coalition government .
she already faces criticism from disgruntled conservatives and social democrats over the division of power . angela merkel won her personal battle with gerhard schröder over who would become chancellor , but victory came at a price . the deal that ended three weeks of political limbo will see schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- take eight ministries , including the powerful portfolios of foreign affairs , labor and justice , as well as health , development aid and cooperation , transport , and environment , party sources said . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will have six portfolios - economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family . on tuesday , both sides retreated to discuss their strategies for the process of sorting out the fine print of their coalition agreement - a process that could stretch well into november . already , merkel is facing criticism from politicians within her own ranks as well as from the spd who fear that the coalition will prove untenable .

were merkel to attempt such a role , the coalition would be over , he warned . merkel 's bavarian ally , christian social union leader edmund stoiber , also said her policy-making power would be severely limited . cdu party manager volker kauder , however , stressed that the parties would agree on common goals during their coalition negotiations .

once seen as a safe pair of hands , mr fazio is mired in controversy journalist marco zatterin remembers the career banker fending off his questions long before mr fazio was appointed governor of the bank of italy .
" we were standing outside a building in rome and talking about interest rates , " says mr zatterin , economics editor of italy 's la stampa newspaper .
" i was trying to discover whether the bank of italy was planning to raise interest rates .
i was trying to push him and he talked to me for 40 minutes about any other subject .
as my questions became more elaborate , his answers became more elaborate . "
mr fazio 's single-mindedness has been sorely tested in recent months .
the head of italy 's central bank has been embroiled in a banking scandal which has rocked his country 's political establishment and led to numerous calls for his resignation , not least from prime minister silvio berlusconi .
telephone tap on monday , mr fazio spent the best part of five hours being questioned by magistrates investigating his handling of banca popolare italiana 's -lrb- bpi -rrb- failed attempt to buy fellow italian bank antonveneta .
it 's very unlikely that he will resign in the short term - if he did , it would be like saying he 's guilty marco zatterin , la stampa economics editor he is alleged to have favoured bpi 's bid to buy antonveneta over a rival cross-border offer from dutch bank abn amro , in march .
leaked transcripts of a phone-tapped conversation suggest that mr fazio was planning to keep antonveneta in italian hands by blocking abn 's bid , despite advice from his own officials that bpi was in no condition to mount a takeover .
the scandal has so far claimed the jobs of italy 's former economy minister and the boss of bpi .
but despite intense pressure for him to quit , mr fazio has denied any wrongdoing and is steadfastly refusing to step down .
italy 's foreign minister gianfranco fini has described mr fazio 's behaviour as " inexplicable and unjustified " , while mr berlusconi has said the governor 's actions are " not compatible with national credibility " .
but italy 's government says it is powerless to remove mr fazio who , under italian rules , is entitled to keep his job for life .
devout catholic last week , the italian senate approved plans to limit future terms of office for bank of italy governors to seven years , although any change in the law will not apply to mr fazio .
italy 's pm says he 's done all he can to encourage mr fazio to quit and despite the political maelstrom surrounding mr fazio , who was embarrassingly stripped of his right to speak for italy at a recent international monetary fund meeting in washington , the central bank governor still has his allies .
the right-wing northern league , a junior member of mr berlusconi 's government , has called for mr fazio to stay , while the roman catholic church has expressed support for the banker .
mr fazio makes no secret of his devout catholicism .
most crucially of all , mr fazio has the backing of the bank of italy 's 13-member board of directors , the only body in the country with the legal power to fire him .
but onlookers say that the scandal is damaging italy 's standing internationally .
" this painful affair is eroding italy 's credibility on a daily basis , " said the european commission 's former competition commissioner mario monti recently .
" it is damaging , " says mr zatterin .
" if a bank from abroad makes an offer for an italian bank they will have all sorts of suspicions .
there are lots of doubts about the way rules and regulations are applied in italy now .
that is a real problem for italy . "
safe hands mr fazio has not always been regarded as such a controversial figure .
born in 1936 in the small town of alvito , south of rome , he graduated with a degree in economics from rome university and joined the bank of italy in 1960 .
a family man with five children , mr fazio secured a reputation as a serious and respected banker on his journey to the top , and was considered a safe pair of hands when appointed governor in 1993 .
he maintained the image of the bank of italy as an incorruptible institution , steering it through the notoriously choppy waters of italy 's political scene .
although a eurosceptic , mr fazio even ensured his country was ready -lrb- at least on paper -rrb- to ditch the lira and adopt the euro in 1999 .
enemies within in recent years , though , mr fazio has shown himself as an opponent of foreign takeovers of italian banks , despite european commission efforts to make cross-border mergers easier .
meanwhile , his increasingly abrasive manner has ruffled feathers in government .
the italian minister who humiliated him at the washington imf gathering , giulio tremonti , is an old enemy .
but mr fazio 's stubbornness in the face of his critics remains intact , and few expect an appearance before investigating magistrates on monday to shake him .
" it 's very unlikely that he will resign in the short term , " says la stampa 's economics editor .
" if he did , it would be like saying he 's guilty . "
and with national elections due next year , there is a chance that mr fazio will remain in office longer than some of his most outspoken critics .
" he may outlast berlusconi , " says mr zatterin .

once seen as a safe pair of hands , mr fazio is mired in controversy journalist marco zatterin remembers the career banker fending off his questions long before mr fazio was appointed governor of the bank of italy .
" we were standing outside a building in rome and talking about interest rates , " says mr zatterin , economics editor of italy 's la stampa newspaper .
" i was trying to discover whether the bank of italy was planning to raise interest rates .
i was trying to push him and he talked to me for 40 minutes about any other subject .
as my questions became more elaborate , his answers became more elaborate . "
mr fazio 's single-mindedness has been sorely tested in recent months .
the head of italy 's central bank has been embroiled in a banking scandal which has rocked his country 's political establishment and led to numerous calls for his resignation , not least from prime minister silvio berlusconi .
telephone tap on monday , mr fazio spent the best part of five hours being questioned by magistrates investigating his handling of banca popolare italiana 's -lrb- bpi -rrb- failed attempt to buy fellow italian bank antonveneta .
it 's very unlikely that he will resign in the short term - if he did , it would be like saying he 's guilty marco zatterin , la stampa economics editor he is alleged to have favoured bpi 's bid to buy antonveneta over a rival cross-border offer from dutch bank abn amro , in march .
leaked transcripts of a phone-tapped conversation suggest that mr fazio was planning to keep antonveneta in italian hands by blocking abn 's bid , despite advice from his own officials that bpi was in no condition to mount a takeover .
the scandal has so far claimed the jobs of italy 's former economy minister and the boss of bpi .
but despite intense pressure for him to quit , mr fazio has denied any wrongdoing and is steadfastly refusing to step down .
italy 's foreign minister gianfranco fini has described mr fazio 's behaviour as " inexplicable and unjustified " , while mr berlusconi has said the governor 's actions are " not compatible with national credibility " .
but italy 's government says it is powerless to remove mr fazio who , under italian rules , is entitled to keep his job for life .
devout catholic last week , the italian senate approved plans to limit future terms of office for bank of italy governors to seven years , although any change in the law will not apply to mr fazio .
italy 's pm says he 's done all he can to encourage mr fazio to quit and despite the political maelstrom surrounding mr fazio , who was embarrassingly stripped of his right to speak for italy at a recent international monetary fund meeting in washington , the central bank governor still has his allies .
the right-wing northern league , a junior member of mr berlusconi 's government , has called for mr fazio to stay , while the roman catholic church has expressed support for the banker .
mr fazio makes no secret of his devout catholicism .
most crucially of all , mr fazio has the backing of the bank of italy 's 13-member board of directors , the only body in the country with the legal power to fire him .
but onlookers say that the scandal is damaging italy 's standing internationally .
" this painful affair is eroding italy 's credibility on a daily basis , " said the european commission 's former competition commissioner mario monti recently .
" it is damaging , " says mr zatterin .
" if a bank from abroad makes an offer for an italian bank they will have all sorts of suspicions .
there are lots of doubts about the way rules and regulations are applied in italy now .
that is a real problem for italy . "
safe hands mr fazio has not always been regarded as such a controversial figure .
born in 1936 in the small town of alvito , south of rome , he graduated with a degree in economics from rome university and joined the bank of italy in 1960 .
a family man with five children , mr fazio secured a reputation as a serious and respected banker on his journey to the top , and was considered a safe pair of hands when appointed governor in 1993 .
he maintained the image of the bank of italy as an incorruptible institution , steering it through the notoriously choppy waters of italy 's political scene .
although a eurosceptic , mr fazio even ensured his country was ready -lrb- at least on paper -rrb- to ditch the lira and adopt the euro in 1999 .
enemies within in recent years , though , mr fazio has shown himself as an opponent of foreign takeovers of italian banks , despite european commission efforts to make cross-border mergers easier .
meanwhile , his increasingly abrasive manner has ruffled feathers in government .
the italian minister who humiliated him at the washington imf gathering , giulio tremonti , is an old enemy .
but mr fazio 's stubbornness in the face of his critics remains intact , and few expect an appearance before investigating magistrates on monday to shake him .
" it 's very unlikely that he will resign in the short term , " says la stampa 's economics editor .
" if he did , it would be like saying he 's guilty . "
and with national elections due next year , there is a chance that mr fazio will remain in office longer than some of his most outspoken critics .
" he may outlast berlusconi , " says mr zatterin .
