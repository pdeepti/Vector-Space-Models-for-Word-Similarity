" friends should not treat each other this way and neither should contractual partners , " maurus said of relations between berlin and moscow , referring to a 1989 bilateral agreement on the return of trophy art .

according to the president of the organization , sepp blatter , referees and assistants hoping to officiate at matches during next year 's world cup in germany will be closely watched when the confederations cup gets underway june 15 .
underperforming refs will be sent home as part of a new effort to raise standards in international competitions .
some have already been sent home from the world youth championship in the netherlands and more will follow , says blatter , who has criticized the refereeing at the 2002 world cup .
" there will be no repeat of the weak performances at the 2002 world cup , " he said .
blatter is also an advocate of paying referees salaries as a means of cutting down on the chances of match-fixing scandals such as the one that recently hit germany , when robert hoyzer accepted money to rig a match for croatian gamblers . dw-world.de referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .

green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .

green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .
air berlin , has said it would follow lufthansa 's example and sell tickets to agents without any commission , leaving it up to the agents whether to mark up the tickets for the customer and pocket the difference . dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.06.2005 a blunder waiting to happen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah connor blamed nerves for her anthem mix-up a series of screw-ups by singers performing the german national anthem has reignited a touchy debate about german patriotism , or lack thereof . most americans can reel off the words to " the star-spangled banner " with nary a second thought .
even cool britons can mouth along to " god save the queen " or " rule britannia . "
but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand . " rondine 's blunder-filled rendition came just days after german pop star sarah connor had a similarly humiliating experience at the opening of a new sports arena in munich before almost 10 million television viewers . when it came time for the line " blossom in the glow of this happiness , " the 25-year-old performer floundered and instead sang : " brew in light of this happiness . " connor apologized for the mix-up .
but in germany , it has only had the effect of endearing her even more to her legions of young fans , who do n't know or do n't care to know the words of their national anthem . even the federal environment minister , jürgen trittin , once boasted that he has never sung the national anthem and has no plans to ever sing it . contentious lyrics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian composer joseph haydn composed the melody for " das deutschlandlied " admittedly , the song has a thorny history .
though " das deutschlandlied " has been the german anthem since 1922 , its first line , " deutschland , deutschland über alles , " which translates as " germany above everything , " was given sinister meaning under the rule of adolf hitler .
the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .
that 's because the organizers have decided that all the anthems sung during the event will be played from recordings . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de müsli instead of sauerkraut hitler , war , beer , cars - americans who still exclusively associate that with germany can drop in at new york 's grand central for an exhibition to clear up those clichés and find out what makes modern germany tick .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .
a team combining gysi and lafontaine has made many on the left salivate at the prospects of leapfrogging the green party , currently junior coalition partners in schröder 's government , to become the country 's third-biggest party . but the new left is anything but solid , say observers and party members .
the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .

" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .

last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit eu attempts to untie budget tangles meet the eu 's deficit sinners curing the eu 's democratic deficit ? europe -pipe- 14.06.2005 eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu pays out 43,500,000,000 euros per year for agriculture eu leaders will meet this week for crisis talks on the bloc 's long-term budget .
but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .
" once the pressure of time becomes crucial enough , then they 'll find a solution , " he said . he added that the fact that agricultural policy would " come away unscathed is relatively annoying . " marcus bösch -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .
there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . -lrb- june 14 , 2005 -rrb- eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks .

the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .

from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .
and schröder 's words of compromise wo n't carry much weight : he 's already considered a lame duck in berlin and brussels . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .

-lrb- june 13 , 2005 -rrb- berlin , paris push ahead with eu french and german leaders said on friday europe must unite and press ahead with ratifying the eu constitution .
at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .
" veiled cannibalism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder fears germany could fall behind but politicians from the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrat 's junior coalition partner , the greens , criticized the chancellor 's comments . the right to life of an embryo must be respected despite the scientific and economic successes that stem cell research promises , cdu parliamentarian thomas rachel demanded .
green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .
1 , 2002 .
they must also have been developed from artificially created embryos that were originally meant for pregnancy and not for research . schröder has in the past said he was in favor of liberalizing the legislation , though not publicly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .

but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .
" veiled cannibalism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder fears germany could fall behind but politicians from the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrat 's junior coalition partner , the greens , criticized the chancellor 's comments . the right to life of an embryo must be respected despite the scientific and economic successes that stem cell research promises , cdu parliamentarian thomas rachel demanded .
green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .
1 , 2002 .
they must also have been developed from artificially created embryos that were originally meant for pregnancy and not for research . schröder has in the past said he was in favor of liberalizing the legislation , though not publicly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.06.2005 a blunder waiting to happen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah connor blamed nerves for her anthem mix-up a series of screw-ups by singers performing the german national anthem has reignited a touchy debate about german patriotism , or lack thereof . most americans can reel off the words to " the star-spangled banner " with nary a second thought .
even cool britons can mouth along to " god save the queen " or " rule britannia . "
but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand . " rondine 's blunder-filled rendition came just days after german pop star sarah connor had a similarly humiliating experience at the opening of a new sports arena in munich before almost 10 million television viewers . when it came time for the line " blossom in the glow of this happiness , " the 25-year-old performer floundered and instead sang : " brew in light of this happiness . " connor apologized for the mix-up .
but in germany , it has only had the effect of endearing her even more to her legions of young fans , who do n't know or do n't care to know the words of their national anthem . even the federal environment minister , jürgen trittin , once boasted that he has never sung the national anthem and has no plans to ever sing it . contentious lyrics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian composer joseph haydn composed the melody for " das deutschlandlied " admittedly , the song has a thorny history .
though " das deutschlandlied " has been the german anthem since 1922 , its first line , " deutschland , deutschland über alles , " which translates as " germany above everything , " was given sinister meaning under the rule of adolf hitler .
the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .
that 's because the organizers have decided that all the anthems sung during the event will be played from recordings . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de müsli instead of sauerkraut hitler , war , beer , cars - americans who still exclusively associate that with germany can drop in at new york 's grand central for an exhibition to clear up those clichés and find out what makes modern germany tick .
-lrb- june 5 , 2005 -rrb- fears of nationalism as pop pushes german pride young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .

even cool britons can mouth along to " god save the queen " or " rule britannia . "
but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand . " rondine 's blunder-filled rendition came just days after german pop star sarah connor had a similarly humiliating experience at the opening of a new sports arena in munich before almost 10 million television viewers . when it came time for the line " blossom in the glow of this happiness , " the 25-year-old performer floundered and instead sang : " brew in light of this happiness . " connor apologized for the mix-up .
but in germany , it has only had the effect of endearing her even more to her legions of young fans , who do n't know or do n't care to know the words of their national anthem . even the federal environment minister , jürgen trittin , once boasted that he has never sung the national anthem and has no plans to ever sing it . contentious lyrics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian composer joseph haydn composed the melody for " das deutschlandlied " admittedly , the song has a thorny history .
though " das deutschlandlied " has been the german anthem since 1922 , its first line , " deutschland , deutschland über alles , " which translates as " germany above everything , " was given sinister meaning under the rule of adolf hitler .
the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .

schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .
a team combining gysi and lafontaine has made many on the left salivate at the prospects of leapfrogging the green party , currently junior coalition partners in schröder 's government , to become the country 's third-biggest party . but the new left is anything but solid , say observers and party members .
the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election . -lrb- may 25 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .
officials also announced possible action against portugal .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .

the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .
a team combining gysi and lafontaine has made many on the left salivate at the prospects of leapfrogging the green party , currently junior coalition partners in schröder 's government , to become the country 's third-biggest party . but the new left is anything but solid , say observers and party members .
the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- june 10 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election . -lrb- may 25 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .

but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .
air berlin , has said it would follow lufthansa 's example and sell tickets to agents without any commission , leaving it up to the agents whether to mark up the tickets for the customer and pocket the difference . dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .

green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "

according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .

in an interview with business daily handelsblatt , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann said " we are ready to make acquisitions in all markets where we are already present , as well as in new markets , such as in developing countries . "
in particular , postbank , the banking arm of deutsche post " would be a good strategic perspective , " he said .
germany 's biggest bank had been planning to buy postbank last year , on the behest of the german government , but broke off the talks .
asked about the acquisition of smaller rival , commerzbank , ackermann said : " from the german point of view , -lrb- domestic -rrb- consolidation would make a lot of sense because it would create stronger german banks which would then be able to operate better globally . "
however , before that can happen , the chairman said there needed to be the necessary political and social support . dw-world.de a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .
the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.06.2005 a blunder waiting to happen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah connor blamed nerves for her anthem mix-up a series of screw-ups by singers performing the german national anthem has reignited a touchy debate about german patriotism , or lack thereof . most americans can reel off the words to " the star-spangled banner " with nary a second thought .
even cool britons can mouth along to " god save the queen " or " rule britannia . "
but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand .

but in germany , it has only had the effect of endearing her even more to her legions of young fans , who do n't know or do n't care to know the words of their national anthem . even the federal environment minister , jürgen trittin , once boasted that he has never sung the national anthem and has no plans to ever sing it . contentious lyrics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian composer joseph haydn composed the melody for " das deutschlandlied " admittedly , the song has a thorny history .
though " das deutschlandlied " has been the german anthem since 1922 , its first line , " deutschland , deutschland über alles , " which translates as " germany above everything , " was given sinister meaning under the rule of adolf hitler .
the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .
" once the pressure of time becomes crucial enough , then they 'll find a solution , " he said . he added that the fact that agricultural policy would " come away unscathed is relatively annoying .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .
" veiled cannibalism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder fears germany could fall behind but politicians from the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrat 's junior coalition partner , the greens , criticized the chancellor 's comments . the right to life of an embryo must be respected despite the scientific and economic successes that stem cell research promises , cdu parliamentarian thomas rachel demanded .
green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .
1 , 2002 .
they must also have been developed from artificially created embryos that were originally meant for pregnancy and not for research . schröder has in the past said he was in favor of liberalizing the legislation , though not publicly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .

but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .
and schröder 's words of compromise wo n't carry much weight : he 's already considered a lame duck in berlin and brussels . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 leadership row leaves eads grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 stole the show in paris but all is not well behind the scenes the bitter power struggle at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has put the company in an embarrassing spot as it appears leaderless at the prestigious international paris air show this week . airbus ' new super-jumbo a380 , the world 's largest airliner , was the undisputed star of the glitzy inauguration of the weeklong aviation show at le bourget airport , north of paris , on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk past planes on the opening day of the 46th international paris air show at le bourget airport , north of paris .
but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .

even cool britons can mouth along to " god save the queen " or " rule britannia . "
but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand . " rondine 's blunder-filled rendition came just days after german pop star sarah connor had a similarly humiliating experience at the opening of a new sports arena in munich before almost 10 million television viewers . when it came time for the line " blossom in the glow of this happiness , " the 25-year-old performer floundered and instead sang : " brew in light of this happiness . " connor apologized for the mix-up .
but in germany , it has only had the effect of endearing her even more to her legions of young fans , who do n't know or do n't care to know the words of their national anthem . even the federal environment minister , jürgen trittin , once boasted that he has never sung the national anthem and has no plans to ever sing it . contentious lyrics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian composer joseph haydn composed the melody for " das deutschlandlied " admittedly , the song has a thorny history .
though " das deutschlandlied " has been the german anthem since 1922 , its first line , " deutschland , deutschland über alles , " which translates as " germany above everything , " was given sinister meaning under the rule of adolf hitler .
the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .
" veiled cannibalism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder fears germany could fall behind but politicians from the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrat 's junior coalition partner , the greens , criticized the chancellor 's comments . the right to life of an embryo must be respected despite the scientific and economic successes that stem cell research promises , cdu parliamentarian thomas rachel demanded .
green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .
1 , 2002 .
they must also have been developed from artificially created embryos that were originally meant for pregnancy and not for research . schröder has in the past said he was in favor of liberalizing the legislation , though not publicly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .
and schröder 's words of compromise wo n't carry much weight : he 's already considered a lame duck in berlin and brussels . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks .
-lrb- june 13 , 2005 -rrb- berlin , paris push ahead with eu french and german leaders said on friday europe must unite and press ahead with ratifying the eu constitution .
at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate .
-lrb- june 10 , 2005 -rrb- eu battles to keep crisis from widening the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on .

but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 leadership row leaves eads grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 stole the show in paris but all is not well behind the scenes the bitter power struggle at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has put the company in an embarrassing spot as it appears leaderless at the prestigious international paris air show this week . airbus ' new super-jumbo a380 , the world 's largest airliner , was the undisputed star of the glitzy inauguration of the weeklong aviation show at le bourget airport , north of paris , on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk past planes on the opening day of the 46th international paris air show at le bourget airport , north of paris .
but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .
-lrb- june 1 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us face off at wto in aircraft spat a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .
-lrb- april 31 , 2005 -rrb- us seeks arbitration over airbus subsidies the us will ask the world trade organization tuesday to create an arbitration panel to resolve a dispute over european subsidies to aircraft maker airbus , the us trade representative said in a statement .

even cool britons can mouth along to " god save the queen " or " rule britannia . "
but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand . " rondine 's blunder-filled rendition came just days after german pop star sarah connor had a similarly humiliating experience at the opening of a new sports arena in munich before almost 10 million television viewers . when it came time for the line " blossom in the glow of this happiness , " the 25-year-old performer floundered and instead sang : " brew in light of this happiness . " connor apologized for the mix-up .
but in germany , it has only had the effect of endearing her even more to her legions of young fans , who do n't know or do n't care to know the words of their national anthem . even the federal environment minister , jürgen trittin , once boasted that he has never sung the national anthem and has no plans to ever sing it . contentious lyrics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian composer joseph haydn composed the melody for " das deutschlandlied " admittedly , the song has a thorny history .
though " das deutschlandlied " has been the german anthem since 1922 , its first line , " deutschland , deutschland über alles , " which translates as " germany above everything , " was given sinister meaning under the rule of adolf hitler .
the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .
" once the pressure of time becomes crucial enough , then they 'll find a solution , " he said . he added that the fact that agricultural policy would " come away unscathed is relatively annoying .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .
and schröder 's words of compromise wo n't carry much weight : he 's already considered a lame duck in berlin and brussels . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .
officials also announced possible action against portugal .
-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- imf chief blasts weak eu budget rules when france and germany , chronic violators of eu budget requirements , pushed for a weakening of those rules , they hardly expected to attract imf attention .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .
a team combining gysi and lafontaine has made many on the left salivate at the prospects of leapfrogging the green party , currently junior coalition partners in schröder 's government , to become the country 's third-biggest party . but the new left is anything but solid , say observers and party members .
the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .
a team combining gysi and lafontaine has made many on the left salivate at the prospects of leapfrogging the green party , currently junior coalition partners in schröder 's government , to become the country 's third-biggest party . but the new left is anything but solid , say observers and party members .
the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc budget airlines raided in price-fixing probe the offices of four german airlines have been searched by the competition authorities on suspicion of possible price fixing , the airlines said on tuesday .
ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .
air berlin , has said it would follow lufthansa 's example and sell tickets to agents without any commission , leaving it up to the agents whether to mark up the tickets for the customer and pocket the difference . dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .
a team combining gysi and lafontaine has made many on the left salivate at the prospects of leapfrogging the green party , currently junior coalition partners in schröder 's government , to become the country 's third-biggest party . but the new left is anything but solid , say observers and party members .
the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- june 10 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election . -lrb- may 25 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .

the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .

but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way .

" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .

in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .

the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.06.2005 schröder wants stem cell laws eased großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few scientists are allowed to do research on stem cells in germany a day after italians rejected easing their prohibitive law on fertility and bioethics , chancellor gerhard schröder declared that germany should liberalize its own restrictive legislation on stem cell research . " we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .
" veiled cannibalism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder fears germany could fall behind but politicians from the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrat 's junior coalition partner , the greens , criticized the chancellor 's comments . the right to life of an embryo must be respected despite the scientific and economic successes that stem cell research promises , cdu parliamentarian thomas rachel demanded .
green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .
1 , 2002 .
they must also have been developed from artificially created embryos that were originally meant for pregnancy and not for research . schröder has in the past said he was in favor of liberalizing the legislation , though not publicly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .
a team combining gysi and lafontaine has made many on the left salivate at the prospects of leapfrogging the green party , currently junior coalition partners in schröder 's government , to become the country 's third-biggest party . but the new left is anything but solid , say observers and party members .
the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .
air berlin , has said it would follow lufthansa 's example and sell tickets to agents without any commission , leaving it up to the agents whether to mark up the tickets for the customer and pocket the difference . dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit eu attempts to untie budget tangles meet the eu 's deficit sinners curing the eu 's democratic deficit ? europe -pipe- 14.06.2005 eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu pays out 43,500,000,000 euros per year for agriculture eu leaders will meet this week for crisis talks on the bloc 's long-term budget .
but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .
" once the pressure of time becomes crucial enough , then they 'll find a solution , " he said . he added that the fact that agricultural policy would " come away unscathed is relatively annoying . " marcus bösch -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .
air berlin , has said it would follow lufthansa 's example and sell tickets to agents without any commission , leaving it up to the agents whether to mark up the tickets for the customer and pocket the difference . dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .
a team combining gysi and lafontaine has made many on the left salivate at the prospects of leapfrogging the green party , currently junior coalition partners in schröder 's government , to become the country 's third-biggest party . but the new left is anything but solid , say observers and party members .
the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- june 10 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election . -lrb- may 25 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .

" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .

forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .
-lrb- june 1 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us face off at wto in aircraft spat a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .

gysi -lrb- l . -rrb- and lafontaine might lead the left with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ? in the run-up to this fall 's expected federal elections , germany 's political left will rail against chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor and welfare reform packages in their bid to storm back into the bundestag .
but at the moment , they 're pre-occupied with much smaller things , namely , what to call themselves . the founding of the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- as a reaction to schröder 's reform packages , has been spearheaded by former finance minister and political star oskar lafontaine .
schröder 's most prominent critic from the left is looking to form a political alliance with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's communist party which remains the third-strongest voice in the country 's eastern states . over the weekend , the pds , eager to get another shot at entering the bundestag after failing to get enough votes in 2002 , floated the " democratic left - pds " as a possible name for the alliance .
but many leftist stalwarts in the western part of the country are skeptical of the pds , which is still viewed as an eastern german party .
" we know that the pds does n't always sound good , " in the west , pds chief lothar bisky acknowledged . good chances - if it takes off this coming weekend , bisky , former pds star and media darling gregor gysi and other party officials will meet with lafontaine in an effort to reach an agreement on the name . the potential east-west alliance has good chances if schröder 's wish to call federal elections this fall is granted by germany 's president and the bundestag .
a recent poll by public broadcaster zdf said 18 percent of the population would consider voting for a leftist alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't going well for schröder dissatisfaction with schröder 's labor market reform program , dubbed hartz iv , has plunged his government into a crisis .
staggering losses suffered by his social democrats in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 prompted schröder to take the unusual tactic of calling general elections , scheduled for 2006 , one year early . third-largest party ? analysts are bleak about his chances against the opposition christian democratic union and the fdp , their likely coalition partners in a new government .
polls show the spd getting only 35 percent of the vote , with a strong leftist alliance possibly peeling even more percentage points away .
a team combining gysi and lafontaine has made many on the left salivate at the prospects of leapfrogging the green party , currently junior coalition partners in schröder 's government , to become the country 's third-biggest party . but the new left is anything but solid , say observers and party members .
the wasg will find its voters by criticizing schröder 's reform course as overly harsh , and contrary to social democratic tradition .
the pds has traditionally won support from disgruntled east germans who embrace its criticism of capitalism . " we are unified in the rejection of the government 's social policies and … hartz iv , but that 's about it , " said petra pau , a pds leader in berlin . whatever the outcome of this weekend 's talks , the pds has already reached one goal : after three years in which they disappeared from the national political stage , people are once again talking about them . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

in an interview with business daily handelsblatt , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann said " we are ready to make acquisitions in all markets where we are already present , as well as in new markets , such as in developing countries . "
in particular , postbank , the banking arm of deutsche post " would be a good strategic perspective , " he said .
germany 's biggest bank had been planning to buy postbank last year , on the behest of the german government , but broke off the talks .
asked about the acquisition of smaller rival , commerzbank , ackermann said : " from the german point of view , -lrb- domestic -rrb- consolidation would make a lot of sense because it would create stronger german banks which would then be able to operate better globally . "
however , before that can happen , the chairman said there needed to be the necessary political and social support . dw-world.de a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 leadership row leaves eads grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 stole the show in paris but all is not well behind the scenes the bitter power struggle at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has put the company in an embarrassing spot as it appears leaderless at the prestigious international paris air show this week . airbus ' new super-jumbo a380 , the world 's largest airliner , was the undisputed star of the glitzy inauguration of the weeklong aviation show at le bourget airport , north of paris , on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk past planes on the opening day of the 46th international paris air show at le bourget airport , north of paris .
but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 leadership row leaves eads grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 stole the show in paris but all is not well behind the scenes the bitter power struggle at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has put the company in an embarrassing spot as it appears leaderless at the prestigious international paris air show this week . airbus ' new super-jumbo a380 , the world 's largest airliner , was the undisputed star of the glitzy inauguration of the weeklong aviation show at le bourget airport , north of paris , on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk past planes on the opening day of the 46th international paris air show at le bourget airport , north of paris .
but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .
" once the pressure of time becomes crucial enough , then they 'll find a solution , " he said . he added that the fact that agricultural policy would " come away unscathed is relatively annoying .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .
air berlin , has said it would follow lufthansa 's example and sell tickets to agents without any commission , leaving it up to the agents whether to mark up the tickets for the customer and pocket the difference . dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

in an interview with business daily handelsblatt , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann said " we are ready to make acquisitions in all markets where we are already present , as well as in new markets , such as in developing countries . "
in particular , postbank , the banking arm of deutsche post " would be a good strategic perspective , " he said .
germany 's biggest bank had been planning to buy postbank last year , on the behest of the german government , but broke off the talks .
asked about the acquisition of smaller rival , commerzbank , ackermann said : " from the german point of view , -lrb- domestic -rrb- consolidation would make a lot of sense because it would create stronger german banks which would then be able to operate better globally . "
however , before that can happen , the chairman said there needed to be the necessary political and social support . dw-world.de a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .
the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .
air berlin , has said it would follow lufthansa 's example and sell tickets to agents without any commission , leaving it up to the agents whether to mark up the tickets for the customer and pocket the difference . dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .
" veiled cannibalism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder fears germany could fall behind but politicians from the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrat 's junior coalition partner , the greens , criticized the chancellor 's comments . the right to life of an embryo must be respected despite the scientific and economic successes that stem cell research promises , cdu parliamentarian thomas rachel demanded .
green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .
1 , 2002 .
they must also have been developed from artificially created embryos that were originally meant for pregnancy and not for research . schröder has in the past said he was in favor of liberalizing the legislation , though not publicly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .
and schröder 's words of compromise wo n't carry much weight : he 's already considered a lame duck in berlin and brussels . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks .

at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .
and schröder 's words of compromise wo n't carry much weight : he 's already considered a lame duck in berlin and brussels . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks .
-lrb- june 13 , 2005 -rrb- berlin , paris push ahead with eu french and german leaders said on friday europe must unite and press ahead with ratifying the eu constitution .
at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way .

" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.06.2005 schröder wants stem cell laws eased großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few scientists are allowed to do research on stem cells in germany a day after italians rejected easing their prohibitive law on fertility and bioethics , chancellor gerhard schröder declared that germany should liberalize its own restrictive legislation on stem cell research . " we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .
air berlin , has said it would follow lufthansa 's example and sell tickets to agents without any commission , leaving it up to the agents whether to mark up the tickets for the customer and pocket the difference . dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores curing the eu 's democratic deficit ? business -pipe- 14.06.2005 meet the eu 's deficit sinners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disobedient eu countries keep commissioner almunia busy although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .
there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .
officials also announced possible action against portugal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 -pipe- 10:00 utc deutsche bank seeks takeover targets following the acquisition of hypovereinsbank by italian giant unicredit , germany 's largest bank announced tuesday it is ready to make its own acquisitions , both inside and outside germany .
in an interview with business daily handelsblatt , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann said " we are ready to make acquisitions in all markets where we are already present , as well as in new markets , such as in developing countries . "
in particular , postbank , the banking arm of deutsche post " would be a good strategic perspective , " he said .
germany 's biggest bank had been planning to buy postbank last year , on the behest of the german government , but broke off the talks .
asked about the acquisition of smaller rival , commerzbank , ackermann said : " from the german point of view , -lrb- domestic -rrb- consolidation would make a lot of sense because it would create stronger german banks which would then be able to operate better globally . "

but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores curing the eu 's democratic deficit ? business -pipe- 14.06.2005 meet the eu 's deficit sinners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disobedient eu countries keep commissioner almunia busy although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .
there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .
officials also announced possible action against portugal .
-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- imf chief blasts weak eu budget rules when france and germany , chronic violators of eu budget requirements , pushed for a weakening of those rules , they hardly expected to attract imf attention .

even cool britons can mouth along to " god save the queen " or " rule britannia . "
but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand . " rondine 's blunder-filled rendition came just days after german pop star sarah connor had a similarly humiliating experience at the opening of a new sports arena in munich before almost 10 million television viewers . when it came time for the line " blossom in the glow of this happiness , " the 25-year-old performer floundered and instead sang : " brew in light of this happiness . " connor apologized for the mix-up .
but in germany , it has only had the effect of endearing her even more to her legions of young fans , who do n't know or do n't care to know the words of their national anthem . even the federal environment minister , jürgen trittin , once boasted that he has never sung the national anthem and has no plans to ever sing it . contentious lyrics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian composer joseph haydn composed the melody for " das deutschlandlied " admittedly , the song has a thorny history .
though " das deutschlandlied " has been the german anthem since 1922 , its first line , " deutschland , deutschland über alles , " which translates as " germany above everything , " was given sinister meaning under the rule of adolf hitler .
the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .
that 's because the organizers have decided that all the anthems sung during the event will be played from recordings . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de müsli instead of sauerkraut hitler , war , beer , cars - americans who still exclusively associate that with germany can drop in at new york 's grand central for an exhibition to clear up those clichés and find out what makes modern germany tick .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 leadership row leaves eads grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 stole the show in paris but all is not well behind the scenes the bitter power struggle at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has put the company in an embarrassing spot as it appears leaderless at the prestigious international paris air show this week . airbus ' new super-jumbo a380 , the world 's largest airliner , was the undisputed star of the glitzy inauguration of the weeklong aviation show at le bourget airport , north of paris , on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk past planes on the opening day of the 46th international paris air show at le bourget airport , north of paris .
but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has appealed for unity and compromise at this week 's european union summit in brussels .
but is anyone listening ? a few weeks before he hits the campaign trail again , german foreign minister joschka fischer released a new book . in " the return of history , " chancellor gerhard schröder 's deputy waxes philosophical about the world he has seen in his almost seven years as germany 's face abroad .
in parts , fischer reflects on change on his continent , and warns against the dangers in a europe that rejects the european union .
" i fear there is a danger of a rampant re-emergence of nationalism with all its consequences within a weakened eu , " he writes .
though written ahead of the " no " votes delivered in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution , the passage foreshadows the crisis in which the 25-member organization finds itself .
on thursday and friday , eu leaders will meet for the first time since the no votes to discuss the eu 's heavily-debated budget for 2007-2013 .
in the weeks leading up to the meeting , schröder has met with british leader tony blair and french president jacques chirac and spoken out a number of times on the desperate need to show unity and willingness to compromise . " we are awaiting from all partners the willingness to move " on issues , said schröder after meeting blair late monday . who 's listening to germany ? the german chancellor was speaking in reference to the budget debate , where great britain is fiercely defending the 3 billion pound -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- rebate they receive from the eu states each year , something many member states want re-thought or vanquished all together .
but the group of 25 heads of state wo n't get around also addressing the crisis in eu identity after the rejection of the constitution in two of the body 's founding member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two days after france voted no on the european union constitution , the netherlands followed .
schröder and fischer still hope to salvage the constitution and have urged the continuation of the referendums in the remaining seven eu countries still planning them .
polls indicate the german population stands behind the constitution , and both houses of the country 's parliament have now ratified the document . despite their efforts to profile themselves as european mediators , no one back home seems to be listening , or even care .
germans have other priorities at the moment . following massive losses by his party in state elections in late may , schröder called for elections this fall , a year earlier than planned .
unemployment remains high , and the vast majority of the population seems ready to reject schröder 's reform of germany 's generous welfare state and costly labor market .
polls indicate cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel to be the clear winner if the election were held this week . merkel 's changing eu a victory by the conservative candidate from the former east would mean a decidedly different germany in european affairs .
the bits of rhetoric the merkel camp has let fly in the weeks since the social democrats ' may 22 defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia , have not been good news for european integrationists and federalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel on a visit to istanbul in february 2004 the cdu , which has continually rejected turkey 's plan to become a full member of the eu by 2015 , said they will most likely urge brussels to apply the brakes on further enlargement .
this week , merkel and other opposition leaders urged schröder not to compromise or promise too much on the eu budget . eu leaders have already indicated they are planning for a new chancellor come this fall . blair , who flew to berlin to meet schröder , had a lengthy conversation with merkel on monday evening - an indication that he at least is considering the possibility of another person having the say in berlin . rocky road ahead regardless of who rules in berlin after the fall elections , the road to brussels will not be smooth sailing . blair has refused to budge on britain 's rebate - won by margaret thatcher in 1984 to make up the difference between what britain paid into the eu and what it got back - and lashed out at french premier jacques chirac for refusing to compromise on the eu 's agricultural budget , of which france is the greatest beneficiary . observers say that should the two not iron out their differences at the summit , then the upcoming uk presidency of the european union , which takes over the rotating post from luxembourg , could be a difficult tenure .
and schröder 's words of compromise wo n't carry much weight : he 's already considered a lame duck in berlin and brussels . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .
" once the pressure of time becomes crucial enough , then they 'll find a solution , " he said . he added that the fact that agricultural policy would " come away unscathed is relatively annoying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 leadership row leaves eads grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 stole the show in paris but all is not well behind the scenes the bitter power struggle at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has put the company in an embarrassing spot as it appears leaderless at the prestigious international paris air show this week . airbus ' new super-jumbo a380 , the world 's largest airliner , was the undisputed star of the glitzy inauguration of the weeklong aviation show at le bourget airport , north of paris , on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk past planes on the opening day of the 46th international paris air show at le bourget airport , north of paris .
but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .
-lrb- june 1 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us face off at wto in aircraft spat a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit eu attempts to untie budget tangles meet the eu 's deficit sinners curing the eu 's democratic deficit ? europe -pipe- 14.06.2005 eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu pays out 43,500,000,000 euros per year for agriculture eu leaders will meet this week for crisis talks on the bloc 's long-term budget .
but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .
" once the pressure of time becomes crucial enough , then they 'll find a solution , " he said . he added that the fact that agricultural policy would " come away unscathed is relatively annoying . " marcus bösch -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meet the eu 's deficit sinners although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .
there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . -lrb- june 14 , 2005 -rrb- eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks .

with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .

from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 leadership row leaves eads grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 stole the show in paris but all is not well behind the scenes the bitter power struggle at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has put the company in an embarrassing spot as it appears leaderless at the prestigious international paris air show this week . airbus ' new super-jumbo a380 , the world 's largest airliner , was the undisputed star of the glitzy inauguration of the weeklong aviation show at le bourget airport , north of paris , on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk past planes on the opening day of the 46th international paris air show at le bourget airport , north of paris .
but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .
-lrb- june 1 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us face off at wto in aircraft spat a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .

green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .

but , fat farm subsidies are unlikely to come under the axe and a new political direction for the struggling bloc wo n't be discussed either . days before a crucial eu summit gets underway , there seems to be no solution in sight for a growing row over the 25-member bloc 's long-term budget .
with both net payers and recipient countries refusing to give ground on their long-held positions , the situation raises the prospect of real financial gridlock on top of the political crisis sparked by two ' no ' votes to the eu constitution . the budgetary problem involves wrangling over the smallest decimal point of percentage tables , rebates and net contributions to the eu coffers .
the rumblings have eclipsed the fact that the debate on the eu budget was also meant to give the floundering bloc some political direction after the shock over the treaty rejection in france and the netherlands . wrong direction " we talk too much about the scope and quantity , too little about what the money is going to be spent on , " said friedrich heinemann , expert on eu finances at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinemann added that whether the eu budget for 2007-2013 finally amounted to a trillion euros or 800 billion euros was indeed relevant , but what was central was " the false direction as far as focusing responsibilities was concerned . " after all , it 's already clear that the main thrust of the eu 's budgetary spending is going to remain unchanged .
agricultural subsidies that were agreed upon in 2002 , will in the coming years take up more than 40 percent of the total eu budget .
taken together with spending for structural funds and aid for poorer regions , the eu 's budgetary margin will be massively squeezed , leaving little room for any other project .
money for developing a new political focus or for more leeway for trade and diplomacy on the international stage will hardly be available . losing sight of the real goals " unfortunately too little money is spent on the actual european responsibilities , european foreign policy and also on research and development , " lamented heinemann . not much is expected to change until 2013 despite documents by the eu commission filled with flowery ideas and recommendations .
for instance , brussels wants to promote research and technological development through the creation of " poles of excellence through transnational cooperation " and position the eu as a global partner . but , the " kom -lrb- 2004 -rrb- 487 " document by the commission offers a more sobering view .
from the 8.3 billion euros that are meant to flow into " foreign policy instruments " in 2007 , more than one fifth of it alone is earmarked for " market oriented spending and direct payments for agriculture . " " seems expensive … but it 's appropriate , " says a colorful information brochure given out by the agriculture department of the eu . bildunterschrift : farm in germany with sheep do n't touch those farm subsidies determined savings in agricultural policy and a tough regulation of structural policies - like heinemann demands - is out of question : the national interests of eu member states stand in the way . " instead of seeing that the unified political interests and focuses of the eu are implemented , they -lrb- the eu members states -rrb- seem to be more interested in what their own country can get from the eu , " is how the independent europe portal euractiv.com sees it . in the meantime , it remains uncertain whether eu leaders will be able to solve the budgetary tangle at the summit scheduled for june 16-17 .
" it would be a pity if it did n't come to that , " said eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . but , heinemann knows the way the eu works .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.06.2005 schröder wants stem cell laws eased großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few scientists are allowed to do research on stem cells in germany a day after italians rejected easing their prohibitive law on fertility and bioethics , chancellor gerhard schröder declared that germany should liberalize its own restrictive legislation on stem cell research . " we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .
" veiled cannibalism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder fears germany could fall behind but politicians from the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrat 's junior coalition partner , the greens , criticized the chancellor 's comments . the right to life of an embryo must be respected despite the scientific and economic successes that stem cell research promises , cdu parliamentarian thomas rachel demanded .
green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .
1 , 2002 .
they must also have been developed from artificially created embryos that were originally meant for pregnancy and not for research . schröder has in the past said he was in favor of liberalizing the legislation , though not publicly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.06.2005 a blunder waiting to happen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah connor blamed nerves for her anthem mix-up a series of screw-ups by singers performing the german national anthem has reignited a touchy debate about german patriotism , or lack thereof . most americans can reel off the words to " the star-spangled banner " with nary a second thought .
even cool britons can mouth along to " god save the queen " or " rule britannia . "
but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand . " rondine 's blunder-filled rendition came just days after german pop star sarah connor had a similarly humiliating experience at the opening of a new sports arena in munich before almost 10 million television viewers . when it came time for the line " blossom in the glow of this happiness , " the 25-year-old performer floundered and instead sang : " brew in light of this happiness . " connor apologized for the mix-up .
but in germany , it has only had the effect of endearing her even more to her legions of young fans , who do n't know or do n't care to know the words of their national anthem . even the federal environment minister , jürgen trittin , once boasted that he has never sung the national anthem and has no plans to ever sing it . contentious lyrics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian composer joseph haydn composed the melody for " das deutschlandlied " admittedly , the song has a thorny history .
though " das deutschlandlied " has been the german anthem since 1922 , its first line , " deutschland , deutschland über alles , " which translates as " germany above everything , " was given sinister meaning under the rule of adolf hitler .
the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit eu attempts to untie budget tangles eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores curing the eu 's democratic deficit ? business -pipe- 14.06.2005 meet the eu 's deficit sinners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disobedient eu countries keep commissioner almunia busy although repeatedly cited for failure to rein in deficit spending , germany and france are by no means the only violaters of eu deficit guidelines .
there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .
the federal cartel office , germany 's competition watchdog , said it was investigating the simultaneous cancellation by all four airlines of their commission contracts with travel agents .
the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .
air berlin , has said it would follow lufthansa 's example and sell tickets to agents without any commission , leaving it up to the agents whether to mark up the tickets for the customer and pocket the difference . dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .
officials also announced possible action against portugal .
-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- imf chief blasts weak eu budget rules when france and germany , chronic violators of eu budget requirements , pushed for a weakening of those rules , they hardly expected to attract imf attention .

there are at least 10 guilty members and many more awaiting a verdict . after the dutch government managed to lower its budgetary deficit from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2003 to 2.3 percent in 2004 , the eu suspended legal measures against the netherlands on june 7 .
at the same time , the eu said it was initiating disciplinary action against italy for violating the stability and growth pact by exceeding the eu 's deficit ceiling . italy italy 's public deficit reached 3.1 percent of gdp in both 2003 and 2004 , according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics office .
thus , rome twice overstepped the 3.0 deficit ceiling imposed by the eu .
the european commission has n't formally declared it will take disciplinary action against italy , but monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia made clear that the body would do so by the end of june . germany due to germany 's poor economic climate , the european commission put on ice disciplinary measures against the country .
but it 's questionable whether the respite until autumn 2005 will have helped .
even germany 's optimistic finance minister , hans eichel , has admitted that sticking to the 3.0 percent limit in 2005 will be difficult .
every year since 2002 , germany has violated the stability pact rules .
in 2004 , the budget deficit reached 3.9 percent , and the commission predicts the 2005 deficit to reach 3.3 percent of gdp .
since germany is expected to benefit from the reformed -lrb- and relaxed -rrb- stability pact rules , it 's likely that it the eu will accord it another year to consolidate its budget . france the commission has also put disciplinary action against france on hold and expects the country 's budgetary deficit to fall to 3.0 percent this year .
if paris does indeed achieve that aim , measures against france will most likely be dropped .
like germany , france has consistently violated the stability pact limit since 2002 .
in 2004 , the public deficit stood at 3.7 of gdp . greece while the commission has left germany and france room to breathe , it 's taken a hard line against greece .
the greek authorities embellished their deficit figures from 1997 to 2003 by 2.1 percent on average , circumnavigating the critical 3.0 percent ceiling again and again .
originally estimated at 5.5 percent , greece 's 2004 deficit actually reached 6.1 percent .
intensified monitoring on the part of brussels and the prospect of penalties amounting to billions of euros have had an effect though .
in april , the eu announced it would forgo sanctions against greece in view of athens ' radical belt-tightening . new members more than half of the countries the eu is monitoring for violating the budget ceiling are new members .
in 2003 , cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , malta , poland and slovakia had high deficits and have faced the prospect of disciplinary action since joining the eu in may 2004 .
although they have all succeeded in dramatically reducing their deficits - the czech deficit dropped from 11.7 in 2003 to 3.0 in 2004 - the eu 's spring forecast predicted that they would again breach the ceiling this year .
only cyprus was expected to adhere to the budget criteria , with a public deficit of 2.9 percent in 2005 . portugal in late june , portugal is set to boost to 11 the number of countries being monitored for their budgetary sins .
the country expects a record deficit of 6.83 percent of gdp this year .
at that level , disciplinary action against lisbon is practically a given . torsten gellner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy , portugal face eu wrath over deficits the european commission agreed on tuesday to launch disciplinary action against italy for flouting eu budget rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.06.2005 leadership row leaves eads grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 stole the show in paris but all is not well behind the scenes the bitter power struggle at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has put the company in an embarrassing spot as it appears leaderless at the prestigious international paris air show this week . airbus ' new super-jumbo a380 , the world 's largest airliner , was the undisputed star of the glitzy inauguration of the weeklong aviation show at le bourget airport , north of paris , on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk past planes on the opening day of the 46th international paris air show at le bourget airport , north of paris .
but , the festive mood did n't seem to lift the flagging spirits of airbus employees .
the fulsome praise - " a european success " - showered by french president chirac after a visit aboard the a380 seemed strangely out of place in face of a persisting and damaging battle for the reins of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its subsidiary , airbus . the embattled eads company even canceled a news conference scheduled tuesday at the air show .
the move amounts to an embarrassing admittance of a strategic deadlock at the company , considered a showpiece for the european aviation industry . eads in disarray eads has been in disarray after failing to install its two new chief executives , frenchman noel forgeard and german thoman enders , due to internal strife .
the conflict first broke when airbus chief forgeard tried to end the dual leadership of the french-german eads last year and take over the reins alone . forgeard initially was supported by french president chirac but german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , the main german shareholder who has a 30-percent stake in eads and thus the same as the french lagardere group and the french government , blocked the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard , left , with german chancellor and a german delegation with the a380 establishing two co-leaders was intended to end the crisis .
but , forgeard and enders have been waiting weeks for their confirmation as co-bosses while eads in the meantime is led temporarily by members of its supervisory board . the main shareholders are unable to decide on the question of succession . the conflict has also blocked the nomination of a successor to forgeard as ceo at eads subsidiary airbus .
" no decision would happen during the show , " an informed source told afp . wrangling over business deals meanwhile , criticism of noel forgeard is growing louder for providing the trigger for the current crisis , with his move to take over the eads helm at the end of last year .
even president chirac , who has backed forgeard so far , is apparently distancing himself from his former consultant in the face of the political fallout . according to aviation industry experts , rumors in paris suggest that forgeard may retain his position as airbus head while another french national would be nominated to the eads co-leadership instead . but , the crisis in eads is n't confined to a struggle for the top spot .
shareholders are also wrangling over whether eads should take over important suppliers such as the electronics giant thales .
forgeard and chirac are said to be in favor while daimlerchrysler has ruled out a complete fusion which would lead to the french acquiring a larger chunk of shares in eads . eads entangled in subsides row with boeing what 's clear however is that eads can not afford such a damaging power struggle in its ranks at a time when it is preoccupied with a subsidies dispute with archrival boeing . washington has accused the eu of violating trade laws by subsidizing the airbus project .
the europeans argue that the us government subsidizes boeing through billion-strong arms contracts , among other things .
both the us and the eu have filed complaints with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and the trade body is to begin looking at them this week .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson is already expecting " the biggest , trickiest and most expensive legal dispute in the history of the wto . " eads might take some small comfort from the fact that boeing does n't exactly have a stable leadership at present itself .
the us aviation giant has been looking for a successor to harry stonecipher , its ceo who was forced out for having had a " personal relationship " with a female executive in the company .
but , as opposed to eads , boeing might solve its personnel problems more easily with successor alan mulally already getting ready for the job . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france . what is more worrying for eads is that its us rival 's order book is already fatter than that of airbus , thanks to the 787 , boeing 's first new model in 10 years , due to enter service in 2008 .
last year airbus outstripped boeing orders 370 to 277 . the 787 , with 250 seats , has already attracted 266 firm orders and options from carriers seduced by its fuel efficiency .
airbus plans to strike back with the a350 , a technologically advanced version of the a330 due to enter service in 2010 . there was some light at the end of the tunnel for embattled eads on the first day of the paris air show however : qatar airways announced it planned to buy 60 models of the a350 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .
-lrb- june 1 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us face off at wto in aircraft spat a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .

" we must not disconnect ourselves from progress in international research in biotechnology and genetic engineering , " schröder said .
the chancellor made his remarks after receiving an honorary doctorate from the biology department at the university of göttingen on tuesday . schröder called for " research without fetters but not without borders . "
he said the research methods should be explored as long as the medical potential of research with adult and embryonic stem cells had n't been exhausted and the chance to fight incurable diseases remained . the chancellor also stood up for stem cell researchers ' moral integrity and said it was arrogant to cast doubt on the scientists ' motives .
he stressed that the controversial issue should be dealt with in a broad social dialogue . a large number of germans - 40.6 percent - are in favor of easing restrictions on research on stem cells from embryos , according to a recent survey .
just over 28 percent told the wahlen research group they opposed loosening the legislation , while the rest were undecided .
" veiled cannibalism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder fears germany could fall behind but politicians from the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrat 's junior coalition partner , the greens , criticized the chancellor 's comments . the right to life of an embryo must be respected despite the scientific and economic successes that stem cell research promises , cdu parliamentarian thomas rachel demanded .
green party parliamentarian volker beck called the use of embryos for embryonic stem cells " veiled cannibalism . "
it must remain banned , he said .
according to social democrat ethics expert rene röspel , schröder 's remarks merely reflected the chancellor 's personal opinion . the 2002 law prohibits the production of human embryonic stem cells in germany and imposes very limited conditions under which researchers may import them .
cells may only be used from cultures that have existed since jan .
1 , 2002 .
they must also have been developed from artificially created embryos that were originally meant for pregnancy and not for research . schröder has in the past said he was in favor of liberalizing the legislation , though not publicly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

even cool britons can mouth along to " god save the queen " or " rule britannia . "
but few germans can recite the lyrics to " das deutschlandlied , " much less sing it properly . what 's worse , even professional singers whose job it is to perform the anthem at special occasions and sports events ca n't seem to get it right , either . the german-italian tenor luciano rondine left them rolling in the aisles when he flubbed his way through the german anthem before a recent basketball championship match . " i had a complete blackout , " rondine said after improvising lines such as " with unhappiness and refuge " when he was meant to sing " brotherly with heart and hand . " rondine 's blunder-filled rendition came just days after german pop star sarah connor had a similarly humiliating experience at the opening of a new sports arena in munich before almost 10 million television viewers . when it came time for the line " blossom in the glow of this happiness , " the 25-year-old performer floundered and instead sang : " brew in light of this happiness . " connor apologized for the mix-up .
but in germany , it has only had the effect of endearing her even more to her legions of young fans , who do n't know or do n't care to know the words of their national anthem . even the federal environment minister , jürgen trittin , once boasted that he has never sung the national anthem and has no plans to ever sing it . contentious lyrics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian composer joseph haydn composed the melody for " das deutschlandlied " admittedly , the song has a thorny history .
though " das deutschlandlied " has been the german anthem since 1922 , its first line , " deutschland , deutschland über alles , " which translates as " germany above everything , " was given sinister meaning under the rule of adolf hitler .
the first stanza is now outlawed in germany . but it seems that , 60 years after world war ii , germans still have n't warmed to " das deutschlandlied " - a fact bemoaned by proponents of a national movement to boost a healthy sense of patriotism in young germans . they can take heart , however , in the knowledge that there will be no stumbling or fumbling for words when the anthem is sung during the confederations cup soccer championships which get underway in germany on wednesday .

ltu , condor , hapagfly and air berlin all confirmed their offices had been searched .

the office suspected the airlines planned to reduce or cancel altogether the commission that travel agents took on sales of their carriers ' tickets .
the airlines dismissed the allegations and said they had nothing to fear from the probe . the current commission system has been called into question after german carrier lufthansa announced last september it would cancel commission on tickets sold by travel agencies .

but it could have been far worse .
blood donations helped save heather 's life - and now she 's launching a campaign to recruit more blood donors .
lady heather mills mccartney dropped into the breakfast studio to tell us more about her campaign to recruit more blood donors the national blood service needs around 8,000 donations a day to keep the nhs supplied with blood in england and wales alone .
each donation is given completely voluntarily - and there 's no payment involved , apart from a cup of tea and a biscuit for the donor .
at the moment , only around 6 % of eligible adults in the uk are donors - that 's around 1.3m people .
between them , they gave 2.3m donations last year .
the national blood service is launching a drive to recruit more donors .
in principle , anyone can give blood between the ages of 17 and 60 .

kim woo-choong , 69 , landed near seoul on an early morning flight from vietnam and was immediately arrested by police .
he fled abroad six years ago after his business empire , once a symbol of the country 's economic success , crashed with debts of more than $ 70bn -lrb- £ 38bn -rrb- .
seven other former daewoo executives have been found guilty of fraud .
mr kim is facing similar charges .
" i lower my head deeply down and apologise for having caused troubles to people over the daewoo group problem , " he said in a written statement issued upon his arrival at incheon international airport from hanoi .
i will take whatever responsibility i am supposed to take over the daewoo group incident kim woo-choong ex-daewoo chairman 's gamble " i will take whatever responsibility i am supposed to take over the daewoo group incident .
i feel deeply sorry , " he told reporters as he was taken away under police escort .
' accounting fraud ' mr kim 's whereabouts have been a mystery , though there have been reports of him living in vietnam and europe .
he was once revered by koreans as a symbol of their country 's rapid economic growth , says the bbc 's charles scanlon in seoul .
he bought a small textile company in the late 1960s , and three decades later had built south korea 's second largest industrial conglomerate .
it made cars , ships and electronics products , and had factories around the world .
but the group came crashing down six years ago in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis .
mr kim is alleged to have resorted to massive accounting fraud to try to prop up his ailing empire .
our correspondent says his return is seen as a test of the government 's commitment to clean up notoriously lax corporate governance .
in the past , he says , it has given lenient treatment to businessmen convicted of fraud .

he bought a small textile company in the late 1960s , and three decades later had built south korea 's second largest industrial conglomerate .
it made cars , ships and electronics products , and had factories around the world .
but the group came crashing down six years ago in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis .
mr kim is alleged to have resorted to massive accounting fraud to try to prop up his ailing empire .
our correspondent says his return is seen as a test of the government 's commitment to clean up notoriously lax corporate governance .
in the past , he says , it has given lenient treatment to businessmen convicted of fraud .

lucy sullivan was withdrawn from whitemill special school in carmarthen three weeks ago .
her parents have said they will try to provide for her at home .
carmarthenshire local education authority said it had tried to work with the family and that keeping lucy from school was not to her advantage .
' very stressful ' the dispute centres on how the special needs listed on lucy 's statement - a document outlining what provision she should receive - are met .
according to lucy 's father , steven sullivan , his daughter should receive weekly speech therapy and hydrotherapy and should have been provided with a computerised device to help her communicate .
steven sullivan claims lucy 's needs are not being met mr sullivan claims that carmarthenshire nhs trust failed to provide the speech therapy and hydrotherapy , while the special communication device was not provided by the lea .
mr sullivan said : " it 's got so frustrating that i 've taken her out of school because i 've got to get something done .
" it 's been very stressful .
we did n't just turn round and say ' i 'm taking lucy out of school ' .
" we spoke about it as a family and said it 's the only way forward .
" on the statement it says lucy 's to receive hydrotherapy on a weekly basis , speech therapy on a weekly basis and she 's supposed to have a communication aid .
" at the present time she 's receiving none of this .
' issues of concern ' " it would n't be in her statement if she did n't need it .
" i think she 's better off at home at the moment - i 'll keep her here until everything 's in place on the school . "
carmarthenshire lea said it had tried for some time to work with the sullivan family on updating lucy 's statement .
the lea said : " we have sought for some time to work with the family on updating the statement of special educational need which we have inherited from another authority , but have so far failed to agree on its content .
" there would seem to be three specific issues which are of concern .
" they include two which are not within the remit of the education authority to resolve since they are included in the non-educational area of the statement of special need .
" the third issue revolves around the suitability of a piece of equipment and the current position is that we have acted on expert advice , although we recognise that this is not in keeping with the father 's view .
" nevertheless we can not see how keeping the pupil away from school is to anyone 's advantage at this stage .
" we are anxious that a speedy solution can be found which will ensure that this young lady can return to school . "
carmarthenshire nhs trust added in a statement : " the trust is in discussion with the local education authority with a view to finalising this matter . "

ospreys were hunted to extinction in 19th century england .
four years ago england was in the grip of foot-and-mouth disease which saw the slaughter of millions of animals .
at its height in april 2001 , the lake district was one of the worst hit areas with more than 3,000 farmers losing livestock worth more than £ 200m .
restrictions were imposed to halt the spread of the disease and the countryside became almost a no-go area .
but in the midst of all the suffering a small project was under way which helped to save tourism in cumbria .
a team of volunteers from the rspb , the forestry commission and the lake district national park authority joined forces to help repopulate the county and ultimately england , with a once common bird of prey - the osprey .
the team had already had its first success after a pair of the birds nested on a purpose-built platform in the forest overlooking lake bassenthwaite .
site made public the decision was made to go public with the location of the nest in april of that year , and a viewpoint was set up across the lake at dodd wood .
crucially , it was not constructed on farmland , which meant visitors were allowed to come and go freely .
by the end of the season in august more than 100,000 people had flocked to see the site .
over 100,000 people flocked to dodd wood in its first year .
according to project member , jill damment , the effect on the devastated local economy was phenomenal .
she recalls : " it 's fair to say that those two ospreys saved a lot of businesses .
depression in the area was high and hundreds of guesthouses were closing down because of the restrictions on visitors .
" the cafe at the bottom of the hill had n't seen a single customer in two months , but as soon as the osprey project took off they were inundated . "
that year , the birds mated successfully , the first chick hatched and was raised and all three migrated to africa for the winter .
as is usual for young ospreys , the first chick never returned to the nest at bassenthwaite , but the mating pair did - and have since raised seven more chicks .
adam hansen works with the osprey project at its second site , the nearby whinlatter visitor centre , where live images from the osprey nest are beamed to a large-screen television .
whinlatter boasts a live webcam link to the osprey 's nest .
he says hopes are high that a second pair will soon nest in the region .
" it 's uncommon for the female chicks to ever return to the region , but hopefully one of the males will soon come back and attract a mate .
" a similar project in scotland has been a resounding success and they now have 150 nesting pairs .
" we 've probably got this pair for a maximum of nine more years .
by then we 're hoping that some of the males will have returned .
" they usually spend two to three years in africa so we 're constantly on the lookout for new arrivals . "
and the source of such fresh blood could be quite close to home , thanks to a colony of ospreys just over the scottish border in dumfries and galloway .
fingers crossed , say the birdwatchers , for this groundbreaking conservation project , born in the shadow of foot-and-mouth disease .

" it 's uncommon for the female chicks to ever return to the region , but hopefully one of the males will soon come back and attract a mate .
" a similar project in scotland has been a resounding success and they now have 150 nesting pairs .
" we 've probably got this pair for a maximum of nine more years .
by then we 're hoping that some of the males will have returned .
" they usually spend two to three years in africa so we 're constantly on the lookout for new arrivals . "
and the source of such fresh blood could be quite close to home , thanks to a colony of ospreys just over the scottish border in dumfries and galloway .
fingers crossed , say the birdwatchers , for this groundbreaking conservation project , born in the shadow of foot-and-mouth disease .

ospreys were hunted to extinction in 19th century england .
four years ago england was in the grip of foot-and-mouth disease which saw the slaughter of millions of animals .
at its height in april 2001 , the lake district was one of the worst hit areas with more than 3,000 farmers losing livestock worth more than £ 200m .
restrictions were imposed to halt the spread of the disease and the countryside became almost a no-go area .
but in the midst of all the suffering a small project was under way which helped to save tourism in cumbria .
a team of volunteers from the rspb , the forestry commission and the lake district national park authority joined forces to help repopulate the county and ultimately england , with a once common bird of prey - the osprey .
the team had already had its first success after a pair of the birds nested on a purpose-built platform in the forest overlooking lake bassenthwaite .
site made public the decision was made to go public with the location of the nest in april of that year , and a viewpoint was set up across the lake at dodd wood .
crucially , it was not constructed on farmland , which meant visitors were allowed to come and go freely .

ospreys were hunted to extinction in 19th century england .
four years ago england was in the grip of foot-and-mouth disease which saw the slaughter of millions of animals .
at its height in april 2001 , the lake district was one of the worst hit areas with more than 3,000 farmers losing livestock worth more than £ 200m .
restrictions were imposed to halt the spread of the disease and the countryside became almost a no-go area .
but in the midst of all the suffering a small project was under way which helped to save tourism in cumbria .
a team of volunteers from the rspb , the forestry commission and the lake district national park authority joined forces to help repopulate the county and ultimately england , with a once common bird of prey - the osprey .
the team had already had its first success after a pair of the birds nested on a purpose-built platform in the forest overlooking lake bassenthwaite .
site made public the decision was made to go public with the location of the nest in april of that year , and a viewpoint was set up across the lake at dodd wood .
crucially , it was not constructed on farmland , which meant visitors were allowed to come and go freely .
by the end of the season in august more than 100,000 people had flocked to see the site .
over 100,000 people flocked to dodd wood in its first year .
according to project member , jill damment , the effect on the devastated local economy was phenomenal .
she recalls : " it 's fair to say that those two ospreys saved a lot of businesses .
depression in the area was high and hundreds of guesthouses were closing down because of the restrictions on visitors .
" the cafe at the bottom of the hill had n't seen a single customer in two months , but as soon as the osprey project took off they were inundated . "
that year , the birds mated successfully , the first chick hatched and was raised and all three migrated to africa for the winter .
as is usual for young ospreys , the first chick never returned to the nest at bassenthwaite , but the mating pair did - and have since raised seven more chicks .
adam hansen works with the osprey project at its second site , the nearby whinlatter visitor centre , where live images from the osprey nest are beamed to a large-screen television .
whinlatter boasts a live webcam link to the osprey 's nest .
he says hopes are high that a second pair will soon nest in the region .
" it 's uncommon for the female chicks to ever return to the region , but hopefully one of the males will soon come back and attract a mate .
" a similar project in scotland has been a resounding success and they now have 150 nesting pairs .
" we 've probably got this pair for a maximum of nine more years .
by then we 're hoping that some of the males will have returned .
" they usually spend two to three years in africa so we 're constantly on the lookout for new arrivals . "
and the source of such fresh blood could be quite close to home , thanks to a colony of ospreys just over the scottish border in dumfries and galloway .
fingers crossed , say the birdwatchers , for this groundbreaking conservation project , born in the shadow of foot-and-mouth disease .

a bbc wales investigation reveals that in wales one in five people have sought help to find a partner .
the week in week out programme 's survey found that of 3m people in wales , 45 % are single .
the lengths to which they go to find a date are revealed on bbc one wales on tuesday , 14 june , at 2235 bst .
to help researchers with their investigation , week in week out enlisted the help of two " guinea pigs " , chris seal from cardiff and anna gardner from newport .
the two agreed to advertise their love for sale by having huge posters of their faces plastered on a billboard on a busy street in newport .
tuesday 's programme reveals the level of success they had .
the programme questioned 800 people and also called on dating expert henry enos , a lecturer at the university of glamorgan , to analyse the results .
he says employing outside help to look for a partner is nothing new .
" around the mid 1700s there were the first newspaper adverts of dating , and in america , the early 1800s , " he said .
" we 've had forms of mediated dating historically through all cultures , that was formalised , or match-makers .
today people are just using modern dating methods , and using media to mediate their dating experiences . "
sometimes romance needs a little help according to the survey , more than 20 % of the population in wales have used some form of mediated dating so , chances are , everyone knows someone - maybe a family member , a neighbour , or a friend - who has used one of these methods .
with those questioned for the programme , the most popular way of meeting a potential partner was through a blind date , followed by online dating and speed dating as equal second , then newspaper adverts .
the programme asks why increasing numbers of people are turning to outside help to find a partner .
it found the main reason is having a busy lifestyle , the idea has been recommended to them , they lack confidence , feel shy , or lived in a too small a community .
clive worth from pontyates , llanelli , tells the programme he has had his share of success since receiving help .
" i 'd never had so many women wanting to meet me , " he said .
" all of a sudden i had about 30-odd women wanting to meet me .
i was never short of dates and the dates started flooding in .
within five years i 've had over 300 dates . "
week in week out also looks at another feature of modern life - long-distance relationships sparked off via the internet .
richie jenkins and diane donaldson from newport first met online three years ago .
ritchie flew all the way to canada to meet diane , who was living in canada at the time .
they fell in love , she moved to wales , and they have been together ever since .

back in the 1700s , wales was known for its cider production but , over the centuries , the west country took over as the main producer .
but the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- believes welsh cider brewers are now making a welcome comeback .
gwynt y ddraig from llantwit fardre , south wales , and ralph 's 3bs cider , from powys , have won two top awards .
gwynt y ddraig - or dragon 's wind - won a gold medal at the reading beer and cider festival for its perry last month , and ralph 's 3bs , from new radnor , received a gold for its cider .
gwynt y draig took the award for the best cider last year .

mr owen , 52 , said : " since our gold medal at the festival our sales have gone up by 10 % . "
he added that he brewed about 7,000 litres a year and also held the welsh cider title .
gwynt y ddraig brewers andrew gronow and his uncle bill george have been cider producers for just five years .
mr george , 52 , said : " we 're looking to boost production later this year from about 8,000 litres to about 22,000 litres .

back in the 1700s , wales was known for its cider production but , over the centuries , the west country took over as the main producer .
but the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- believes welsh cider brewers are now making a welcome comeback .
gwynt y ddraig from llantwit fardre , south wales , and ralph 's 3bs cider , from powys , have won two top awards .
gwynt y ddraig - or dragon 's wind - won a gold medal at the reading beer and cider festival for its perry last month , and ralph 's 3bs , from new radnor , received a gold for its cider .
gwynt y draig took the award for the best cider last year . "
you could say that wales is becoming one of europe 's top cider and perry producers " rhys jones , camra since their success at camra 's showpiece , both companies have reported improved sales .
the campaign 's cider spokesman in wales , rhys jones , said : " i suppose you could say that wales is becoming one of europe 's top cider and perry producers .
" generally , england and wales are traditional cider makers , but good results from welsh producers recently have been impressive . "
the english counties of herefordshire , somerset , and gloucestershire have been more closely associated with cider production in more recent times , he added .
" more people have become involved in cider recently and many small breweries now exist .
they 've found that the quality and taste of welsh cider is still there , " mr jones said .
gillian williams , camra 's director of cider and perry campaigning , said wales was " re-awakening its past " as a cider maker after it was renowned as a producer in the 16th and 17th century .
ralph owen 's 3bs cider had tremendous character and depth , said the festival 's judges .
mr owen , 52 , said : " since our gold medal at the festival our sales have gone up by 10 % . "
he added that he brewed about 7,000 litres a year and also held the welsh cider title .
gwynt y ddraig brewers andrew gronow and his uncle bill george have been cider producers for just five years .
mr george , 52 , said : " we 're looking to boost production later this year from about 8,000 litres to about 22,000 litres .
" since our success last year and this year we 've noticed an increase in sales and people wanting our cider and perry .
welsh cider is clearly making an impression . "

the share price drop came as northwest withdrew a $ 50 price rise on fares for business travellers after rivals failed to match it .
the climbdown was a sign that northwest lacks the clout to have pricing power .
but investors were also said to be worried by slow restructuring talks , and by the chairman 's share sales .
the airline 's chairman , gary wilson , has sold 59 % of his personal shareholding in northwest since mid-may .
the share sales have been publicly documented in compulsory filings with the us securities and exchange commission .
cost-cutting the airline 's chief executive doug steenland last week said its pension costs were unmanageably high and could force it to file for bankruptcy protection , reuters reported .
northwest is battling to find $ 950m in savings and is in talks with its unions over restructuring .
it cut nearly 5,000 jobs in 2003 , and last year pilots agreed to a 15 % pay cut .
it is not the only us airline that is struggling commercially .
us airways , for instance , has sought bankruptcy protection twice in two years .
the overcrowded us airline industry was suffering from poor profitability and pressure from budget airlines before the 11 september attacks pushed it into crisis and triggered a wave of restructuring .
since then , oil price rises have added to pressure on the airlines ' profits .
a wall street journal report on the state of northwest 's finances is said to have helped trigger the sell-off .
" there 's no new news , " said calyon securities airline analyst ray neidl , putting northwest 's chances of avoiding bankruptcy protection at " better than 50/50 " .
northwest 's shares finished 11.9 % lower on monday at $ 5.58 .
