it marks the end of an era for many berliners . it is not a large , nor particularly elegant place , nothing on the scale of new york 's grand central or paris ' gare du nord .
there are only four railway platforms , one sit-down restaurant that has seen better days , a few fast-food counters and shops , and a permanent presence of homeless people , beggars , and prostitutes mixed in with the travelers and tourists . despite its lack of glamour , zoo station -lrb- officially bahnhof zoologischer garten , or shorter , bahnhof zoo -rrb- has a treasured place in the hearts of many berliners and the decision to take away its status next year as a primary stop for long-distance trains arriving in the german capital has many mourning what they see as the final dénouement of a legend that played a central role in the divided city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the almost three decades that the berlin wall separated two different political philosophies , not to mention neighbors , zoo station was the western sector 's main train terminal , despite its small size .
it came to almost represent the small island of democracy and capitalism in the socialist east german sea . " the symbolic power of the station is very strong , " said manuela damianakis , a spokesperson for berlin 's planning office .
" it was one of the most important parts of the city , especially since it was the arrival point for visitors from the west . " with the berlin wall 's construction , berlin 's traditional center , the neighborhood of mitte , was cut off from the west .
a new center developed , with its focus around zoo station and the kaiser wilhelm memorial church .
it served as a capitalist counterpoint to the socialist city center at alexanderplatz in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoping time - the kurfuerstendamm boulevard in western berlin just a block away from the station begins the elegant kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the europa center shopping mall is a stone 's throw away as is the huge kadewe department store .
movie theaters and popular discos are also nearby . " there is something mythic about the station , because it was at the very heart of west berlin life for so many years , " said damianakis . disaffected youth but zoo station did not just represent the glitzy side of life in the fishbowl that was on the front lines of the cold war .
the station was also a magnet for the disaffected youth who hinted at a darker side of postwar west germany 's economic prosperity . berlin was often a destination for young people who wanted to escape the constraints of west german middle-class smugness .
zoo station , in turn , often caught those who fell victim to some of the excesses of these alternative lifestyles .
in the 1970s and 80s , it became known as a gathering place for drop-outs and punks .
the street running along the back of the station , jebensstrasse , became notorious for its prostitution and drug scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that world was documented in a biographical film called " we children from bahnhof zoo . "
based on a biography by christiane felscherinow , it recounts the descent of a teenage young girl into a vortex of drugs and sex for hire , all from the perspective of her and her friends .
the film used the station and its environs as a gritty , hopeless backdrop . in the 1990s , the city stepped in to try and rid the station of its more undesirable elements and improve the atmosphere for the many tourists and commuters who pass through every day .
police patrols were stepped up and in the mid-90s , much of the station was renovated . however , it still serves as a gathering place for the homeless , and teenage prostitutes still ply their trade behind the station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hagen the station has been the topic of books , songs by artists like u2 and nina hagen -lrb- photo -rrb- and a popular musical , called " line 1 , " which tells the story of a west german girl arriving at zoo station to experience life and love in the big city . history zoo station was originally opened in 1882 , but was not a railway station , rather handled traffic for the city 's stadtbahn , or municipal light-rail system .
two years later , long-distance trains began running through the station . in 1902 , the first subway line in berlin , the east-west u2 line , began operation at zoo station .
in the 1930s , a new commuter train , or s-bahn , hall was constructed and the railway hall was expanded .
and in 1961 , the year the berlin wall was built , the north-south u9 subway line also began running through bahnhof zoo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bahnhof zoologischer garten in berlin , aufgenommen im juli 1946 .
foto : landesbildstelle berlin the station had been damaged in the bombing of berlin during wwii and during the final battle for the german capital .
it only reopened for both s-bahn and long-distance trains in 1955 . loss of stature although the station has bounced back from bombs and rehabilitated itself , partially , from its image as the center of berlin 's drug culture , it appears that it will finally fall victim to german reunification . when the wall fell , berlin 's center of gravity shifted back to where it originally was , to the neighborhood of mitte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed train in front of the reichstag zoo station began to lose some of its importance and with last week 's decision by german rail to strike the station from its list of stops for long-distance and high-speed trains , its fate appears to be sealed .
zoo station will return to its original role as one district station among others . but it 's not going down without a fight .
emotions have been running high since german rail announced its decision and monika thiemen , district mayor , is lobbying to maintain the station as a western hub . " we do not agree with this decision and want german rail to reconsider , " she said .
" it 's not right that the trains ca n't make just a four-minute stop that makes the lives of citizens here so much easier . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehrter bahnhof , berlin 's soon-to-be-complete central train station another resident , helga fischer , is starting a citizen 's initiative to save the station .
she ca n't understand german rail 's decision to have some trains simply bypass zoo station for berlin 's new central train station further east , lehrter bahnhof -lrb- photo -rrb- . " it 's simply idiotic to stop having long-distance trains there just before the soccer world cup next year , " she said .
" it 's going to affect local business , increase traffic on the streets , and it 's caused a great deal of outrage here . " indeed , the daily tagesspiegel , mostly read in the west , notes that it has received more letters protesting the changes to the station than it has for almost any other municipal issue that has surfaced in berlin .
on the contrary , readers of the berliner zeitung , a daily read primarily in the east , have hardly made a peep . perhaps the band u2 summed it up well , and presciently , in their song zoo station from the early 90s . time is a train makes the future the past leaves you standing in the station your face pressed up against the glass the train has left the station . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still derailed over train harmony the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .
any improvements will be seen as progress after such dismal report cards over the past few years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

berliners can dust off their dancing shoes - it 's really happening .
after much speculation , the family of exonerated pop star michael jackson will hold a reunion in the german capital .
and they 've got lots to celebrate . not long after being acquitted of child sex abuse charges , michael jackson flew to bahrain to relax .
now , though , it 's time to party .
and for that , the king of pop looks set to join the rest of his family in berlin , where a party is being planned on july 22 to thank european fans who stood by the singer during his trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joe jackson the family has an additional reason to celebrate , as patriarch joe jackson marks his 76th birthday that same weekend . " this is of course a very special occasion for us , " said a spokeswoman from berlin 's estrel hotel , confirming the rumors of a berlin comeback for jackson . but - lest the gloved one 's german fans rejoice too soon - it 's not yet 100 percent certain that michael will be attending his own party .
" one ca n't know that for sure , " said a spokesperson from the ricercar agency , which is helping to organize the fete . the invitation list also appears to be open , as between 1,000 and 2,000 guests are expected , among them the jackson siblings la toya , jermaine and janet . blame it on berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael jackson dangles his baby son , prince michael ii , over the balcony of his room at berlin 's adlon hotel .
chances are good , though , that younger brother michael will show , as berlin has a special effect on the performer .
during an infamous 2002 visit , michael , a guest at the city 's posh adlon hotel , reported being so overcome by the " excitement of the moment " that he dangled his baby son over his fourth-floor balcony .
it 's a moment few of the onlookers below are likely to have forgotten , either . there 's no telling what exciting moments jackson 's upcoming visit might bring - no details about the weekend 's program have been released so far . but according to reports in the berliner zeitung daily , the family might enjoy a blast from the past as they revisit their disco roots .
papa joe jackson is said to be eyeing berlin as the location for a new nightclub modelled on new york 's legendary studio 54 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de studio 54 nightclub goes german relations between germany and the usa may be cold , but they could warm up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2005 germany assesses its education reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has germany learnt its lessons from the pisa studies ?
on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .
any improvements will be seen as progress after such dismal report cards over the past few years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

it marks the end of an era for many berliners . it is not a large , nor particularly elegant place , nothing on the scale of new york 's grand central or paris ' gare du nord .
there are only four railway platforms , one sit-down restaurant that has seen better days , a few fast-food counters and shops , and a permanent presence of homeless people , beggars , and prostitutes mixed in with the travelers and tourists . despite its lack of glamour , zoo station -lrb- officially bahnhof zoologischer garten , or shorter , bahnhof zoo -rrb- has a treasured place in the hearts of many berliners and the decision to take away its status next year as a primary stop for long-distance trains arriving in the german capital has many mourning what they see as the final dénouement of a legend that played a central role in the divided city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the almost three decades that the berlin wall separated two different political philosophies , not to mention neighbors , zoo station was the western sector 's main train terminal , despite its small size .
it came to almost represent the small island of democracy and capitalism in the socialist east german sea . " the symbolic power of the station is very strong , " said manuela damianakis , a spokesperson for berlin 's planning office .
" it was one of the most important parts of the city , especially since it was the arrival point for visitors from the west . " with the berlin wall 's construction , berlin 's traditional center , the neighborhood of mitte , was cut off from the west .
a new center developed , with its focus around zoo station and the kaiser wilhelm memorial church .
it served as a capitalist counterpoint to the socialist city center at alexanderplatz in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoping time - the kurfuerstendamm boulevard in western berlin just a block away from the station begins the elegant kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the europa center shopping mall is a stone 's throw away as is the huge kadewe department store .
movie theaters and popular discos are also nearby . " there is something mythic about the station , because it was at the very heart of west berlin life for so many years , " said damianakis . disaffected youth but zoo station did not just represent the glitzy side of life in the fishbowl that was on the front lines of the cold war .
the station was also a magnet for the disaffected youth who hinted at a darker side of postwar west germany 's economic prosperity . berlin was often a destination for young people who wanted to escape the constraints of west german middle-class smugness .
zoo station , in turn , often caught those who fell victim to some of the excesses of these alternative lifestyles .
in the 1970s and 80s , it became known as a gathering place for drop-outs and punks .
the street running along the back of the station , jebensstrasse , became notorious for its prostitution and drug scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that world was documented in a biographical film called " we children from bahnhof zoo . "
based on a biography by christiane felscherinow , it recounts the descent of a teenage young girl into a vortex of drugs and sex for hire , all from the perspective of her and her friends .
the film used the station and its environs as a gritty , hopeless backdrop . in the 1990s , the city stepped in to try and rid the station of its more undesirable elements and improve the atmosphere for the many tourists and commuters who pass through every day .
police patrols were stepped up and in the mid-90s , much of the station was renovated . however , it still serves as a gathering place for the homeless , and teenage prostitutes still ply their trade behind the station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hagen the station has been the topic of books , songs by artists like u2 and nina hagen -lrb- photo -rrb- and a popular musical , called " line 1 , " which tells the story of a west german girl arriving at zoo station to experience life and love in the big city . history zoo station was originally opened in 1882 , but was not a railway station , rather handled traffic for the city 's stadtbahn , or municipal light-rail system .
two years later , long-distance trains began running through the station . in 1902 , the first subway line in berlin , the east-west u2 line , began operation at zoo station .
in the 1930s , a new commuter train , or s-bahn , hall was constructed and the railway hall was expanded .
and in 1961 , the year the berlin wall was built , the north-south u9 subway line also began running through bahnhof zoo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bahnhof zoologischer garten in berlin , aufgenommen im juli 1946 .

it only reopened for both s-bahn and long-distance trains in 1955 . loss of stature although the station has bounced back from bombs and rehabilitated itself , partially , from its image as the center of berlin 's drug culture , it appears that it will finally fall victim to german reunification . when the wall fell , berlin 's center of gravity shifted back to where it originally was , to the neighborhood of mitte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed train in front of the reichstag zoo station began to lose some of its importance and with last week 's decision by german rail to strike the station from its list of stops for long-distance and high-speed trains , its fate appears to be sealed .
zoo station will return to its original role as one district station among others . but it 's not going down without a fight .
emotions have been running high since german rail announced its decision and monika thiemen , district mayor , is lobbying to maintain the station as a western hub . " we do not agree with this decision and want german rail to reconsider , " she said .
" it 's not right that the trains ca n't make just a four-minute stop that makes the lives of citizens here so much easier . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehrter bahnhof , berlin 's soon-to-be-complete central train station another resident , helga fischer , is starting a citizen 's initiative to save the station .

" it 's going to affect local business , increase traffic on the streets , and it 's caused a great deal of outrage here .

" it was one of the most important parts of the city , especially since it was the arrival point for visitors from the west . " with the berlin wall 's construction , berlin 's traditional center , the neighborhood of mitte , was cut off from the west .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .
any improvements will be seen as progress after such dismal report cards over the past few years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

the us urged the general assembly to vote against it . the g-4 plan would create six new permanent seats without veto power , including two from africa , and four non-permanent seats .
the group says this would make the body , created after world war ii , more representative of today 's geo-political situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council at un headquarters in new york at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the security council , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power . diplomats said in new york on wednesday that foreign ministers from g-4 counties hoped to meet with their counterparts from nigeria and ghana on sunday or monday .
" we are ready for consultations on the ministerial level , " one diplomat told reuters .
the g-4 argues that the africans would be the big winner by gaining two permanent council seats if the g-4 proposal was adopted . on sunday , g-4 representatives will meet with the president of the general assembly , jean ping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the diplomatic efforts bear no fruit , the four countries have another strategy ready .
they will call for a general vote on a draft resolution put forward by the au for council reform .
if the general assembly rejects the resolution , the g-4 will present its plan as a compromise option . au submits draft text the au formally submitted a draft resolution calling for six new permanent seats with veto power on the un security council , including two for africa , to the general assembly wednesday , african diplomats said .
but the draft was introduced on an individual basis by some african countries rather than on behalf of the entire african bloc , one diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier a negotiating team , mandated by the african union and led by nigerian foreign minister olu adeniji , told reporters that although africans would introduce their draft , they remained open to negotiations with other groups on rival proposals . " africa has a position which it wants to place on the record but the african union does not exclude negotiations with other groups , " said adeniji who came here to promote the african draft . the africans want a 26-member security council , with six new permanent seats with veto power , including two for africa , and five non-permanent seats , also including two for africa . third draft a so-called " united for consensus " group led by pakistan , argentina , canada , italy and mexico is circulating a third draft asking for 10 new non-permanent council members who would be elected for two years as is the case at present , but with the possibility of immediate re-election . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan . now or never german foreign minister joschka fischer hit back wednesday at us opposition to the g-4 proposal saying washington must decide now if it wants un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , shakes hands with israeli prime minister ariel sharon prior to their meeting at sharon 's jerusalem office on wednesday " i am very familiar with their arguments but ultimately it is a question of whether you want reform or not .
and delaying things will only lead to there being no reform , " fischer told reporters on a visit to jerusalem . fischer argued the g-4 resolution was the only proposal put forward that would bring all the underrepresented regions of the world to the table .
" only the g-4 proposal takes into account regional balance , which is an essential point , " he said , urging " calm " in the debate . but in berlin , the tone was more conciliatory .
government spokesman bela anda told a regular press briefing on wednesday that berlin remained hopeful that the g-4 resolution would be adopted . " germany remains convinced the g-4 model is fair and balanced , " government spokesperson anda told reporters .
" it 's no surprise that some nations are going to take such a strong stand , " he said when asked about washington 's position . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us rejects berlin 's un bid the united states has rejected a draft resolution by brazil , germany , india and japan seeking enlargement of the united nations security council .
washington said the proposal did not enjoy broad-based support .
-lrb- july 13 , 2005 -rrb- at 60 , un needs reform to avoid retiring the united nations came into existence 60 years ago on sunday .
as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means .

the cost-savings plan , which aims to increase group net profit by four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.83 billion -rrb- by 2008 , would come partly from a two-billion-euro improvement in sales and distribution as well as a three-billion-euro cut in material costs . another one billion euros would come from a reduction in production costs , 500 million from lower overheads as well as another 500 million in warrant costs , it said . wolfgang bernhard , the head of the volkswagen division who has a reputation as a cost-cutting specialist , warned there were " no sacred cows " in his division , which groups the volkswagen , skoda , bentley and bugatti brand names . but he sought to downplay rumours the group planned massive job cuts and factory closures following a report in the financial times deutschland on monday that the company was preparing to shut a factory in brussels with 5,700 employees . opportunity for reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the departure of hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- was seen by some analysts as an opportunity for volkswagen to push through more draconian restructuring plans . they estimate the company needs to cut about 30,000 jobs .

" that 's a tragedy for vw , because it means they can not set objectives like the toyotas , like the bmws to have a strategy which optimizes stakeholder value , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , the director of the center of automotive research at the university of applied sciences gelsenkirchen . despite the plans to reduce costs , the group vowed to continue investing and unveiled an initiative to spend 2.5 billion euros per year to improve its core passenger car business in 2006-2008 . millions paid in india hartz is the latest vw executive to bear the brunt of the growing bribery scandal , whose first tremors of the scandal came last month when the former head of personnel at vw 's skoda unit , helmuth schuster , resigned amid allegations of bribery and fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday , a top minister in india 's southern state of andhra pradesh admitted to paying money to try secure a deal with the german auto giant but denied it was a bribe . " the money was paid to vasishta wahan which we were told is an indian arm of volkswagen , " state chief minister y.s. rajasekhara reddy told reporters in this southern indian city . reddy was reacting to charges that the state government had paid 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to vasishta wahan , a shadowy company , which shares the same initials as the automaker and projected itself as the indian arm of volkswagen . vasishta wahan = vw ? the government 's dealings with volkswagen have been under a cloud after schuster quit last month amid bribery allegations and claims in german press reports that he used dummy companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably in india and angola . # b # the andhra pradesh government claims schuster -lrb- photo -rrb- " pressured " them to pay five million euros to vasitha wahan , which he claimed was volkswagen 's indian arm .

the four suspected suicide bombers , three of whom have been identified by newspapers , were also britons of pakistani origin .
uk security sources believe the mastermind was involved in previous terror operations and has links with followers of osama bin laden 's al qaeda extremist group in the united states .
he is thought to have visited the bombers in their home city of leeds , northern england , and identified targets on the london underground rail subway system where three of the four bombs exploded , the paper said .
it is thought that he was likely to have trained the recruits in how to trigger their rucksack-carried bombs , three of which went off almost simultaneously at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , at the peak of last thursday 's morning rush hour killing at least 52 people .
police have reportedly switched their investigation towards seeking the mastermind of the bombings since learning that the four bombers killed themselves in the attacks .
home secretary charles clarke said earlier wednesday that the aim was now " to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating " bombers . police are also seeking a possible fifth member of the bombers ' terror cell , who was also seen at luton station , north of london , from where the attackers traveled into the capital .
the man , also believed to be of pakistani origin , could still be at large in london , the times said .
egyptian sought police additionally want to interview an egyptian-born university lecturer who was teaching in leeds until a few weeks ago .
according to the sun newspaper , the man , who it named as 33-year-old magdi el-nashar , was studying for a biochemistry doctorate at leeds university and disappeared just before the attacks , it is thought to egypt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds , england on tuesday after officers raided residential premises in west yorkshire in connection with last week 's london bombings .
at least two of the bombers had links to his rented flat , which is one of six addresses in and around leeds raided by police on tuesday morning .
" a detailed forensic examination is expected to be carried out and may take some time to complete , " a statement from london 's metropolitan police said , adding that there had been no arrests from the raids .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .

it came to almost represent the small island of democracy and capitalism in the socialist east german sea . " the symbolic power of the station is very strong , " said manuela damianakis , a spokesperson for berlin 's planning office .
" it was one of the most important parts of the city , especially since it was the arrival point for visitors from the west . " with the berlin wall 's construction , berlin 's traditional center , the neighborhood of mitte , was cut off from the west .

the station was also a magnet for the disaffected youth who hinted at a darker side of postwar west germany 's economic prosperity . berlin was often a destination for young people who wanted to escape the constraints of west german middle-class smugness .
zoo station , in turn , often caught those who fell victim to some of the excesses of these alternative lifestyles .
in the 1970s and 80s , it became known as a gathering place for drop-outs and punks .
the street running along the back of the station , jebensstrasse , became notorious for its prostitution and drug scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that world was documented in a biographical film called " we children from bahnhof zoo . "
based on a biography by christiane felscherinow , it recounts the descent of a teenage young girl into a vortex of drugs and sex for hire , all from the perspective of her and her friends .
the film used the station and its environs as a gritty , hopeless backdrop . in the 1990s , the city stepped in to try and rid the station of its more undesirable elements and improve the atmosphere for the many tourists and commuters who pass through every day .
police patrols were stepped up and in the mid-90s , much of the station was renovated . however , it still serves as a gathering place for the homeless , and teenage prostitutes still ply their trade behind the station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hagen the station has been the topic of books , songs by artists like u2 and nina hagen -lrb- photo -rrb- and a popular musical , called " line 1 , " which tells the story of a west german girl arriving at zoo station to experience life and love in the big city . history zoo station was originally opened in 1882 , but was not a railway station , rather handled traffic for the city 's stadtbahn , or municipal light-rail system .
two years later , long-distance trains began running through the station . in 1902 , the first subway line in berlin , the east-west u2 line , began operation at zoo station .

there are only four railway platforms , one sit-down restaurant that has seen better days , a few fast-food counters and shops , and a permanent presence of homeless people , beggars , and prostitutes mixed in with the travelers and tourists . despite its lack of glamour , zoo station -lrb- officially bahnhof zoologischer garten , or shorter , bahnhof zoo -rrb- has a treasured place in the hearts of many berliners and the decision to take away its status next year as a primary stop for long-distance trains arriving in the german capital has many mourning what they see as the final dénouement of a legend that played a central role in the divided city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the almost three decades that the berlin wall separated two different political philosophies , not to mention neighbors , zoo station was the western sector 's main train terminal , despite its small size .
it came to almost represent the small island of democracy and capitalism in the socialist east german sea . " the symbolic power of the station is very strong , " said manuela damianakis , a spokesperson for berlin 's planning office .
" it was one of the most important parts of the city , especially since it was the arrival point for visitors from the west . " with the berlin wall 's construction , berlin 's traditional center , the neighborhood of mitte , was cut off from the west .
a new center developed , with its focus around zoo station and the kaiser wilhelm memorial church .
it served as a capitalist counterpoint to the socialist city center at alexanderplatz in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoping time - the kurfuerstendamm boulevard in western berlin just a block away from the station begins the elegant kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the europa center shopping mall is a stone 's throw away as is the huge kadewe department store .
movie theaters and popular discos are also nearby . " there is something mythic about the station , because it was at the very heart of west berlin life for so many years , " said damianakis . disaffected youth but zoo station did not just represent the glitzy side of life in the fishbowl that was on the front lines of the cold war .
the station was also a magnet for the disaffected youth who hinted at a darker side of postwar west germany 's economic prosperity . berlin was often a destination for young people who wanted to escape the constraints of west german middle-class smugness .
zoo station , in turn , often caught those who fell victim to some of the excesses of these alternative lifestyles .
in the 1970s and 80s , it became known as a gathering place for drop-outs and punks .
the street running along the back of the station , jebensstrasse , became notorious for its prostitution and drug scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that world was documented in a biographical film called " we children from bahnhof zoo . "
based on a biography by christiane felscherinow , it recounts the descent of a teenage young girl into a vortex of drugs and sex for hire , all from the perspective of her and her friends .
the film used the station and its environs as a gritty , hopeless backdrop . in the 1990s , the city stepped in to try and rid the station of its more undesirable elements and improve the atmosphere for the many tourists and commuters who pass through every day .
police patrols were stepped up and in the mid-90s , much of the station was renovated . however , it still serves as a gathering place for the homeless , and teenage prostitutes still ply their trade behind the station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hagen the station has been the topic of books , songs by artists like u2 and nina hagen -lrb- photo -rrb- and a popular musical , called " line 1 , " which tells the story of a west german girl arriving at zoo station to experience life and love in the big city . history zoo station was originally opened in 1882 , but was not a railway station , rather handled traffic for the city 's stadtbahn , or municipal light-rail system .
two years later , long-distance trains began running through the station . in 1902 , the first subway line in berlin , the east-west u2 line , began operation at zoo station .
in the 1930s , a new commuter train , or s-bahn , hall was constructed and the railway hall was expanded .
and in 1961 , the year the berlin wall was built , the north-south u9 subway line also began running through bahnhof zoo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bahnhof zoologischer garten in berlin , aufgenommen im juli 1946 .
foto : landesbildstelle berlin the station had been damaged in the bombing of berlin during wwii and during the final battle for the german capital .
it only reopened for both s-bahn and long-distance trains in 1955 . loss of stature although the station has bounced back from bombs and rehabilitated itself , partially , from its image as the center of berlin 's drug culture , it appears that it will finally fall victim to german reunification . when the wall fell , berlin 's center of gravity shifted back to where it originally was , to the neighborhood of mitte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed train in front of the reichstag zoo station began to lose some of its importance and with last week 's decision by german rail to strike the station from its list of stops for long-distance and high-speed trains , its fate appears to be sealed .
zoo station will return to its original role as one district station among others . but it 's not going down without a fight .
emotions have been running high since german rail announced its decision and monika thiemen , district mayor , is lobbying to maintain the station as a western hub . " we do not agree with this decision and want german rail to reconsider , " she said .
" it 's not right that the trains ca n't make just a four-minute stop that makes the lives of citizens here so much easier . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehrter bahnhof , berlin 's soon-to-be-complete central train station another resident , helga fischer , is starting a citizen 's initiative to save the station .
she ca n't understand german rail 's decision to have some trains simply bypass zoo station for berlin 's new central train station further east , lehrter bahnhof -lrb- photo -rrb- . " it 's simply idiotic to stop having long-distance trains there just before the soccer world cup next year , " she said .
" it 's going to affect local business , increase traffic on the streets , and it 's caused a great deal of outrage here . " indeed , the daily tagesspiegel , mostly read in the west , notes that it has received more letters protesting the changes to the station than it has for almost any other municipal issue that has surfaced in berlin .
on the contrary , readers of the berliner zeitung , a daily read primarily in the east , have hardly made a peep . perhaps the band u2 summed it up well , and presciently , in their song zoo station from the early 90s . time is a train makes the future the past leaves you standing in the station your face pressed up against the glass the train has left the station . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still derailed over train harmony the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .
one of those , the problems between different rail systems , raises questions over eu plans for a cohesive bloc network .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .

in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2005 vw to cut costs as hartz departs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly blue skies for vw these days vw has accepted the resignation of its personnel head in a corruption scandal and vowed to press on with cost cutting .
meanwhile , bribery allegations surface in india involving a former vw exec and a shadowy company . members of the company 's inner council , a four-member supervisory board , said they had accepted the resignation of peter hartz , tendered last friday , and that company chief executive bernd pischetsrieder would take over his responsibilities on a temporary basis . head of the ig metall trade union jürgen peters said they hoped " to reach an agreement peacefully , but quickly " on hartz 's permanent replacement . separately , management announced it would continue with an ambitious cost-cutting program aimed at improving the operating efficiency of the group , europe 's biggest car maker . last year , volkswagen 's net profits fell 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the group , which is split into two car divisions - volkswagen and audi - plans to reduce costs in its vw operations by seven billion euros .
the cost-savings plan , which aims to increase group net profit by four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.83 billion -rrb- by 2008 , would come partly from a two-billion-euro improvement in sales and distribution as well as a three-billion-euro cut in material costs . another one billion euros would come from a reduction in production costs , 500 million from lower overheads as well as another 500 million in warrant costs , it said . wolfgang bernhard , the head of the volkswagen division who has a reputation as a cost-cutting specialist , warned there were " no sacred cows " in his division , which groups the volkswagen , skoda , bentley and bugatti brand names . but he sought to downplay rumours the group planned massive job cuts and factory closures following a report in the financial times deutschland on monday that the company was preparing to shut a factory in brussels with 5,700 employees . opportunity for reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the departure of hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- was seen by some analysts as an opportunity for volkswagen to push through more draconian restructuring plans . they estimate the company needs to cut about 30,000 jobs .
but due to vw 's unique corporate governance policy which gives unions and workers ' representatives unusual amounts of power - even for labor-friendly germany - such cuts are very difficult to push through . " that 's a tragedy for vw , because it means they can not set objectives like the toyotas , like the bmws to have a strategy which optimizes stakeholder value , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , the director of the center of automotive research at the university of applied sciences gelsenkirchen . despite the plans to reduce costs , the group vowed to continue investing and unveiled an initiative to spend 2.5 billion euros per year to improve its core passenger car business in 2006-2008 . millions paid in india hartz is the latest vw executive to bear the brunt of the growing bribery scandal , whose first tremors of the scandal came last month when the former head of personnel at vw 's skoda unit , helmuth schuster , resigned amid allegations of bribery and fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday , a top minister in india 's southern state of andhra pradesh admitted to paying money to try secure a deal with the german auto giant but denied it was a bribe . " the money was paid to vasishta wahan which we were told is an indian arm of volkswagen , " state chief minister y.s. rajasekhara reddy told reporters in this southern indian city . reddy was reacting to charges that the state government had paid 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to vasishta wahan , a shadowy company , which shares the same initials as the automaker and projected itself as the indian arm of volkswagen . vasishta wahan = vw ? the government 's dealings with volkswagen have been under a cloud after schuster quit last month amid bribery allegations and claims in german press reports that he used dummy companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably in india and angola . # b # the andhra pradesh government claims schuster -lrb- photo -rrb- " pressured " them to pay five million euros to vasitha wahan , which he claimed was volkswagen 's indian arm .
the sum was to be paid as equity for a proposed volkswagen manufacturing plant to be set up in andhra pradesh 's major port city of visakhapatnam . " he sent us a letter asking for five million euros as nominal equity in the project to affirm our commitment to it , " reddy said . however , opposition parties in the state are demanding an explanation as to why the government released a tranche of two million euros merely on the advice of schuster without verifying the background of vasishta wahan . the german media has reported that the bribery scandal at volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of the factory in india . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw scandal puts pressure on works council the growing bribery scandal at volkswagen has led critics to challenge the system of co-determination in labor relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2005 germany on un diplomatic offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense diplomatic maneuvering at the un over the next week after rejection by the us of a draft resolution by germany and three other countries for permanent un security council seats , berlin and its allies are going on the offensive to drum up support for their plan . the four nations making up the so-called g-4 - germany , japan , brazil and india - will take their case to representatives of the 53 states of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- in the hopes of getting their support despite the fact that the united states and a number of countries have slammed their un reform model . the us , along with pakistan , algeria , argentina , canada and new zealand , said the g-4 text , which calls for expanding the 15-member security council to 25 , does not enjoy broad-based support .
the us urged the general assembly to vote against it . the g-4 plan would create six new permanent seats without veto power , including two from africa , and four non-permanent seats .
the group says this would make the body , created after world war ii , more representative of today 's geo-political situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council at un headquarters in new york at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the security council , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power . diplomats said in new york on wednesday that foreign ministers from g-4 counties hoped to meet with their counterparts from nigeria and ghana on sunday or monday .
" we are ready for consultations on the ministerial level , " one diplomat told reuters .
the g-4 argues that the africans would be the big winner by gaining two permanent council seats if the g-4 proposal was adopted . on sunday , g-4 representatives will meet with the president of the general assembly , jean ping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the diplomatic efforts bear no fruit , the four countries have another strategy ready .
they will call for a general vote on a draft resolution put forward by the au for council reform .
if the general assembly rejects the resolution , the g-4 will present its plan as a compromise option . au submits draft text the au formally submitted a draft resolution calling for six new permanent seats with veto power on the un security council , including two for africa , to the general assembly wednesday , african diplomats said .
but the draft was introduced on an individual basis by some african countries rather than on behalf of the entire african bloc , one diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier a negotiating team , mandated by the african union and led by nigerian foreign minister olu adeniji , told reporters that although africans would introduce their draft , they remained open to negotiations with other groups on rival proposals . " africa has a position which it wants to place on the record but the african union does not exclude negotiations with other groups , " said adeniji who came here to promote the african draft . the africans want a 26-member security council , with six new permanent seats with veto power , including two for africa , and five non-permanent seats , also including two for africa . third draft a so-called " united for consensus " group led by pakistan , argentina , canada , italy and mexico is circulating a third draft asking for 10 new non-permanent council members who would be elected for two years as is the case at present , but with the possibility of immediate re-election . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan . now or never german foreign minister joschka fischer hit back wednesday at us opposition to the g-4 proposal saying washington must decide now if it wants un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , shakes hands with israeli prime minister ariel sharon prior to their meeting at sharon 's jerusalem office on wednesday " i am very familiar with their arguments but ultimately it is a question of whether you want reform or not .
and delaying things will only lead to there being no reform , " fischer told reporters on a visit to jerusalem . fischer argued the g-4 resolution was the only proposal put forward that would bring all the underrepresented regions of the world to the table .
" only the g-4 proposal takes into account regional balance , which is an essential point , " he said , urging " calm " in the debate . but in berlin , the tone was more conciliatory .
government spokesman bela anda told a regular press briefing on wednesday that berlin remained hopeful that the g-4 resolution would be adopted . " germany remains convinced the g-4 model is fair and balanced , " government spokesperson anda told reporters .
" it 's no surprise that some nations are going to take such a strong stand , " he said when asked about washington 's position . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us rejects berlin 's un bid the united states has rejected a draft resolution by brazil , germany , india and japan seeking enlargement of the united nations security council .

the unesco world heritage committee meeting in durban , south africa , on wednesday asked the german government to submit a report on the cologne cathedral to address concerns over the recent construction of skycrapers .
" they were not satisfied that the germans had provided adequate guarantees that they would refrain from building skyscrapers , " said the official who attended the meeting but asked not to be named .
" germany will have to provide a report by the end of this year outlining its intentions for the surrounding of the site , " he told afp .
" based on that information , the committee will decide whether to delist the property altogether from the world heritage site . "
built over seven centuries until 1880 , the cologne cathedral was proclaimed a world heritage site in 1996 but last year the unesco committee put in on the list of endangered sites .
the world heritage list currently contains 788 sites - 611 of them manmade , 154 natural and 23 a combination of the two - spread across 134 countries . dw-world.de crunch time for cathedral 's heritage status the fate of cologne 's cathedral , a un-protected site since 1996 , will be decided this week .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .
any improvements will be seen as progress after such dismal report cards over the past few years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .
any improvements will be seen as progress after such dismal report cards over the past few years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

and in 1961 , the year the berlin wall was built , the north-south u9 subway line also began running through bahnhof zoo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bahnhof zoologischer garten in berlin , aufgenommen im juli 1946 .

it only reopened for both s-bahn and long-distance trains in 1955 . loss of stature although the station has bounced back from bombs and rehabilitated itself , partially , from its image as the center of berlin 's drug culture , it appears that it will finally fall victim to german reunification . when the wall fell , berlin 's center of gravity shifted back to where it originally was , to the neighborhood of mitte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed train in front of the reichstag zoo station began to lose some of its importance and with last week 's decision by german rail to strike the station from its list of stops for long-distance and high-speed trains , its fate appears to be sealed .
zoo station will return to its original role as one district station among others . but it 's not going down without a fight .
emotions have been running high since german rail announced its decision and monika thiemen , district mayor , is lobbying to maintain the station as a western hub . " we do not agree with this decision and want german rail to reconsider , " she said .
" it 's not right that the trains ca n't make just a four-minute stop that makes the lives of citizens here so much easier . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehrter bahnhof , berlin 's soon-to-be-complete central train station another resident , helga fischer , is starting a citizen 's initiative to save the station .
she ca n't understand german rail 's decision to have some trains simply bypass zoo station for berlin 's new central train station further east , lehrter bahnhof -lrb- photo -rrb- . " it 's simply idiotic to stop having long-distance trains there just before the soccer world cup next year , " she said .
" it 's going to affect local business , increase traffic on the streets , and it 's caused a great deal of outrage here . " indeed , the daily tagesspiegel , mostly read in the west , notes that it has received more letters protesting the changes to the station than it has for almost any other municipal issue that has surfaced in berlin .
on the contrary , readers of the berliner zeitung , a daily read primarily in the east , have hardly made a peep . perhaps the band u2 summed it up well , and presciently , in their song zoo station from the early 90s . time is a train makes the future the past leaves you standing in the station your face pressed up against the glass the train has left the station . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still derailed over train harmony the enlargement of the european union exposed many discrepencies between member states .

the four suspected suicide bombers , three of whom have been identified by newspapers , were also britons of pakistani origin .
uk security sources believe the mastermind was involved in previous terror operations and has links with followers of osama bin laden 's al qaeda extremist group in the united states .
he is thought to have visited the bombers in their home city of leeds , northern england , and identified targets on the london underground rail subway system where three of the four bombs exploded , the paper said .
it is thought that he was likely to have trained the recruits in how to trigger their rucksack-carried bombs , three of which went off almost simultaneously at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , at the peak of last thursday 's morning rush hour killing at least 52 people .
police have reportedly switched their investigation towards seeking the mastermind of the bombings since learning that the four bombers killed themselves in the attacks .
home secretary charles clarke said earlier wednesday that the aim was now " to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating " bombers . police are also seeking a possible fifth member of the bombers ' terror cell , who was also seen at luton station , north of london , from where the attackers traveled into the capital .

" we have to know what 's going on in every mosque , " bavaria 's interior minister , günter beckstein , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" we have to have an intelligence presence there where extremist ideas are being preached . " beckstein , who is tipped as a potential federal interior minister if the conservative opposition wins this fall 's possible early election , said greater efforts were needed to watch germany 's muslims amid the unsettling realization that the bombing attacks in london were the work of british citizens of pakistani origin . " accordingly we have increase surveillance of religious fanatics , " he said , calling on the german muslim community to increase their cooperation with the authorities .
" we need the help of tolerant muslims . " beckstein 's sentiment was echoed by other conservative politicians .
wolfgang bosbach , the christian democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for interior issues , said suicide attackers could not be scared off by heightened security , making it more important to recruit informants from the local muslim community for the intelligence services . uwe schünemann , the conservative interior minister of lower saxony , even called for increasing the frequency of random control checks at german mosques .
" we need this instrument and we must make greater use of it , " he said . schünemann also called for a special sitting of parliament during the summer recess to pass measure creating a proposed national terror suspect index .
" this has to be done quickly since we 'll need it before the world cup , " he told the paper . boosting video surveillance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein also said more closed-circuit cameras to help secure soccer 's largest sporting spectacle , which germany will host next summer .
officials in berlin have already decided to boost security on public transport in berlin and the surrounding state of brandenburg with the installation of more video surveillance . " following the attacks on the british capital , we do n't want to be accused of not doing everything we can , " the head of the company responsible for the public transport in berlin -lrb- bvg -rrb- , thomas necker , told the berliner zeitung .
the bvg will also keep all video footage recorded for three days instead of the current 24 hours . brandenburg 's interior minister , jörg schönbohm , has also outlined plans to install closed-circuit cameras in various public areas including train stations and airports .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .
any improvements will be seen as progress after such dismal report cards over the past few years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .
any improvements will be seen as progress after such dismal report cards over the past few years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

the four suspected suicide bombers , three of whom have been identified by newspapers , were also britons of pakistani origin .
uk security sources believe the mastermind was involved in previous terror operations and has links with followers of osama bin laden 's al qaeda extremist group in the united states .
he is thought to have visited the bombers in their home city of leeds , northern england , and identified targets on the london underground rail subway system where three of the four bombs exploded , the paper said .
it is thought that he was likely to have trained the recruits in how to trigger their rucksack-carried bombs , three of which went off almost simultaneously at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , at the peak of last thursday 's morning rush hour killing at least 52 people .
police have reportedly switched their investigation towards seeking the mastermind of the bombings since learning that the four bombers killed themselves in the attacks .
home secretary charles clarke said earlier wednesday that the aim was now " to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating " bombers . police are also seeking a possible fifth member of the bombers ' terror cell , who was also seen at luton station , north of london , from where the attackers traveled into the capital .
the man , also believed to be of pakistani origin , could still be at large in london , the times said .
egyptian sought police additionally want to interview an egyptian-born university lecturer who was teaching in leeds until a few weeks ago .
according to the sun newspaper , the man , who it named as 33-year-old magdi el-nashar , was studying for a biochemistry doctorate at leeds university and disappeared just before the attacks , it is thought to egypt .

" a detailed forensic examination is expected to be carried out and may take some time to complete , " a statement from london 's metropolitan police said , adding that there had been no arrests from the raids .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
britain was set to fall silent for two minutes on thursday to remember the victims of the london suicide bombings .
people have been asked to stop what they 're doing at midday -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- , and pay silent respect to the people who died last thursday .

the four suspected suicide bombers , three of whom have been identified by newspapers , were also britons of pakistani origin .
uk security sources believe the mastermind was involved in previous terror operations and has links with followers of osama bin laden 's al qaeda extremist group in the united states .
he is thought to have visited the bombers in their home city of leeds , northern england , and identified targets on the london underground rail subway system where three of the four bombs exploded , the paper said .
it is thought that he was likely to have trained the recruits in how to trigger their rucksack-carried bombs , three of which went off almost simultaneously at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , at the peak of last thursday 's morning rush hour killing at least 52 people .
police have reportedly switched their investigation towards seeking the mastermind of the bombings since learning that the four bombers killed themselves in the attacks .
home secretary charles clarke said earlier wednesday that the aim was now " to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating " bombers . police are also seeking a possible fifth member of the bombers ' terror cell , who was also seen at luton station , north of london , from where the attackers traveled into the capital .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .

it marks the end of an era for many berliners . it is not a large , nor particularly elegant place , nothing on the scale of new york 's grand central or paris ' gare du nord .
there are only four railway platforms , one sit-down restaurant that has seen better days , a few fast-food counters and shops , and a permanent presence of homeless people , beggars , and prostitutes mixed in with the travelers and tourists . despite its lack of glamour , zoo station -lrb- officially bahnhof zoologischer garten , or shorter , bahnhof zoo -rrb- has a treasured place in the hearts of many berliners and the decision to take away its status next year as a primary stop for long-distance trains arriving in the german capital has many mourning what they see as the final dénouement of a legend that played a central role in the divided city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the almost three decades that the berlin wall separated two different political philosophies , not to mention neighbors , zoo station was the western sector 's main train terminal , despite its small size .
it came to almost represent the small island of democracy and capitalism in the socialist east german sea . " the symbolic power of the station is very strong , " said manuela damianakis , a spokesperson for berlin 's planning office .
" it was one of the most important parts of the city , especially since it was the arrival point for visitors from the west . " with the berlin wall 's construction , berlin 's traditional center , the neighborhood of mitte , was cut off from the west .

the four suspected suicide bombers , three of whom have been identified by newspapers , were also britons of pakistani origin .
uk security sources believe the mastermind was involved in previous terror operations and has links with followers of osama bin laden 's al qaeda extremist group in the united states .
he is thought to have visited the bombers in their home city of leeds , northern england , and identified targets on the london underground rail subway system where three of the four bombs exploded , the paper said .
it is thought that he was likely to have trained the recruits in how to trigger their rucksack-carried bombs , three of which went off almost simultaneously at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , at the peak of last thursday 's morning rush hour killing at least 52 people .
police have reportedly switched their investigation towards seeking the mastermind of the bombings since learning that the four bombers killed themselves in the attacks .
home secretary charles clarke said earlier wednesday that the aim was now " to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating " bombers . police are also seeking a possible fifth member of the bombers ' terror cell , who was also seen at luton station , north of london , from where the attackers traveled into the capital .
the man , also believed to be of pakistani origin , could still be at large in london , the times said .
egyptian sought police additionally want to interview an egyptian-born university lecturer who was teaching in leeds until a few weeks ago .
according to the sun newspaper , the man , who it named as 33-year-old magdi el-nashar , was studying for a biochemistry doctorate at leeds university and disappeared just before the attacks , it is thought to egypt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds , england on tuesday after officers raided residential premises in west yorkshire in connection with last week 's london bombings .
at least two of the bombers had links to his rented flat , which is one of six addresses in and around leeds raided by police on tuesday morning .
" a detailed forensic examination is expected to be carried out and may take some time to complete , " a statement from london 's metropolitan police said , adding that there had been no arrests from the raids .

the four suspected suicide bombers , three of whom have been identified by newspapers , were also britons of pakistani origin .
uk security sources believe the mastermind was involved in previous terror operations and has links with followers of osama bin laden 's al qaeda extremist group in the united states .
he is thought to have visited the bombers in their home city of leeds , northern england , and identified targets on the london underground rail subway system where three of the four bombs exploded , the paper said .
it is thought that he was likely to have trained the recruits in how to trigger their rucksack-carried bombs , three of which went off almost simultaneously at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , at the peak of last thursday 's morning rush hour killing at least 52 people .
police have reportedly switched their investigation towards seeking the mastermind of the bombings since learning that the four bombers killed themselves in the attacks .
home secretary charles clarke said earlier wednesday that the aim was now " to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating " bombers . police are also seeking a possible fifth member of the bombers ' terror cell , who was also seen at luton station , north of london , from where the attackers traveled into the capital .
the man , also believed to be of pakistani origin , could still be at large in london , the times said .
egyptian sought police additionally want to interview an egyptian-born university lecturer who was teaching in leeds until a few weeks ago .
according to the sun newspaper , the man , who it named as 33-year-old magdi el-nashar , was studying for a biochemistry doctorate at leeds university and disappeared just before the attacks , it is thought to egypt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds , england on tuesday after officers raided residential premises in west yorkshire in connection with last week 's london bombings .
at least two of the bombers had links to his rented flat , which is one of six addresses in and around leeds raided by police on tuesday morning .
" a detailed forensic examination is expected to be carried out and may take some time to complete , " a statement from london 's metropolitan police said , adding that there had been no arrests from the raids .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
britain was set to fall silent for two minutes on thursday to remember the victims of the london suicide bombings .
people have been asked to stop what they 're doing at midday -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- , and pay silent respect to the people who died last thursday .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .

the four suspected suicide bombers , three of whom have been identified by newspapers , were also britons of pakistani origin .
uk security sources believe the mastermind was involved in previous terror operations and has links with followers of osama bin laden 's al qaeda extremist group in the united states .
he is thought to have visited the bombers in their home city of leeds , northern england , and identified targets on the london underground rail subway system where three of the four bombs exploded , the paper said .
it is thought that he was likely to have trained the recruits in how to trigger their rucksack-carried bombs , three of which went off almost simultaneously at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , at the peak of last thursday 's morning rush hour killing at least 52 people .
police have reportedly switched their investigation towards seeking the mastermind of the bombings since learning that the four bombers killed themselves in the attacks .
home secretary charles clarke said earlier wednesday that the aim was now " to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating " bombers . police are also seeking a possible fifth member of the bombers ' terror cell , who was also seen at luton station , north of london , from where the attackers traveled into the capital .
the man , also believed to be of pakistani origin , could still be at large in london , the times said .
egyptian sought police additionally want to interview an egyptian-born university lecturer who was teaching in leeds until a few weeks ago .
according to the sun newspaper , the man , who it named as 33-year-old magdi el-nashar , was studying for a biochemistry doctorate at leeds university and disappeared just before the attacks , it is thought to egypt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds , england on tuesday after officers raided residential premises in west yorkshire in connection with last week 's london bombings .
at least two of the bombers had links to his rented flat , which is one of six addresses in and around leeds raided by police on tuesday morning .
" a detailed forensic examination is expected to be carried out and may take some time to complete , " a statement from london 's metropolitan police said , adding that there had been no arrests from the raids .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
britain was set to fall silent for two minutes on thursday to remember the victims of the london suicide bombings .
people have been asked to stop what they 're doing at midday -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- , and pay silent respect to the people who died last thursday .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .

meanwhile , bribery allegations surface in india involving a former vw exec and a shadowy company . members of the company 's inner council , a four-member supervisory board , said they had accepted the resignation of peter hartz , tendered last friday , and that company chief executive bernd pischetsrieder would take over his responsibilities on a temporary basis . head of the ig metall trade union jürgen peters said they hoped " to reach an agreement peacefully , but quickly " on hartz 's permanent replacement . separately , management announced it would continue with an ambitious cost-cutting program aimed at improving the operating efficiency of the group , europe 's biggest car maker . last year , volkswagen 's net profits fell 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the group , which is split into two car divisions - volkswagen and audi - plans to reduce costs in its vw operations by seven billion euros .
the cost-savings plan , which aims to increase group net profit by four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.83 billion -rrb- by 2008 , would come partly from a two-billion-euro improvement in sales and distribution as well as a three-billion-euro cut in material costs . another one billion euros would come from a reduction in production costs , 500 million from lower overheads as well as another 500 million in warrant costs , it said . wolfgang bernhard , the head of the volkswagen division who has a reputation as a cost-cutting specialist , warned there were " no sacred cows " in his division , which groups the volkswagen , skoda , bentley and bugatti brand names . but he sought to downplay rumours the group planned massive job cuts and factory closures following a report in the financial times deutschland on monday that the company was preparing to shut a factory in brussels with 5,700 employees . opportunity for reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the departure of hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- was seen by some analysts as an opportunity for volkswagen to push through more draconian restructuring plans . they estimate the company needs to cut about 30,000 jobs .
but due to vw 's unique corporate governance policy which gives unions and workers ' representatives unusual amounts of power - even for labor-friendly germany - such cuts are very difficult to push through . " that 's a tragedy for vw , because it means they can not set objectives like the toyotas , like the bmws to have a strategy which optimizes stakeholder value , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , the director of the center of automotive research at the university of applied sciences gelsenkirchen . despite the plans to reduce costs , the group vowed to continue investing and unveiled an initiative to spend 2.5 billion euros per year to improve its core passenger car business in 2006-2008 . millions paid in india hartz is the latest vw executive to bear the brunt of the growing bribery scandal , whose first tremors of the scandal came last month when the former head of personnel at vw 's skoda unit , helmuth schuster , resigned amid allegations of bribery and fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday , a top minister in india 's southern state of andhra pradesh admitted to paying money to try secure a deal with the german auto giant but denied it was a bribe . " the money was paid to vasishta wahan which we were told is an indian arm of volkswagen , " state chief minister y.s. rajasekhara reddy told reporters in this southern indian city . reddy was reacting to charges that the state government had paid 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to vasishta wahan , a shadowy company , which shares the same initials as the automaker and projected itself as the indian arm of volkswagen . vasishta wahan = vw ? the government 's dealings with volkswagen have been under a cloud after schuster quit last month amid bribery allegations and claims in german press reports that he used dummy companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably in india and angola . # b # the andhra pradesh government claims schuster -lrb- photo -rrb- " pressured " them to pay five million euros to vasitha wahan , which he claimed was volkswagen 's indian arm .
the sum was to be paid as equity for a proposed volkswagen manufacturing plant to be set up in andhra pradesh 's major port city of visakhapatnam . " he sent us a letter asking for five million euros as nominal equity in the project to affirm our commitment to it , " reddy said . however , opposition parties in the state are demanding an explanation as to why the government released a tranche of two million euros merely on the advice of schuster without verifying the background of vasishta wahan . the german media has reported that the bribery scandal at volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of the factory in india . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw scandal puts pressure on works council the growing bribery scandal at volkswagen has led critics to challenge the system of co-determination in labor relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2005 vw to cut costs as hartz departs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly blue skies for vw these days vw has accepted the resignation of its personnel head in a corruption scandal and vowed to press on with cost cutting .
meanwhile , bribery allegations surface in india involving a former vw exec and a shadowy company . members of the company 's inner council , a four-member supervisory board , said they had accepted the resignation of peter hartz , tendered last friday , and that company chief executive bernd pischetsrieder would take over his responsibilities on a temporary basis . head of the ig metall trade union jürgen peters said they hoped " to reach an agreement peacefully , but quickly " on hartz 's permanent replacement . separately , management announced it would continue with an ambitious cost-cutting program aimed at improving the operating efficiency of the group , europe 's biggest car maker . last year , volkswagen 's net profits fell 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the group , which is split into two car divisions - volkswagen and audi - plans to reduce costs in its vw operations by seven billion euros .
the cost-savings plan , which aims to increase group net profit by four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.83 billion -rrb- by 2008 , would come partly from a two-billion-euro improvement in sales and distribution as well as a three-billion-euro cut in material costs . another one billion euros would come from a reduction in production costs , 500 million from lower overheads as well as another 500 million in warrant costs , it said . wolfgang bernhard , the head of the volkswagen division who has a reputation as a cost-cutting specialist , warned there were " no sacred cows " in his division , which groups the volkswagen , skoda , bentley and bugatti brand names . but he sought to downplay rumours the group planned massive job cuts and factory closures following a report in the financial times deutschland on monday that the company was preparing to shut a factory in brussels with 5,700 employees . opportunity for reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the departure of hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- was seen by some analysts as an opportunity for volkswagen to push through more draconian restructuring plans . they estimate the company needs to cut about 30,000 jobs .
but due to vw 's unique corporate governance policy which gives unions and workers ' representatives unusual amounts of power - even for labor-friendly germany - such cuts are very difficult to push through . " that 's a tragedy for vw , because it means they can not set objectives like the toyotas , like the bmws to have a strategy which optimizes stakeholder value , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , the director of the center of automotive research at the university of applied sciences gelsenkirchen . despite the plans to reduce costs , the group vowed to continue investing and unveiled an initiative to spend 2.5 billion euros per year to improve its core passenger car business in 2006-2008 . millions paid in india hartz is the latest vw executive to bear the brunt of the growing bribery scandal , whose first tremors of the scandal came last month when the former head of personnel at vw 's skoda unit , helmuth schuster , resigned amid allegations of bribery and fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday , a top minister in india 's southern state of andhra pradesh admitted to paying money to try secure a deal with the german auto giant but denied it was a bribe . " the money was paid to vasishta wahan which we were told is an indian arm of volkswagen , " state chief minister y.s. rajasekhara reddy told reporters in this southern indian city . reddy was reacting to charges that the state government had paid 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to vasishta wahan , a shadowy company , which shares the same initials as the automaker and projected itself as the indian arm of volkswagen . vasishta wahan = vw ? the government 's dealings with volkswagen have been under a cloud after schuster quit last month amid bribery allegations and claims in german press reports that he used dummy companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably in india and angola . # b # the andhra pradesh government claims schuster -lrb- photo -rrb- " pressured " them to pay five million euros to vasitha wahan , which he claimed was volkswagen 's indian arm .
the sum was to be paid as equity for a proposed volkswagen manufacturing plant to be set up in andhra pradesh 's major port city of visakhapatnam . " he sent us a letter asking for five million euros as nominal equity in the project to affirm our commitment to it , " reddy said . however , opposition parties in the state are demanding an explanation as to why the government released a tranche of two million euros merely on the advice of schuster without verifying the background of vasishta wahan . the german media has reported that the bribery scandal at volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of the factory in india . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw scandal puts pressure on works council the growing bribery scandal at volkswagen has led critics to challenge the system of co-determination in labor relations .
it was long considered the springboard for west germany 's postwar economic miracle .

" we have to know what 's going on in every mosque , " bavaria 's interior minister , günter beckstein , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" we have to have an intelligence presence there where extremist ideas are being preached . " beckstein , who is tipped as a potential federal interior minister if the conservative opposition wins this fall 's possible early election , said greater efforts were needed to watch germany 's muslims amid the unsettling realization that the bombing attacks in london were the work of british citizens of pakistani origin . " accordingly we have increase surveillance of religious fanatics , " he said , calling on the german muslim community to increase their cooperation with the authorities .
" we need the help of tolerant muslims . " beckstein 's sentiment was echoed by other conservative politicians .
wolfgang bosbach , the christian democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for interior issues , said suicide attackers could not be scared off by heightened security , making it more important to recruit informants from the local muslim community for the intelligence services . uwe schünemann , the conservative interior minister of lower saxony , even called for increasing the frequency of random control checks at german mosques .
" we need this instrument and we must make greater use of it , " he said . schünemann also called for a special sitting of parliament during the summer recess to pass measure creating a proposed national terror suspect index .
" this has to be done quickly since we 'll need it before the world cup , " he told the paper . boosting video surveillance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein also said more closed-circuit cameras to help secure soccer 's largest sporting spectacle , which germany will host next summer .

" following the attacks on the british capital , we do n't want to be accused of not doing everything we can , " the head of the company responsible for the public transport in berlin -lrb- bvg -rrb- , thomas necker , told the berliner zeitung .
the bvg will also keep all video footage recorded for three days instead of the current 24 hours . brandenburg 's interior minister , jörg schönbohm , has also outlined plans to install closed-circuit cameras in various public areas including train stations and airports .
" the swift success of britain 's police investigations just goes to show how important closed-circuit cameras are , " schönbohm told the tabloid bild . in london , video footage of the four suspected bombers was able to be retrieved just five days after the attacks took place . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk police hunt bombing mastermind as europe on thursday prepared to observe a moment of silence for the victims of last week 's london bombings , british police have reportedly identified the man thought to be the mastermind behind the deadly attacks .
-lrb- july 14 , 2005 -rrb- eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .
-lrb- july 14 , 2005 -rrb- german media under fire from muslims the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.07.2005 uk police hunt bombing mastermind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigation has shifted to the northern english city of leeds as europe on thursday prepared to observe a moment of silence for the victims of last week 's london bombings , british police have reportedly identified the man thought to be the mastermind behind the deadly attacks . the british-born man in his 30s , of pakistani origin , arrived at a british port last month and left the country again the day before thursday 's attacks , the times newspaper reported .
the four suspected suicide bombers , three of whom have been identified by newspapers , were also britons of pakistani origin .
uk security sources believe the mastermind was involved in previous terror operations and has links with followers of osama bin laden 's al qaeda extremist group in the united states .
he is thought to have visited the bombers in their home city of leeds , northern england , and identified targets on the london underground rail subway system where three of the four bombs exploded , the paper said .
it is thought that he was likely to have trained the recruits in how to trigger their rucksack-carried bombs , three of which went off almost simultaneously at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , at the peak of last thursday 's morning rush hour killing at least 52 people .
police have reportedly switched their investigation towards seeking the mastermind of the bombings since learning that the four bombers killed themselves in the attacks .
home secretary charles clarke said earlier wednesday that the aim was now " to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating " bombers . police are also seeking a possible fifth member of the bombers ' terror cell , who was also seen at luton station , north of london , from where the attackers traveled into the capital .
the man , also believed to be of pakistani origin , could still be at large in london , the times said .
egyptian sought police additionally want to interview an egyptian-born university lecturer who was teaching in leeds until a few weeks ago .
according to the sun newspaper , the man , who it named as 33-year-old magdi el-nashar , was studying for a biochemistry doctorate at leeds university and disappeared just before the attacks , it is thought to egypt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds , england on tuesday after officers raided residential premises in west yorkshire in connection with last week 's london bombings .
at least two of the bombers had links to his rented flat , which is one of six addresses in and around leeds raided by police on tuesday morning .
" a detailed forensic examination is expected to be carried out and may take some time to complete , " a statement from london 's metropolitan police said , adding that there had been no arrests from the raids .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .

berliners can dust off their dancing shoes - it 's really happening .
after much speculation , the family of exonerated pop star michael jackson will hold a reunion in the german capital .
and they 've got lots to celebrate . not long after being acquitted of child sex abuse charges , michael jackson flew to bahrain to relax .
now , though , it 's time to party .
and for that , the king of pop looks set to join the rest of his family in berlin , where a party is being planned on july 22 to thank european fans who stood by the singer during his trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joe jackson the family has an additional reason to celebrate , as patriarch joe jackson marks his 76th birthday that same weekend .

" one ca n't know that for sure , " said a spokesperson from the ricercar agency , which is helping to organize the fete . the invitation list also appears to be open , as between 1,000 and 2,000 guests are expected , among them the jackson siblings la toya , jermaine and janet . blame it on berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael jackson dangles his baby son , prince michael ii , over the balcony of his room at berlin 's adlon hotel .

it 's a moment few of the onlookers below are likely to have forgotten , either . there 's no telling what exciting moments jackson 's upcoming visit might bring - no details about the weekend 's program have been released so far . but according to reports in the berliner zeitung daily , the family might enjoy a blast from the past as they revisit their disco roots .

" we have to know what 's going on in every mosque , " bavaria 's interior minister , günter beckstein , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" we have to have an intelligence presence there where extremist ideas are being preached . " beckstein , who is tipped as a potential federal interior minister if the conservative opposition wins this fall 's possible early election , said greater efforts were needed to watch germany 's muslims amid the unsettling realization that the bombing attacks in london were the work of british citizens of pakistani origin . " accordingly we have increase surveillance of religious fanatics , " he said , calling on the german muslim community to increase their cooperation with the authorities .
" we need the help of tolerant muslims . " beckstein 's sentiment was echoed by other conservative politicians .

" following the attacks on the british capital , we do n't want to be accused of not doing everything we can , " the head of the company responsible for the public transport in berlin -lrb- bvg -rrb- , thomas necker , told the berliner zeitung .
the bvg will also keep all video footage recorded for three days instead of the current 24 hours . brandenburg 's interior minister , jörg schönbohm , has also outlined plans to install closed-circuit cameras in various public areas including train stations and airports .
" the swift success of britain 's police investigations just goes to show how important closed-circuit cameras are , " schönbohm told the tabloid bild . in london , video footage of the four suspected bombers was able to be retrieved just five days after the attacks took place . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk police hunt bombing mastermind as europe on thursday prepared to observe a moment of silence for the victims of last week 's london bombings , british police have reportedly identified the man thought to be the mastermind behind the deadly attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.07.2005 derailing an icon of west berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoo station is soon to lose some of its slightly gritty shine german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .
it marks the end of an era for many berliners . it is not a large , nor particularly elegant place , nothing on the scale of new york 's grand central or paris ' gare du nord .
there are only four railway platforms , one sit-down restaurant that has seen better days , a few fast-food counters and shops , and a permanent presence of homeless people , beggars , and prostitutes mixed in with the travelers and tourists . despite its lack of glamour , zoo station -lrb- officially bahnhof zoologischer garten , or shorter , bahnhof zoo -rrb- has a treasured place in the hearts of many berliners and the decision to take away its status next year as a primary stop for long-distance trains arriving in the german capital has many mourning what they see as the final dénouement of a legend that played a central role in the divided city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the almost three decades that the berlin wall separated two different political philosophies , not to mention neighbors , zoo station was the western sector 's main train terminal , despite its small size .
it came to almost represent the small island of democracy and capitalism in the socialist east german sea . " the symbolic power of the station is very strong , " said manuela damianakis , a spokesperson for berlin 's planning office .
" it was one of the most important parts of the city , especially since it was the arrival point for visitors from the west . " with the berlin wall 's construction , berlin 's traditional center , the neighborhood of mitte , was cut off from the west .
a new center developed , with its focus around zoo station and the kaiser wilhelm memorial church .
it served as a capitalist counterpoint to the socialist city center at alexanderplatz in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoping time - the kurfuerstendamm boulevard in western berlin just a block away from the station begins the elegant kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the europa center shopping mall is a stone 's throw away as is the huge kadewe department store .
movie theaters and popular discos are also nearby . " there is something mythic about the station , because it was at the very heart of west berlin life for so many years , " said damianakis . disaffected youth but zoo station did not just represent the glitzy side of life in the fishbowl that was on the front lines of the cold war .
the station was also a magnet for the disaffected youth who hinted at a darker side of postwar west germany 's economic prosperity . berlin was often a destination for young people who wanted to escape the constraints of west german middle-class smugness .
zoo station , in turn , often caught those who fell victim to some of the excesses of these alternative lifestyles .
in the 1970s and 80s , it became known as a gathering place for drop-outs and punks .
the street running along the back of the station , jebensstrasse , became notorious for its prostitution and drug scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that world was documented in a biographical film called " we children from bahnhof zoo . "
based on a biography by christiane felscherinow , it recounts the descent of a teenage young girl into a vortex of drugs and sex for hire , all from the perspective of her and her friends .
the film used the station and its environs as a gritty , hopeless backdrop . in the 1990s , the city stepped in to try and rid the station of its more undesirable elements and improve the atmosphere for the many tourists and commuters who pass through every day .
police patrols were stepped up and in the mid-90s , much of the station was renovated . however , it still serves as a gathering place for the homeless , and teenage prostitutes still ply their trade behind the station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hagen the station has been the topic of books , songs by artists like u2 and nina hagen -lrb- photo -rrb- and a popular musical , called " line 1 , " which tells the story of a west german girl arriving at zoo station to experience life and love in the big city . history zoo station was originally opened in 1882 , but was not a railway station , rather handled traffic for the city 's stadtbahn , or municipal light-rail system .
two years later , long-distance trains began running through the station . in 1902 , the first subway line in berlin , the east-west u2 line , began operation at zoo station .
in the 1930s , a new commuter train , or s-bahn , hall was constructed and the railway hall was expanded .
and in 1961 , the year the berlin wall was built , the north-south u9 subway line also began running through bahnhof zoo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bahnhof zoologischer garten in berlin , aufgenommen im juli 1946 .
foto : landesbildstelle berlin the station had been damaged in the bombing of berlin during wwii and during the final battle for the german capital .
it only reopened for both s-bahn and long-distance trains in 1955 . loss of stature although the station has bounced back from bombs and rehabilitated itself , partially , from its image as the center of berlin 's drug culture , it appears that it will finally fall victim to german reunification . when the wall fell , berlin 's center of gravity shifted back to where it originally was , to the neighborhood of mitte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed train in front of the reichstag zoo station began to lose some of its importance and with last week 's decision by german rail to strike the station from its list of stops for long-distance and high-speed trains , its fate appears to be sealed .
zoo station will return to its original role as one district station among others . but it 's not going down without a fight .
emotions have been running high since german rail announced its decision and monika thiemen , district mayor , is lobbying to maintain the station as a western hub . " we do not agree with this decision and want german rail to reconsider , " she said .
" it 's not right that the trains ca n't make just a four-minute stop that makes the lives of citizens here so much easier .

the four suspected suicide bombers , three of whom have been identified by newspapers , were also britons of pakistani origin .
uk security sources believe the mastermind was involved in previous terror operations and has links with followers of osama bin laden 's al qaeda extremist group in the united states .
he is thought to have visited the bombers in their home city of leeds , northern england , and identified targets on the london underground rail subway system where three of the four bombs exploded , the paper said .
it is thought that he was likely to have trained the recruits in how to trigger their rucksack-carried bombs , three of which went off almost simultaneously at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , at the peak of last thursday 's morning rush hour killing at least 52 people .
police have reportedly switched their investigation towards seeking the mastermind of the bombings since learning that the four bombers killed themselves in the attacks .
home secretary charles clarke said earlier wednesday that the aim was now " to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating " bombers . police are also seeking a possible fifth member of the bombers ' terror cell , who was also seen at luton station , north of london , from where the attackers traveled into the capital .
the man , also believed to be of pakistani origin , could still be at large in london , the times said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2005 vw to cut costs as hartz departs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly blue skies for vw these days vw has accepted the resignation of its personnel head in a corruption scandal and vowed to press on with cost cutting .
meanwhile , bribery allegations surface in india involving a former vw exec and a shadowy company . members of the company 's inner council , a four-member supervisory board , said they had accepted the resignation of peter hartz , tendered last friday , and that company chief executive bernd pischetsrieder would take over his responsibilities on a temporary basis . head of the ig metall trade union jürgen peters said they hoped " to reach an agreement peacefully , but quickly " on hartz 's permanent replacement . separately , management announced it would continue with an ambitious cost-cutting program aimed at improving the operating efficiency of the group , europe 's biggest car maker . last year , volkswagen 's net profits fell 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the group , which is split into two car divisions - volkswagen and audi - plans to reduce costs in its vw operations by seven billion euros .
the cost-savings plan , which aims to increase group net profit by four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.83 billion -rrb- by 2008 , would come partly from a two-billion-euro improvement in sales and distribution as well as a three-billion-euro cut in material costs . another one billion euros would come from a reduction in production costs , 500 million from lower overheads as well as another 500 million in warrant costs , it said . wolfgang bernhard , the head of the volkswagen division who has a reputation as a cost-cutting specialist , warned there were " no sacred cows " in his division , which groups the volkswagen , skoda , bentley and bugatti brand names . but he sought to downplay rumours the group planned massive job cuts and factory closures following a report in the financial times deutschland on monday that the company was preparing to shut a factory in brussels with 5,700 employees . opportunity for reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the departure of hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- was seen by some analysts as an opportunity for volkswagen to push through more draconian restructuring plans . they estimate the company needs to cut about 30,000 jobs .
but due to vw 's unique corporate governance policy which gives unions and workers ' representatives unusual amounts of power - even for labor-friendly germany - such cuts are very difficult to push through . " that 's a tragedy for vw , because it means they can not set objectives like the toyotas , like the bmws to have a strategy which optimizes stakeholder value , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , the director of the center of automotive research at the university of applied sciences gelsenkirchen . despite the plans to reduce costs , the group vowed to continue investing and unveiled an initiative to spend 2.5 billion euros per year to improve its core passenger car business in 2006-2008 . millions paid in india hartz is the latest vw executive to bear the brunt of the growing bribery scandal , whose first tremors of the scandal came last month when the former head of personnel at vw 's skoda unit , helmuth schuster , resigned amid allegations of bribery and fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday , a top minister in india 's southern state of andhra pradesh admitted to paying money to try secure a deal with the german auto giant but denied it was a bribe . " the money was paid to vasishta wahan which we were told is an indian arm of volkswagen , " state chief minister y.s. rajasekhara reddy told reporters in this southern indian city . reddy was reacting to charges that the state government had paid 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to vasishta wahan , a shadowy company , which shares the same initials as the automaker and projected itself as the indian arm of volkswagen . vasishta wahan = vw ? the government 's dealings with volkswagen have been under a cloud after schuster quit last month amid bribery allegations and claims in german press reports that he used dummy companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably in india and angola . # b # the andhra pradesh government claims schuster -lrb- photo -rrb- " pressured " them to pay five million euros to vasitha wahan , which he claimed was volkswagen 's indian arm .
the sum was to be paid as equity for a proposed volkswagen manufacturing plant to be set up in andhra pradesh 's major port city of visakhapatnam . " he sent us a letter asking for five million euros as nominal equity in the project to affirm our commitment to it , " reddy said . however , opposition parties in the state are demanding an explanation as to why the government released a tranche of two million euros merely on the advice of schuster without verifying the background of vasishta wahan . the german media has reported that the bribery scandal at volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of the factory in india . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw scandal puts pressure on works council the growing bribery scandal at volkswagen has led critics to challenge the system of co-determination in labor relations .

meanwhile , bribery allegations surface in india involving a former vw exec and a shadowy company . members of the company 's inner council , a four-member supervisory board , said they had accepted the resignation of peter hartz , tendered last friday , and that company chief executive bernd pischetsrieder would take over his responsibilities on a temporary basis . head of the ig metall trade union jürgen peters said they hoped " to reach an agreement peacefully , but quickly " on hartz 's permanent replacement . separately , management announced it would continue with an ambitious cost-cutting program aimed at improving the operating efficiency of the group , europe 's biggest car maker . last year , volkswagen 's net profits fell 30 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the group , which is split into two car divisions - volkswagen and audi - plans to reduce costs in its vw operations by seven billion euros .
the cost-savings plan , which aims to increase group net profit by four billion euros -lrb- $ 4.83 billion -rrb- by 2008 , would come partly from a two-billion-euro improvement in sales and distribution as well as a three-billion-euro cut in material costs . another one billion euros would come from a reduction in production costs , 500 million from lower overheads as well as another 500 million in warrant costs , it said . wolfgang bernhard , the head of the volkswagen division who has a reputation as a cost-cutting specialist , warned there were " no sacred cows " in his division , which groups the volkswagen , skoda , bentley and bugatti brand names . but he sought to downplay rumours the group planned massive job cuts and factory closures following a report in the financial times deutschland on monday that the company was preparing to shut a factory in brussels with 5,700 employees . opportunity for reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the departure of hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- was seen by some analysts as an opportunity for volkswagen to push through more draconian restructuring plans . they estimate the company needs to cut about 30,000 jobs .
but due to vw 's unique corporate governance policy which gives unions and workers ' representatives unusual amounts of power - even for labor-friendly germany - such cuts are very difficult to push through . " that 's a tragedy for vw , because it means they can not set objectives like the toyotas , like the bmws to have a strategy which optimizes stakeholder value , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , the director of the center of automotive research at the university of applied sciences gelsenkirchen . despite the plans to reduce costs , the group vowed to continue investing and unveiled an initiative to spend 2.5 billion euros per year to improve its core passenger car business in 2006-2008 . millions paid in india hartz is the latest vw executive to bear the brunt of the growing bribery scandal , whose first tremors of the scandal came last month when the former head of personnel at vw 's skoda unit , helmuth schuster , resigned amid allegations of bribery and fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday , a top minister in india 's southern state of andhra pradesh admitted to paying money to try secure a deal with the german auto giant but denied it was a bribe . " the money was paid to vasishta wahan which we were told is an indian arm of volkswagen , " state chief minister y.s. rajasekhara reddy told reporters in this southern indian city . reddy was reacting to charges that the state government had paid 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to vasishta wahan , a shadowy company , which shares the same initials as the automaker and projected itself as the indian arm of volkswagen . vasishta wahan = vw ? the government 's dealings with volkswagen have been under a cloud after schuster quit last month amid bribery allegations and claims in german press reports that he used dummy companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably in india and angola . # b # the andhra pradesh government claims schuster -lrb- photo -rrb- " pressured " them to pay five million euros to vasitha wahan , which he claimed was volkswagen 's indian arm .
the sum was to be paid as equity for a proposed volkswagen manufacturing plant to be set up in andhra pradesh 's major port city of visakhapatnam . " he sent us a letter asking for five million euros as nominal equity in the project to affirm our commitment to it , " reddy said . however , opposition parties in the state are demanding an explanation as to why the government released a tranche of two million euros merely on the advice of schuster without verifying the background of vasishta wahan . the german media has reported that the bribery scandal at volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of the factory in india . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw scandal puts pressure on works council the growing bribery scandal at volkswagen has led critics to challenge the system of co-determination in labor relations .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.07.2005 derailing an icon of west berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoo station is soon to lose some of its slightly gritty shine german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .
it marks the end of an era for many berliners . it is not a large , nor particularly elegant place , nothing on the scale of new york 's grand central or paris ' gare du nord .
there are only four railway platforms , one sit-down restaurant that has seen better days , a few fast-food counters and shops , and a permanent presence of homeless people , beggars , and prostitutes mixed in with the travelers and tourists . despite its lack of glamour , zoo station -lrb- officially bahnhof zoologischer garten , or shorter , bahnhof zoo -rrb- has a treasured place in the hearts of many berliners and the decision to take away its status next year as a primary stop for long-distance trains arriving in the german capital has many mourning what they see as the final dénouement of a legend that played a central role in the divided city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the almost three decades that the berlin wall separated two different political philosophies , not to mention neighbors , zoo station was the western sector 's main train terminal , despite its small size .
it came to almost represent the small island of democracy and capitalism in the socialist east german sea . " the symbolic power of the station is very strong , " said manuela damianakis , a spokesperson for berlin 's planning office .
" it was one of the most important parts of the city , especially since it was the arrival point for visitors from the west . " with the berlin wall 's construction , berlin 's traditional center , the neighborhood of mitte , was cut off from the west .
a new center developed , with its focus around zoo station and the kaiser wilhelm memorial church .
it served as a capitalist counterpoint to the socialist city center at alexanderplatz in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoping time - the kurfuerstendamm boulevard in western berlin just a block away from the station begins the elegant kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the europa center shopping mall is a stone 's throw away as is the huge kadewe department store .
movie theaters and popular discos are also nearby . " there is something mythic about the station , because it was at the very heart of west berlin life for so many years , " said damianakis . disaffected youth but zoo station did not just represent the glitzy side of life in the fishbowl that was on the front lines of the cold war .
the station was also a magnet for the disaffected youth who hinted at a darker side of postwar west germany 's economic prosperity . berlin was often a destination for young people who wanted to escape the constraints of west german middle-class smugness .
zoo station , in turn , often caught those who fell victim to some of the excesses of these alternative lifestyles .
in the 1970s and 80s , it became known as a gathering place for drop-outs and punks .
the street running along the back of the station , jebensstrasse , became notorious for its prostitution and drug scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that world was documented in a biographical film called " we children from bahnhof zoo . "
based on a biography by christiane felscherinow , it recounts the descent of a teenage young girl into a vortex of drugs and sex for hire , all from the perspective of her and her friends .
the film used the station and its environs as a gritty , hopeless backdrop . in the 1990s , the city stepped in to try and rid the station of its more undesirable elements and improve the atmosphere for the many tourists and commuters who pass through every day .
police patrols were stepped up and in the mid-90s , much of the station was renovated . however , it still serves as a gathering place for the homeless , and teenage prostitutes still ply their trade behind the station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hagen the station has been the topic of books , songs by artists like u2 and nina hagen -lrb- photo -rrb- and a popular musical , called " line 1 , " which tells the story of a west german girl arriving at zoo station to experience life and love in the big city . history zoo station was originally opened in 1882 , but was not a railway station , rather handled traffic for the city 's stadtbahn , or municipal light-rail system .
two years later , long-distance trains began running through the station . in 1902 , the first subway line in berlin , the east-west u2 line , began operation at zoo station .
in the 1930s , a new commuter train , or s-bahn , hall was constructed and the railway hall was expanded .
and in 1961 , the year the berlin wall was built , the north-south u9 subway line also began running through bahnhof zoo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bahnhof zoologischer garten in berlin , aufgenommen im juli 1946 .

it marks the end of an era for many berliners . it is not a large , nor particularly elegant place , nothing on the scale of new york 's grand central or paris ' gare du nord .
there are only four railway platforms , one sit-down restaurant that has seen better days , a few fast-food counters and shops , and a permanent presence of homeless people , beggars , and prostitutes mixed in with the travelers and tourists . despite its lack of glamour , zoo station -lrb- officially bahnhof zoologischer garten , or shorter , bahnhof zoo -rrb- has a treasured place in the hearts of many berliners and the decision to take away its status next year as a primary stop for long-distance trains arriving in the german capital has many mourning what they see as the final dénouement of a legend that played a central role in the divided city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the almost three decades that the berlin wall separated two different political philosophies , not to mention neighbors , zoo station was the western sector 's main train terminal , despite its small size .
it came to almost represent the small island of democracy and capitalism in the socialist east german sea . " the symbolic power of the station is very strong , " said manuela damianakis , a spokesperson for berlin 's planning office .
" it was one of the most important parts of the city , especially since it was the arrival point for visitors from the west . " with the berlin wall 's construction , berlin 's traditional center , the neighborhood of mitte , was cut off from the west .
a new center developed , with its focus around zoo station and the kaiser wilhelm memorial church .
it served as a capitalist counterpoint to the socialist city center at alexanderplatz in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoping time - the kurfuerstendamm boulevard in western berlin just a block away from the station begins the elegant kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the europa center shopping mall is a stone 's throw away as is the huge kadewe department store .
movie theaters and popular discos are also nearby . " there is something mythic about the station , because it was at the very heart of west berlin life for so many years , " said damianakis . disaffected youth but zoo station did not just represent the glitzy side of life in the fishbowl that was on the front lines of the cold war .
the station was also a magnet for the disaffected youth who hinted at a darker side of postwar west germany 's economic prosperity . berlin was often a destination for young people who wanted to escape the constraints of west german middle-class smugness .
zoo station , in turn , often caught those who fell victim to some of the excesses of these alternative lifestyles .
in the 1970s and 80s , it became known as a gathering place for drop-outs and punks .
the street running along the back of the station , jebensstrasse , became notorious for its prostitution and drug scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that world was documented in a biographical film called " we children from bahnhof zoo . "
based on a biography by christiane felscherinow , it recounts the descent of a teenage young girl into a vortex of drugs and sex for hire , all from the perspective of her and her friends .
the film used the station and its environs as a gritty , hopeless backdrop . in the 1990s , the city stepped in to try and rid the station of its more undesirable elements and improve the atmosphere for the many tourists and commuters who pass through every day .
police patrols were stepped up and in the mid-90s , much of the station was renovated . however , it still serves as a gathering place for the homeless , and teenage prostitutes still ply their trade behind the station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hagen the station has been the topic of books , songs by artists like u2 and nina hagen -lrb- photo -rrb- and a popular musical , called " line 1 , " which tells the story of a west german girl arriving at zoo station to experience life and love in the big city . history zoo station was originally opened in 1882 , but was not a railway station , rather handled traffic for the city 's stadtbahn , or municipal light-rail system .
two years later , long-distance trains began running through the station . in 1902 , the first subway line in berlin , the east-west u2 line , began operation at zoo station .
in the 1930s , a new commuter train , or s-bahn , hall was constructed and the railway hall was expanded .
and in 1961 , the year the berlin wall was built , the north-south u9 subway line also began running through bahnhof zoo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bahnhof zoologischer garten in berlin , aufgenommen im juli 1946 .
foto : landesbildstelle berlin the station had been damaged in the bombing of berlin during wwii and during the final battle for the german capital .
it only reopened for both s-bahn and long-distance trains in 1955 . loss of stature although the station has bounced back from bombs and rehabilitated itself , partially , from its image as the center of berlin 's drug culture , it appears that it will finally fall victim to german reunification . when the wall fell , berlin 's center of gravity shifted back to where it originally was , to the neighborhood of mitte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed train in front of the reichstag zoo station began to lose some of its importance and with last week 's decision by german rail to strike the station from its list of stops for long-distance and high-speed trains , its fate appears to be sealed .

on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies . it was one of the hardest lessons german education had to face .
last year , the educational system that produced thinkers like albert einstein and max planck suffered another humiliation in the worldwide school comparison studies conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- was designed to test how well individual countries were able to educate their primary and high school students at a basic level in reading , mathematics and natural sciences .
in keeping with the previous year , germany failed miserably . germany not only came far behind several asian and other european countries in the pisa rankings ; it fell well under the oecd average in all three categories . since the pisa study began , germany has consistently received poor grades on issues such as government spending on education , number of hours spent in the classroom and pupil-teacher ratios . the country was aghast .
how could germany , a country with a rich history of thinkers , artists and poets , continue to perform so badly ?
the shock of the second damning report in as many years rippled through german politics and the media and stoked a sense of national urgency to improve education .
the result was a concerted effort to reform the german system . reform program to be assessed in internal report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government responded to the last report by increasing government investment in the education system and calling for far-reaching reforms of the nation 's traditional school structure . on thursday , education ministers representing the german states will announce the results of their own internal comparative study of how well things are progressing . however , before the results were announced , the german education system received yet another rap on the knuckles .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator for the oecd , criticized germany on wednesday for its lack of movement on the issue of the country 's three-tiered school model , one of the major points in the suggested reform package announced in 2004 . pisa coordinator unhappy with progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher schleicher complained that the oecd has yet to see any progress .
but german education ministers have argued that a complete revamp of the school system would take between 10 and 15 years . schleicher also called for the introduction of " a school for all , " where pupils would stay together in one system for nine or ten years .
the current division into three different schools , each tailored to specific education abilities and skills , was referred to by one german politician at the time of the last oecd study as one " more befitting of a medieval feudal system than a modern society . " it is a widely held belief that general schools for all pupils are better equipped for promoting common education standards than a system that " sorts " children at an early age according to their abilities .
initial research into the pisa results showed that the traditional division into college-prep high school , secondary school and vocational school , was partially to blame for the poor results in the oecd study .
it also showed that pupils performed better when they learned together . all-day schools remain a prominent issue another factor that the oecd is hoping to see being addressed by the german study is school hours .
the last oecd study showed that german pupils aged seven and eight attend school on average for 626 hours a year , compared with 788 on average in the oecd .
it recommended that germany invest more in building all-day schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd will also be looking for solutions to germany 's problems of large classrooms .
the pupil-teacher ratio at the time of the 2004 review had 24 pupils per teacher in elementary schools , the highest number among the 30 industrial countries surveyed . the results published in berlin on thursday are unlikely to placate the oecd in every area but could at least show improvements in the three core categories of education in which german schools have failed .

a united nations report concluded that grave human rights violations were committed when uzbek troops opened fire on demonstrators in andijan in may .
the us has relied on uzbekistan for military co-operation to carry out missions in neighbouring afghanistan .

it is still to decide whether to release a further $ 22m in aid for this year .
a state department spokesman made clear that the handover of that money would largely depend on whether uzbekistan agreed to an international inquiry .
president karimov has so far rejected those calls , despite un estimates that between 176 and 700 people died when troops opened fire on protestors .
the uzbek government says the protesters were islamic militants trying to seize power , though eyewitnesses dispute this .

john rutter , 42 , is charged with forging her signature on a model release form and attempted grand theft .
the provocative photos were taken in 1992 before diaz was famous .
mark werksman , representing mr rutter , said his client was " guilty of being a nice guy " for giving diaz the first opportunity to buy the photos .
cameron diaz is among hollywood 's highest paid actresses the then 19-year-old model made her screen breakthrough in the mask two years later .
mr rutter is accused of trying to sell the pictures back to the actress in 2003 shortly before shopping them around elsewhere for a reputed $ 5m -lrb- £ 2.8m -rrb- .
by then , diaz was one of the world 's leading actresses and was about to appear in charlie 's angels : full throttle .
she has maintained that she never signed a release form .
' nice guy ' in opening statements , prosecutor david walgren told the jury that mr rutter had presented diaz with " a forged document and , in essence , attempted to blackmail her out of her money . "
mr werksman maintained that the actress had been " willing to literally expose herself " in order to gain exposure .
he added that the case was about " a rich and powerful movie star ... seeking to crush and destroy john rutter " and " forever bury " embarrassing photographs .
diaz starred in charlie 's angels with lucy liu and drew barrymore the case , like so many celebrity trials , appears to come down to the word of a big name star against that of an ordinary mortal .
" i think people are intrigued by celebrities but i do n't think that necessarily means that they believe them more than someone who is not a celebrity , " said steve cron , an la defence lawyer who is familiar with celebrity cases .
during the jury selection process superior court judge michael e pastor attempted to weed out potential members of the panel that may be swayed by the alleged victim 's notoriety .
" who has not heard of the actress cameron diaz , " he asked .
only two people raised their hands .
" i think it 's hard for most people to relate to the lifestyles of the rich and famous - especially if you 're living in an area that 's not as affluent , " said mr cron .
lock and key " in that respect it could work against her if her credibility is an issue . "
by definition , the issue at stake is unique to the celebrity world .
salacious photographs come with a price tag only when their subject is famous .
" it does n't have to be an actress , " said mr cron .
" it could be a politician .
if it was hillary clinton or arnold schwarzenegger in a speedo someone might be willing to pay money for those photographs , but if it 's you or me , unfortunately no-one cares . "
handwriting experts are likely to offer the jurors a professional assessment of whether diaz 's signature was forged .
for now , the photographs at the heart of the case are being kept under lock and key by the authorities .
the judge ordered them to be sealed two years ago - until the dispute is settled .
diaz 's side has argued that the release of the pictures could tarnish her reputation .
the trial is expected to last two weeks .

this has often led to babies being cared for many miles from home , premature baby charity bliss says .
sian matthews-tickner , of lingfield , surrey , has given birth to two premature babies .
her first , jake , was born at 34 weeks weighing 3lb -lrb- 1.36kg -rrb- and was cared for at the family 's local hospital in wales , where they then lived .
sian 's second son alfie , now 20 months old , was born at 25 weeks weighing just under 2lb -lrb- 0.9kg -rrb- .
it put horrendous pressure on the family sian matthews-tickner before his birth , sian was transferred to a hospital in chatham , kent , 50 miles away from her home , which could offer the specialist care she needed .
but , while she was discharged a week after his birth , alfie was kept in for 104 days , meaning the family had to travel to and from chatham each day to see him .
sian , 37 , would travel up every morning , and be home in time to meet her son jake from school .
her husband sean , a fireman , went to see him in the evening .
sian says she calculated that the family travelled 7,000 miles to see alfie over the three months he was in hospital .
she said : " it put horrendous pressure on the family .
" i always thought when people went through a trauma it brought them together .
" but during that time , we argued over the silliest things .
" it got to the point , when alfie was three months old , where i was in tears and had to tell the nurses i could n't afford to put petrol in the car to visit him the next day . "
' no more ' staff at the hospital offered sian money from a charity set up to help people in her situation , but alfie was transferred to their local hospital , so the family had no need to use it .
" it was much better .
i could be there all day .
and my other son could come up and see his brother . "
alfie had a twin , who died in the womb - a fact that was not discovered until sian gave birth and a second foetus was found .
the family now have to visit five hospitals regularly .
jake has learning difficulties , due to being born prematurely , and also suffered a bowel infection at three months old which has had lasting effects .
alfie is profoundly deaf and has branchiootorenal syndrome , a rare genetic disorder which leads to cysts and pits on the neck and in front of the ear .
he also has a chronic lung infection and asthma .
sian said : " i always wanted lots of babies , and i would n't be without my sons .
but i think we 've decided no more now . "

this has often led to babies being cared for many miles from home , premature baby charity bliss says .
sian matthews-tickner , of lingfield , surrey , has given birth to two premature babies .
her first , jake , was born at 34 weeks weighing 3lb -lrb- 1.36kg -rrb- and was cared for at the family 's local hospital in wales , where they then lived .
sian 's second son alfie , now 20 months old , was born at 25 weeks weighing just under 2lb -lrb- 0.9kg -rrb- .
it put horrendous pressure on the family sian matthews-tickner before his birth , sian was transferred to a hospital in chatham , kent , 50 miles away from her home , which could offer the specialist care she needed .
but , while she was discharged a week after his birth , alfie was kept in for 104 days , meaning the family had to travel to and from chatham each day to see him .
sian , 37 , would travel up every morning , and be home in time to meet her son jake from school .
her husband sean , a fireman , went to see him in the evening .
sian says she calculated that the family travelled 7,000 miles to see alfie over the three months he was in hospital .
she said : " it put horrendous pressure on the family .
" i always thought when people went through a trauma it brought them together .
" but during that time , we argued over the silliest things .
" it got to the point , when alfie was three months old , where i was in tears and had to tell the nurses i could n't afford to put petrol in the car to visit him the next day . "
' no more ' staff at the hospital offered sian money from a charity set up to help people in her situation , but alfie was transferred to their local hospital , so the family had no need to use it .
" it was much better .
i could be there all day .
and my other son could come up and see his brother . "
alfie had a twin , who died in the womb - a fact that was not discovered until sian gave birth and a second foetus was found .
the family now have to visit five hospitals regularly .
jake has learning difficulties , due to being born prematurely , and also suffered a bowel infection at three months old which has had lasting effects .
alfie is profoundly deaf and has branchiootorenal syndrome , a rare genetic disorder which leads to cysts and pits on the neck and in front of the ear .
he also has a chronic lung infection and asthma .
