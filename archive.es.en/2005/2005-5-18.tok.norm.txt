program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2005 germany concerned by fundamentalism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily called for zero tolerance towards enemies of the constitution the domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution , presented its annual report in berlin tuesday .
both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .
yet government efforts , including new anti-terror laws introduced in 2002 , he said , had proved successful in 2004 . " we were able to improve substantially surveillance and intelligence-gathering , " he said , " which is a precondition for curbing islamic terrorism .
the establishment of a national counter-terrorism centre last year has accelerated the processing and analyzing of important information , enabling us to reach a new level in the fight against terrorism . " in 2004 , the report says , german authorities were able to ban two fundamentalist organizations operating here .
among them was the so-called al-aqsa association , which had been collecting money to finance terrorist activities , and a turkish newspaper spreading anti-jewish propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further successes , schily said , were 171 cases brought against terror suspects in german courts .
they included the trial of three iraqi citizens who were allegedly plotting to kill the former iraqi prime minister iyad allawi -lrb- pictured , center -rrb- during a visit to germany last year . new concerns but the report also revealed that 2004 had seen the emergence of new worries , primarily regarding right-wing violence and extremism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right crimes jumped by 10 percent to 12051 incidents .
and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .
they launched a campaign codenamed ' schoolyard ' in which they were planning to distribute 50,000 cds containing inflammatory neo-nazi music to schoolchildren .
thanks to vigilant citizens , the authorities were alerted and were able to foil their plans . " increased public awareness the german interior minister made an impassioned plea for greater public awareness in the fight against right-wing and anti-foreigner sentiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal changes , schily said , that had , for example , prevented the npd from marching past berlin 's holocaust memorial at the recent anniversary of the end of world war two , were only part of the battle .
what had been really impressive on that day , he said , were the thousands of counter-demonstrators who stopped the neo-nazis from marching in berlin at all . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough times for muslims in europe a report by human-rights watchdogs confirms something many europeans may have noticed on their own : life has gotten harder for muslims in europe since the terror attacks of sept .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .

swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas nadeem elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the central council of muslims in germany , believes his fellow muslims would have to remain cool if something similar were to happen in germany .
" muslims must be certain that such cases would be prosecuted , " he said .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .

german scholars ines geipel and joachim walther in 2001 began compiling an archive of work by oppressed east german writers , silenced by persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wanted to give young people in particular an image of east germany that goes beyond those ghastly nostalgia shows , " said geipel in an interview with german public broadcaster ndr .
edeltraud eckert , radjo monk , heidemarie härtl and peter voss might not be household names , but once their work is published by edition büchergilde within its " silent library " series that might finally change .
tragic fate penned while she was serving time in the women 's hoheneck prison for political activism , eckert 's poetry , collected in a volume entitled " year without spring " is the first to hit the press .
she died after a horrific accident in the prison workroom in 1955 , aged just 25 .
over the next five years , büchergilde will be publishing another 19 unknown writers whose talents were curbed by state socialism and who failed to reach a more sympathetic readership in the west .
" people were oppressed , " said walther in an interview with der spiegel .
" they were n't allowed to write what they wanted .
in many cases , their lives were ruined .
the official canon needs to be reformed to reflect this part of history . "
silenced voices the former east germany was notoriously ruthless with enemies of the state , including cultural subversives .
writers who dared criticize the oppressive regime were given short shrift - barred , at the very least , from their chosen career , sent to jail and often dispatched to labor camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa wolf a host of high-profile authors from behind germany 's iron curtain were luckier , managing to package veiled criticism in work that the east germany dictatorship was willing to tolerate .
while writers including christa wolf , anna seghers , heiner müller and stefan heym found ways of co-existing within a system they saw as flawed , angrier , more outspoken voices were unceremoniously silenced .
unofficial networks overlooked amid a backlash against many of east germany 's leading writers , accused of collaborating with the infamous stasi secret service , the fate of the gdr 's more extreme literary dissidents was largely ignored in the years following the fall of the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " silent library " project was a painstaking undertaking .
geipel and walther scoured diverse sources from stasi archives -lrb- photo -rrb- , the german literature archive and the academy of arts to regional literary magazines published during the communist era .
" we 're both writers ourselves , " geipel told ndr .
" we knew about east germany 's unofficial literary networks and how they worked . "
until now , these writers were not even footnotes in germany 's literary history .

during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .

that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas nadeem elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the central council of muslims in germany , believes his fellow muslims would have to remain cool if something similar were to happen in germany .
" muslims must be certain that such cases would be prosecuted , " he said .
" what we definitely do n't want are death threats or a new round of incitements - from our side .
if that were to happen , we would only be doing our opponents a favor .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

"
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .
during the war years , this field was one of the institute 's man research areas . " in 1942 , josef mengele 's former professor othmar von verschuer was made director of the institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in dahlem , berlin .
he and his protégé went on to work together on the two eugenics projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mengele sent blood samples from some 200 patients of various race to his partner at the berlin institute , while karin magnussen received human parts from the notorious concentration camp , such as eyes taken from a dead sinti family . who else was involved ? it seems likely that these scientists were n't the only researchers receiving nazi support for their studies on heredity and eugenics . " department head wolfgang abel may have also been profiting from deliveries from the concentration camp in auschwitz , " said schuhl , " as well as hans grebe , another one of verschuer 's students , whose work concentrating on hereditary physical deformities .
we do n't know that for sure , but that is our considered opinion . " mengele : monster or middle man ? what role did josef mengele play in the development of this research ?
was he really the " angel of death , " or was he just a gifted scientist taking orders from the third reich 's elite research centers , such as the kaiser wilhelm institute ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's a very controversial question , " explained schmuhl .
" he was n't literally taking orders , because the kaiser wilhelm institute -lrb- photo -rrb- was n't in a position to issue instructions to a camp physician , who was part of the ss hierarchy .
it was basically a network of colleagues , although as mengele 's mentor , verschuer had a certain authority over his former student .
rumor has it that mengele was working on his postdoctoral thesis in auschwitz , which was being supervised by verschuer .
that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .
in that sense , he was taking orders . " perhaps mengele was just the middle man , but he was able to carry out his work thanks to the academic infra-structure of nazi germany , kept well-oiled by fervent believers in the master-race . basic human rights suspended " it 's important to stress that there were never any fixed hierarchies , " said schmuhl .
" instead , there were horizontal networks , which is typical of the science community . people do n't tend to work alone , they work together - drawing colleagues ' attention to interesting cases , providing samples and son on .
it always works like that , and that 's how it worked in the third reich . " the difference was that nazi death camps meant scientists were able to conduct experiments that could never have taken place before . " it was war-time , " pointed out schmuhl .
" there were prisoner of war camps and extermination camps , where basic human rights had been suspended .
it would be easy to accuse the scientists in dahlem of failing to think about the morality of their actions .
they accepted human samples without bothering to ask who had to die first . " many of the scientists incriminated in these cases were never even prosecuted in the post-war years .
after disappearing in 1945 , josef mengele allegedly drowned in brazil in 1979 .
karin magnussen was simply deemed a nazi " fellow traveler , " and spent twenty years as a biology teacher in bremen before dying in 1997 at the age of 89 . most spurious of all was the fate of othmar von verschuer .
he remained a respected scientist in germany and became dean of the university of münster , as well as an honorary member of numerous scientific societies . vivi papanayotou -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mengele hometown opens victim memorial the hometown of nazi war criminal josef mengele opened a memorial to his victims tuesday aimed as an indelible reminder of the horrors of german history .

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .
what might do it , however , is a " yes " to the eu constitution , but the chances of that actually happening look nothing if not remote . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair critics muted british prime minister tony blair received a standing ovation and broad support wednesday from his labour party for his election victory as critics demanding his resignation were silenced , party members said .

both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .
yet government efforts , including new anti-terror laws introduced in 2002 , he said , had proved successful in 2004 . " we were able to improve substantially surveillance and intelligence-gathering , " he said , " which is a precondition for curbing islamic terrorism .

and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .
they launched a campaign codenamed ' schoolyard ' in which they were planning to distribute 50,000 cds containing inflammatory neo-nazi music to schoolchildren .

but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .
yet government efforts , including new anti-terror laws introduced in 2002 , he said , had proved successful in 2004 . " we were able to improve substantially surveillance and intelligence-gathering , " he said , " which is a precondition for curbing islamic terrorism .
the establishment of a national counter-terrorism centre last year has accelerated the processing and analyzing of important information , enabling us to reach a new level in the fight against terrorism . " in 2004 , the report says , german authorities were able to ban two fundamentalist organizations operating here .
among them was the so-called al-aqsa association , which had been collecting money to finance terrorist activities , and a turkish newspaper spreading anti-jewish propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further successes , schily said , were 171 cases brought against terror suspects in german courts .
they included the trial of three iraqi citizens who were allegedly plotting to kill the former iraqi prime minister iyad allawi -lrb- pictured , center -rrb- during a visit to germany last year . new concerns but the report also revealed that 2004 had seen the emergence of new worries , primarily regarding right-wing violence and extremism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right crimes jumped by 10 percent to 12051 incidents .
and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .
they launched a campaign codenamed ' schoolyard ' in which they were planning to distribute 50,000 cds containing inflammatory neo-nazi music to schoolchildren .
thanks to vigilant citizens , the authorities were alerted and were able to foil their plans . " increased public awareness the german interior minister made an impassioned plea for greater public awareness in the fight against right-wing and anti-foreigner sentiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal changes , schily said , that had , for example , prevented the npd from marching past berlin 's holocaust memorial at the recent anniversary of the end of world war two , were only part of the battle .
what had been really impressive on that day , he said , were the thousands of counter-demonstrators who stopped the neo-nazis from marching in berlin at all . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough times for muslims in europe a report by human-rights watchdogs confirms something many europeans may have noticed on their own : life has gotten harder for muslims in europe since the terror attacks of sept .

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .

but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .
yet government efforts , including new anti-terror laws introduced in 2002 , he said , had proved successful in 2004 . " we were able to improve substantially surveillance and intelligence-gathering , " he said , " which is a precondition for curbing islamic terrorism .
the establishment of a national counter-terrorism centre last year has accelerated the processing and analyzing of important information , enabling us to reach a new level in the fight against terrorism . " in 2004 , the report says , german authorities were able to ban two fundamentalist organizations operating here .
among them was the so-called al-aqsa association , which had been collecting money to finance terrorist activities , and a turkish newspaper spreading anti-jewish propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further successes , schily said , were 171 cases brought against terror suspects in german courts .
they included the trial of three iraqi citizens who were allegedly plotting to kill the former iraqi prime minister iyad allawi -lrb- pictured , center -rrb- during a visit to germany last year . new concerns but the report also revealed that 2004 had seen the emergence of new worries , primarily regarding right-wing violence and extremism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right crimes jumped by 10 percent to 12051 incidents .
and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .
they launched a campaign codenamed ' schoolyard ' in which they were planning to distribute 50,000 cds containing inflammatory neo-nazi music to schoolchildren .
thanks to vigilant citizens , the authorities were alerted and were able to foil their plans . " increased public awareness the german interior minister made an impassioned plea for greater public awareness in the fight against right-wing and anti-foreigner sentiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal changes , schily said , that had , for example , prevented the npd from marching past berlin 's holocaust memorial at the recent anniversary of the end of world war two , were only part of the battle .
what had been really impressive on that day , he said , were the thousands of counter-demonstrators who stopped the neo-nazis from marching in berlin at all . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough times for muslims in europe a report by human-rights watchdogs confirms something many europeans may have noticed on their own : life has gotten harder for muslims in europe since the terror attacks of sept .

cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm .
a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " künast said .
" that is why i support a ban on advertising which shows smoking as something cool . "
germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgment .
germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman volker nickel said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . dw-world.de minister wants cigarette additives banned italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.05.2005 silenced gdr writers finally given a voice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former east germany discredited dissenting writers sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , a new canon of outlawed east german writers is about to be published for the first time . german literature is poised to welcome some 20 prodigal sons and daughters into its fold , under the aegis of a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the east german dictatorship .
german scholars ines geipel and joachim walther in 2001 began compiling an archive of work by oppressed east german writers , silenced by persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wanted to give young people in particular an image of east germany that goes beyond those ghastly nostalgia shows , " said geipel in an interview with german public broadcaster ndr .
edeltraud eckert , radjo monk , heidemarie härtl and peter voss might not be household names , but once their work is published by edition büchergilde within its " silent library " series that might finally change .
tragic fate penned while she was serving time in the women 's hoheneck prison for political activism , eckert 's poetry , collected in a volume entitled " year without spring " is the first to hit the press .
she died after a horrific accident in the prison workroom in 1955 , aged just 25 .
over the next five years , büchergilde will be publishing another 19 unknown writers whose talents were curbed by state socialism and who failed to reach a more sympathetic readership in the west .
" people were oppressed , " said walther in an interview with der spiegel .
" they were n't allowed to write what they wanted .
in many cases , their lives were ruined .
the official canon needs to be reformed to reflect this part of history . "
silenced voices the former east germany was notoriously ruthless with enemies of the state , including cultural subversives .
writers who dared criticize the oppressive regime were given short shrift - barred , at the very least , from their chosen career , sent to jail and often dispatched to labor camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa wolf a host of high-profile authors from behind germany 's iron curtain were luckier , managing to package veiled criticism in work that the east germany dictatorship was willing to tolerate .
while writers including christa wolf , anna seghers , heiner müller and stefan heym found ways of co-existing within a system they saw as flawed , angrier , more outspoken voices were unceremoniously silenced .
unofficial networks overlooked amid a backlash against many of east germany 's leading writers , accused of collaborating with the infamous stasi secret service , the fate of the gdr 's more extreme literary dissidents was largely ignored in the years following the fall of the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " silent library " project was a painstaking undertaking .
geipel and walther scoured diverse sources from stasi archives -lrb- photo -rrb- , the german literature archive and the academy of arts to regional literary magazines published during the communist era .
" we 're both writers ourselves , " geipel told ndr .
" we knew about east germany 's unofficial literary networks and how they worked . "
until now , these writers were not even footnotes in germany 's literary history .
now , albeit belatedly , they might just become bestsellers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german architecture 's second chance a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . " it raised the question of just how far the state will interfere with people 's right to make their own decisions , " nickel told german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans and their vices the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . " it raised the question of just how far the state will interfere with people 's right to make their own decisions , " nickel told german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans and their vices the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .

but berlin remains confident it will eventually garner washington 's support . according to the washington post 's wednesday edition , rice expressed her opposition while meeting with members of a congressional task force considering reform of the united nations .
the newspaper quoted from a confidential memorandum of a may 5 meeting between rice , former house speaker newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george j. mitchell . " -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .

their proposal calls for expanding security council from the current 15 members to 25 . the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on . the revamp of un institutions would need the support of 128 un member countries , but the opposition of one of the permanent five security council members could veto the proposal .

both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .

the establishment of a national counter-terrorism centre last year has accelerated the processing and analyzing of important information , enabling us to reach a new level in the fight against terrorism .

they included the trial of three iraqi citizens who were allegedly plotting to kill the former iraqi prime minister iyad allawi -lrb- pictured , center -rrb- during a visit to germany last year . new concerns but the report also revealed that 2004 had seen the emergence of new worries , primarily regarding right-wing violence and extremism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right crimes jumped by 10 percent to 12051 incidents .
and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .
they launched a campaign codenamed ' schoolyard ' in which they were planning to distribute 50,000 cds containing inflammatory neo-nazi music to schoolchildren .
thanks to vigilant citizens , the authorities were alerted and were able to foil their plans .

both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .
yet government efforts , including new anti-terror laws introduced in 2002 , he said , had proved successful in 2004 . " we were able to improve substantially surveillance and intelligence-gathering , " he said , " which is a precondition for curbing islamic terrorism .
the establishment of a national counter-terrorism centre last year has accelerated the processing and analyzing of important information , enabling us to reach a new level in the fight against terrorism . " in 2004 , the report says , german authorities were able to ban two fundamentalist organizations operating here .
among them was the so-called al-aqsa association , which had been collecting money to finance terrorist activities , and a turkish newspaper spreading anti-jewish propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further successes , schily said , were 171 cases brought against terror suspects in german courts .
they included the trial of three iraqi citizens who were allegedly plotting to kill the former iraqi prime minister iyad allawi -lrb- pictured , center -rrb- during a visit to germany last year . new concerns but the report also revealed that 2004 had seen the emergence of new worries , primarily regarding right-wing violence and extremism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right crimes jumped by 10 percent to 12051 incidents .
and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .
they launched a campaign codenamed ' schoolyard ' in which they were planning to distribute 50,000 cds containing inflammatory neo-nazi music to schoolchildren .
thanks to vigilant citizens , the authorities were alerted and were able to foil their plans . " increased public awareness the german interior minister made an impassioned plea for greater public awareness in the fight against right-wing and anti-foreigner sentiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal changes , schily said , that had , for example , prevented the npd from marching past berlin 's holocaust memorial at the recent anniversary of the end of world war two , were only part of the battle .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas nadeem elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the central council of muslims in germany , believes his fellow muslims would have to remain cool if something similar were to happen in germany .
" muslims must be certain that such cases would be prosecuted , " he said .

swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .

charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .

will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .

iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .

that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .

german scholars ines geipel and joachim walther in 2001 began compiling an archive of work by oppressed east german writers , silenced by persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wanted to give young people in particular an image of east germany that goes beyond those ghastly nostalgia shows , " said geipel in an interview with german public broadcaster ndr .
edeltraud eckert , radjo monk , heidemarie härtl and peter voss might not be household names , but once their work is published by edition büchergilde within its " silent library " series that might finally change .
tragic fate penned while she was serving time in the women 's hoheneck prison for political activism , eckert 's poetry , collected in a volume entitled " year without spring " is the first to hit the press .
she died after a horrific accident in the prison workroom in 1955 , aged just 25 .
over the next five years , büchergilde will be publishing another 19 unknown writers whose talents were curbed by state socialism and who failed to reach a more sympathetic readership in the west .
" people were oppressed , " said walther in an interview with der spiegel .
" they were n't allowed to write what they wanted .
in many cases , their lives were ruined .
the official canon needs to be reformed to reflect this part of history . "
silenced voices the former east germany was notoriously ruthless with enemies of the state , including cultural subversives .
writers who dared criticize the oppressive regime were given short shrift - barred , at the very least , from their chosen career , sent to jail and often dispatched to labor camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa wolf a host of high-profile authors from behind germany 's iron curtain were luckier , managing to package veiled criticism in work that the east germany dictatorship was willing to tolerate .
while writers including christa wolf , anna seghers , heiner müller and stefan heym found ways of co-existing within a system they saw as flawed , angrier , more outspoken voices were unceremoniously silenced .
unofficial networks overlooked amid a backlash against many of east germany 's leading writers , accused of collaborating with the infamous stasi secret service , the fate of the gdr 's more extreme literary dissidents was largely ignored in the years following the fall of the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " silent library " project was a painstaking undertaking .
geipel and walther scoured diverse sources from stasi archives -lrb- photo -rrb- , the german literature archive and the academy of arts to regional literary magazines published during the communist era .
" we 're both writers ourselves , " geipel told ndr .
" we knew about east germany 's unofficial literary networks and how they worked . "
until now , these writers were not even footnotes in germany 's literary history .
now , albeit belatedly , they might just become bestsellers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german architecture 's second chance a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . " it raised the question of just how far the state will interfere with people 's right to make their own decisions , " nickel told german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans and their vices the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .

-lrb- august 26 , 2004 -rrb- minister wants cigarette additives banned italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2005 german drug deaths drop to 15-year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fears gateway drugs will lead to more dangerous addictions the number of deaths from the use of illegal drugs in germany has fallen to the lowest level in 15 years despite a growing number of youths trying cannabis and amphetamines in 2004 , according to a government report . berlin 's official annual report unveiled on wednesday painted a mixed picture of drug use in germany .
a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . " it raised the question of just how far the state will interfere with people 's right to make their own decisions , " nickel told german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans and their vices the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .

the newspaper quoted from a confidential memorandum of a may 5 meeting between rice , former house speaker newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george j. mitchell . " -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .
what might do it , however , is a " yes " to the eu constitution , but the chances of that actually happening look nothing if not remote . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair critics muted british prime minister tony blair received a standing ovation and broad support wednesday from his labour party for his election victory as critics demanding his resignation were silenced , party members said .

but berlin remains confident it will eventually garner washington 's support . according to the washington post 's wednesday edition , rice expressed her opposition while meeting with members of a congressional task force considering reform of the united nations .
the newspaper quoted from a confidential memorandum of a may 5 meeting between rice , former house speaker newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george j. mitchell . " -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .
" in many respects , europe already had a common foreign policy , and that needed to be taken into account in the security council . " g4 proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second form right and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
only on tuesday , germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the four are leading candidates for permanent seats .
their proposal calls for expanding security council from the current 15 members to 25 . the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on . the revamp of un institutions would need the support of 128 un member countries , but the opposition of one of the permanent five security council members could veto the proposal .
if washington is opposed to berlin 's bid , the entire reform could be shelved .
china has already expressed concern over making japan a permanent member . berlin stays upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york despite the memo detailing rice 's reservations , german officials remained upbeat that washington had not yet decided to torpedo germany 's un aspirations .
wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , told the washington post that the united states has not taken an official position .
he added that the latest proposal would actually address rice 's concerns about overall european representation on the security council . " the bottom line is that our proposal would not increase , but decrease , the relative weight of europe , " ischinger said .
" i think that is a very , very strong argument . " german government spokesman thomas steg also focused on the preliminary nature of the debate over un reform on wednesday .
he said berlin was optimistic there would eventually be broad support for the g4 proposal . " the process of discussion has just started and will pick up pace as it continues in new york , " steg said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts un reform resolution germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .

" eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , launching an emergency procedure allowed under world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules and called for consultations with beijing on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn .
the eu will impose " temporary " and " reasonable " limits on imports of the two sectors if china does not take voluntary action to rein in its booming exports by the end of a 90-day period , mandelson told afp .
china promises its own measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it will take its own action meanwhile , china 's commerce ministry said tuesday it was unaware of plans by the european union to slap quotas on chinese textile exports until the end of 2005 .
" we have not heard about this , " said an official at china 's commerce ministry , declining to comment further . chinese premier wen jiabao last week promised more measures to curb rampant growth in textile exports to the eu .
he said beijing would " take further effective measures to strengthen our guidance and control on textile enterprises , to adopt economic measures to control the rapid growth of some textile products and clothing exports . " exports surged 534 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding the european market the eu 's executive commission launched an investigation into select textile and garment categories from china last month after compiling evidence that exports surged by as much as 534 percent after a 31-year-old global quota system ended in january .
normally , the investigation is supposed to last a maximum of 60 days during which informal consultations are to be held between brussels and beijing to try to find a solution .
but some eu textile producers have been urging the eu to adopt emergency procedures , which would fast-forward the process to a much more serious formal consultation period . but so far , the commission has only pushed for talks .

" eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , launching an emergency procedure allowed under world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules and called for consultations with beijing on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn .
the eu will impose " temporary " and " reasonable " limits on imports of the two sectors if china does not take voluntary action to rein in its booming exports by the end of a 90-day period , mandelson told afp .

" we have not heard about this , " said an official at china 's commerce ministry , declining to comment further . chinese premier wen jiabao last week promised more measures to curb rampant growth in textile exports to the eu .
he said beijing would " take further effective measures to strengthen our guidance and control on textile enterprises , to adopt economic measures to control the rapid growth of some textile products and clothing exports .

normally , the investigation is supposed to last a maximum of 60 days during which informal consultations are to be held between brussels and beijing to try to find a solution .
but some eu textile producers have been urging the eu to adopt emergency procedures , which would fast-forward the process to a much more serious formal consultation period . but so far , the commission has only pushed for talks .

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .
what might do it , however , is a " yes " to the eu constitution , but the chances of that actually happening look nothing if not remote . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair critics muted british prime minister tony blair received a standing ovation and broad support wednesday from his labour party for his election victory as critics demanding his resignation were silenced , party members said .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .

german scholars ines geipel and joachim walther in 2001 began compiling an archive of work by oppressed east german writers , silenced by persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wanted to give young people in particular an image of east germany that goes beyond those ghastly nostalgia shows , " said geipel in an interview with german public broadcaster ndr .
edeltraud eckert , radjo monk , heidemarie härtl and peter voss might not be household names , but once their work is published by edition büchergilde within its " silent library " series that might finally change .
tragic fate penned while she was serving time in the women 's hoheneck prison for political activism , eckert 's poetry , collected in a volume entitled " year without spring " is the first to hit the press .
she died after a horrific accident in the prison workroom in 1955 , aged just 25 .
over the next five years , büchergilde will be publishing another 19 unknown writers whose talents were curbed by state socialism and who failed to reach a more sympathetic readership in the west .
" people were oppressed , " said walther in an interview with der spiegel .
" they were n't allowed to write what they wanted .
in many cases , their lives were ruined .
the official canon needs to be reformed to reflect this part of history . "
silenced voices the former east germany was notoriously ruthless with enemies of the state , including cultural subversives .
writers who dared criticize the oppressive regime were given short shrift - barred , at the very least , from their chosen career , sent to jail and often dispatched to labor camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa wolf a host of high-profile authors from behind germany 's iron curtain were luckier , managing to package veiled criticism in work that the east germany dictatorship was willing to tolerate .
while writers including christa wolf , anna seghers , heiner müller and stefan heym found ways of co-existing within a system they saw as flawed , angrier , more outspoken voices were unceremoniously silenced .
unofficial networks overlooked amid a backlash against many of east germany 's leading writers , accused of collaborating with the infamous stasi secret service , the fate of the gdr 's more extreme literary dissidents was largely ignored in the years following the fall of the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " silent library " project was a painstaking undertaking .
geipel and walther scoured diverse sources from stasi archives -lrb- photo -rrb- , the german literature archive and the academy of arts to regional literary magazines published during the communist era .
" we 're both writers ourselves , " geipel told ndr .
" we knew about east germany 's unofficial literary networks and how they worked . "
until now , these writers were not even footnotes in germany 's literary history .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .

tragic fate penned while she was serving time in the women 's hoheneck prison for political activism , eckert 's poetry , collected in a volume entitled " year without spring " is the first to hit the press .
she died after a horrific accident in the prison workroom in 1955 , aged just 25 .
over the next five years , büchergilde will be publishing another 19 unknown writers whose talents were curbed by state socialism and who failed to reach a more sympathetic readership in the west .
" people were oppressed , " said walther in an interview with der spiegel .
" they were n't allowed to write what they wanted .
in many cases , their lives were ruined .
the official canon needs to be reformed to reflect this part of history . "
silenced voices the former east germany was notoriously ruthless with enemies of the state , including cultural subversives .
writers who dared criticize the oppressive regime were given short shrift - barred , at the very least , from their chosen career , sent to jail and often dispatched to labor camps .

while writers including christa wolf , anna seghers , heiner müller and stefan heym found ways of co-existing within a system they saw as flawed , angrier , more outspoken voices were unceremoniously silenced .
unofficial networks overlooked amid a backlash against many of east germany 's leading writers , accused of collaborating with the infamous stasi secret service , the fate of the gdr 's more extreme literary dissidents was largely ignored in the years following the fall of the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " silent library " project was a painstaking undertaking .
geipel and walther scoured diverse sources from stasi archives -lrb- photo -rrb- , the german literature archive and the academy of arts to regional literary magazines published during the communist era .
" we 're both writers ourselves , " geipel told ndr .
" we knew about east germany 's unofficial literary networks and how they worked . "

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .
künast published a list of about 200 cigarette additives on the internet wednesday and wants those deemed carcinogenic or addictive banned - throughout europe . " if they cause cancer , they have to go , " she told berliner morgenpost daily on tuesday . the list - over 1,100 pages - includes such seemingly neutral items such as cocoa or honey , harmless by themselves but combined with other additives in cigarettes potentially cancerous .
subsequently , researchers are set to investigate each ingredient for its harmful effects . in this way , smokers , who number about 17 million in germany , can inform themselves as to what exactly is in cigarettes and what harm they do , officials say . not a solution by itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating the additives health experts have long held that the tobacco industry inserts ingredients to make people more quickly addicted .
künast also said that certain ingredients , such as honey , attracted younger people to cigarettes more effectively . a leading german researcher in addiction said he welcomed the plan but warned that it is not a panacea in the war against smoking . " the number of smokers has to be reduced , " rolf hüllinghorst told berliner morgenpost .
" but we need the government to implement its complete action plan against smoking , created two years ago . " list will only irritiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raise taxes , some say meanwhile , opposition politicians attacked the initiative saying it was n't an effective weapon against cigarettes and that it wo n't terrify smokers , only irritate them . " it is a contradictory approach , " cdu bundestag member helmut heiderich told the berliner morgenpost . he and other members of the bundestag 's committee on consumer affairs want further tax hikes on tobacco , which have proved effective in reducing the number of smokers . at the same time , heiderich 's cdu colleague , karl-heiny florenz , the head of the european parliament 's health committee told bild daily that there should be a total ban on cigarettes : " cigarettes are a dangerous weapon and need to be removed from the marketplace .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .
künast published a list of about 200 cigarette additives on the internet wednesday and wants those deemed carcinogenic or addictive banned - throughout europe . " if they cause cancer , they have to go , " she told berliner morgenpost daily on tuesday . the list - over 1,100 pages - includes such seemingly neutral items such as cocoa or honey , harmless by themselves but combined with other additives in cigarettes potentially cancerous .
subsequently , researchers are set to investigate each ingredient for its harmful effects . in this way , smokers , who number about 17 million in germany , can inform themselves as to what exactly is in cigarettes and what harm they do , officials say . not a solution by itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating the additives health experts have long held that the tobacco industry inserts ingredients to make people more quickly addicted .
künast also said that certain ingredients , such as honey , attracted younger people to cigarettes more effectively . a leading german researcher in addiction said he welcomed the plan but warned that it is not a panacea in the war against smoking . " the number of smokers has to be reduced , " rolf hüllinghorst told berliner morgenpost .
" but we need the government to implement its complete action plan against smoking , created two years ago . " list will only irritiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raise taxes , some say meanwhile , opposition politicians attacked the initiative saying it was n't an effective weapon against cigarettes and that it wo n't terrify smokers , only irritate them . " it is a contradictory approach , " cdu bundestag member helmut heiderich told the berliner morgenpost . he and other members of the bundestag 's committee on consumer affairs want further tax hikes on tobacco , which have proved effective in reducing the number of smokers . at the same time , heiderich 's cdu colleague , karl-heiny florenz , the head of the european parliament 's health committee told bild daily that there should be a total ban on cigarettes : " cigarettes are a dangerous weapon and need to be removed from the marketplace .

both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .
yet government efforts , including new anti-terror laws introduced in 2002 , he said , had proved successful in 2004 . " we were able to improve substantially surveillance and intelligence-gathering , " he said , " which is a precondition for curbing islamic terrorism .
the establishment of a national counter-terrorism centre last year has accelerated the processing and analyzing of important information , enabling us to reach a new level in the fight against terrorism . " in 2004 , the report says , german authorities were able to ban two fundamentalist organizations operating here .
among them was the so-called al-aqsa association , which had been collecting money to finance terrorist activities , and a turkish newspaper spreading anti-jewish propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further successes , schily said , were 171 cases brought against terror suspects in german courts .
they included the trial of three iraqi citizens who were allegedly plotting to kill the former iraqi prime minister iyad allawi -lrb- pictured , center -rrb- during a visit to germany last year . new concerns but the report also revealed that 2004 had seen the emergence of new worries , primarily regarding right-wing violence and extremism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right crimes jumped by 10 percent to 12051 incidents .
and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .
they launched a campaign codenamed ' schoolyard ' in which they were planning to distribute 50,000 cds containing inflammatory neo-nazi music to schoolchildren .
thanks to vigilant citizens , the authorities were alerted and were able to foil their plans . " increased public awareness the german interior minister made an impassioned plea for greater public awareness in the fight against right-wing and anti-foreigner sentiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal changes , schily said , that had , for example , prevented the npd from marching past berlin 's holocaust memorial at the recent anniversary of the end of world war two , were only part of the battle .

both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .
künast published a list of about 200 cigarette additives on the internet wednesday and wants those deemed carcinogenic or addictive banned - throughout europe . " if they cause cancer , they have to go , " she told berliner morgenpost daily on tuesday . the list - over 1,100 pages - includes such seemingly neutral items such as cocoa or honey , harmless by themselves but combined with other additives in cigarettes potentially cancerous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.05.2005 britain , blair , brown and europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair in the backseat ?
tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .
what might do it , however , is a " yes " to the eu constitution , but the chances of that actually happening look nothing if not remote . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair critics muted british prime minister tony blair received a standing ovation and broad support wednesday from his labour party for his election victory as critics demanding his resignation were silenced , party members said .

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .

now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .
künast published a list of about 200 cigarette additives on the internet wednesday and wants those deemed carcinogenic or addictive banned - throughout europe . " if they cause cancer , they have to go , " she told berliner morgenpost daily on tuesday . the list - over 1,100 pages - includes such seemingly neutral items such as cocoa or honey , harmless by themselves but combined with other additives in cigarettes potentially cancerous .

cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm .
a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " künast said .
" that is why i support a ban on advertising which shows smoking as something cool . "
germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgment .
germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman volker nickel said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . dw-world.de minister wants cigarette additives banned italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers .

german scholars ines geipel and joachim walther in 2001 began compiling an archive of work by oppressed east german writers , silenced by persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wanted to give young people in particular an image of east germany that goes beyond those ghastly nostalgia shows , " said geipel in an interview with german public broadcaster ndr .
edeltraud eckert , radjo monk , heidemarie härtl and peter voss might not be household names , but once their work is published by edition büchergilde within its " silent library " series that might finally change .
tragic fate penned while she was serving time in the women 's hoheneck prison for political activism , eckert 's poetry , collected in a volume entitled " year without spring " is the first to hit the press .
she died after a horrific accident in the prison workroom in 1955 , aged just 25 .
over the next five years , büchergilde will be publishing another 19 unknown writers whose talents were curbed by state socialism and who failed to reach a more sympathetic readership in the west .
" people were oppressed , " said walther in an interview with der spiegel .
" they were n't allowed to write what they wanted .
in many cases , their lives were ruined .
the official canon needs to be reformed to reflect this part of history . "

"
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .

"
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .
during the war years , this field was one of the institute 's man research areas . " in 1942 , josef mengele 's former professor othmar von verschuer was made director of the institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in dahlem , berlin .
he and his protégé went on to work together on the two eugenics projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mengele sent blood samples from some 200 patients of various race to his partner at the berlin institute , while karin magnussen received human parts from the notorious concentration camp , such as eyes taken from a dead sinti family . who else was involved ? it seems likely that these scientists were n't the only researchers receiving nazi support for their studies on heredity and eugenics . " department head wolfgang abel may have also been profiting from deliveries from the concentration camp in auschwitz , " said schuhl , " as well as hans grebe , another one of verschuer 's students , whose work concentrating on hereditary physical deformities .
we do n't know that for sure , but that is our considered opinion . " mengele : monster or middle man ? what role did josef mengele play in the development of this research ?
was he really the " angel of death , " or was he just a gifted scientist taking orders from the third reich 's elite research centers , such as the kaiser wilhelm institute ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's a very controversial question , " explained schmuhl .
" he was n't literally taking orders , because the kaiser wilhelm institute -lrb- photo -rrb- was n't in a position to issue instructions to a camp physician , who was part of the ss hierarchy .
it was basically a network of colleagues , although as mengele 's mentor , verschuer had a certain authority over his former student .
rumor has it that mengele was working on his postdoctoral thesis in auschwitz , which was being supervised by verschuer .
that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .

that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.05.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm .
a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " künast said .
" that is why i support a ban on advertising which shows smoking as something cool . "
germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgment .
germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman volker nickel said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . dw-world.de minister wants cigarette additives banned italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2005 hate-preachers can expect prosecution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do preachers of hatred belong in front of these judges ?
preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas nadeem elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the central council of muslims in germany , believes his fellow muslims would have to remain cool if something similar were to happen in germany .
" muslims must be certain that such cases would be prosecuted , " he said .
" what we definitely do n't want are death threats or a new round of incitements - from our side .
if that were to happen , we would only be doing our opponents a favor .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .

cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm .
a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " künast said .
" that is why i support a ban on advertising which shows smoking as something cool . "
germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgment .
germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman volker nickel said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . dw-world.de minister wants cigarette additives banned italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .

the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . " it raised the question of just how far the state will interfere with people 's right to make their own decisions , " nickel told german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans and their vices the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .

but berlin remains confident it will eventually garner washington 's support . according to the washington post 's wednesday edition , rice expressed her opposition while meeting with members of a congressional task force considering reform of the united nations .
the newspaper quoted from a confidential memorandum of a may 5 meeting between rice , former house speaker newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george j. mitchell . " -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .
" in many respects , europe already had a common foreign policy , and that needed to be taken into account in the security council . " g4 proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second form right and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
only on tuesday , germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the four are leading candidates for permanent seats .
their proposal calls for expanding security council from the current 15 members to 25 . the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on . the revamp of un institutions would need the support of 128 un member countries , but the opposition of one of the permanent five security council members could veto the proposal .
if washington is opposed to berlin 's bid , the entire reform could be shelved .
china has already expressed concern over making japan a permanent member . berlin stays upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york despite the memo detailing rice 's reservations , german officials remained upbeat that washington had not yet decided to torpedo germany 's un aspirations .
wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , told the washington post that the united states has not taken an official position .
he added that the latest proposal would actually address rice 's concerns about overall european representation on the security council . " the bottom line is that our proposal would not increase , but decrease , the relative weight of europe , " ischinger said .
" i think that is a very , very strong argument . " german government spokesman thomas steg also focused on the preliminary nature of the debate over un reform on wednesday .
he said berlin was optimistic there would eventually be broad support for the g4 proposal . " the process of discussion has just started and will pick up pace as it continues in new york , " steg said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts un reform resolution germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2005 german drug deaths drop to 15-year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fears gateway drugs will lead to more dangerous addictions the number of deaths from the use of illegal drugs in germany has fallen to the lowest level in 15 years despite a growing number of youths trying cannabis and amphetamines in 2004 , according to a government report . berlin 's official annual report unveiled on wednesday painted a mixed picture of drug use in germany .
a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . " it raised the question of just how far the state will interfere with people 's right to make their own decisions , " nickel told german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans and their vices the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .

" -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .

the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on . the revamp of un institutions would need the support of 128 un member countries , but the opposition of one of the permanent five security council members could veto the proposal .

and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .
they launched a campaign codenamed ' schoolyard ' in which they were planning to distribute 50,000 cds containing inflammatory neo-nazi music to schoolchildren .
thanks to vigilant citizens , the authorities were alerted and were able to foil their plans .

both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .
yet government efforts , including new anti-terror laws introduced in 2002 , he said , had proved successful in 2004 . " we were able to improve substantially surveillance and intelligence-gathering , " he said , " which is a precondition for curbing islamic terrorism .
the establishment of a national counter-terrorism centre last year has accelerated the processing and analyzing of important information , enabling us to reach a new level in the fight against terrorism . " in 2004 , the report says , german authorities were able to ban two fundamentalist organizations operating here .
among them was the so-called al-aqsa association , which had been collecting money to finance terrorist activities , and a turkish newspaper spreading anti-jewish propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further successes , schily said , were 171 cases brought against terror suspects in german courts .
they included the trial of three iraqi citizens who were allegedly plotting to kill the former iraqi prime minister iyad allawi -lrb- pictured , center -rrb- during a visit to germany last year . new concerns but the report also revealed that 2004 had seen the emergence of new worries , primarily regarding right-wing violence and extremism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right crimes jumped by 10 percent to 12051 incidents .
and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .

but berlin remains confident it will eventually garner washington 's support . according to the washington post 's wednesday edition , rice expressed her opposition while meeting with members of a congressional task force considering reform of the united nations .
the newspaper quoted from a confidential memorandum of a may 5 meeting between rice , former house speaker newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george j. mitchell . " -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .
" in many respects , europe already had a common foreign policy , and that needed to be taken into account in the security council . " g4 proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second form right and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
only on tuesday , germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the four are leading candidates for permanent seats .
their proposal calls for expanding security council from the current 15 members to 25 . the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on . the revamp of un institutions would need the support of 128 un member countries , but the opposition of one of the permanent five security council members could veto the proposal .
if washington is opposed to berlin 's bid , the entire reform could be shelved .
china has already expressed concern over making japan a permanent member . berlin stays upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york despite the memo detailing rice 's reservations , german officials remained upbeat that washington had not yet decided to torpedo germany 's un aspirations .
wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , told the washington post that the united states has not taken an official position .
he added that the latest proposal would actually address rice 's concerns about overall european representation on the security council . " the bottom line is that our proposal would not increase , but decrease , the relative weight of europe , " ischinger said .
" i think that is a very , very strong argument . " german government spokesman thomas steg also focused on the preliminary nature of the debate over un reform on wednesday .
he said berlin was optimistic there would eventually be broad support for the g4 proposal . " the process of discussion has just started and will pick up pace as it continues in new york , " steg said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts un reform resolution germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .
künast published a list of about 200 cigarette additives on the internet wednesday and wants those deemed carcinogenic or addictive banned - throughout europe . " if they cause cancer , they have to go , " she told berliner morgenpost daily on tuesday . the list - over 1,100 pages - includes such seemingly neutral items such as cocoa or honey , harmless by themselves but combined with other additives in cigarettes potentially cancerous .

künast also said that certain ingredients , such as honey , attracted younger people to cigarettes more effectively . a leading german researcher in addiction said he welcomed the plan but warned that it is not a panacea in the war against smoking . " the number of smokers has to be reduced , " rolf hüllinghorst told berliner morgenpost .

the newspaper quoted from a confidential memorandum of a may 5 meeting between rice , former house speaker newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george j. mitchell . " -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.05.2005 britain , blair , brown and europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair in the backseat ?
tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .
what might do it , however , is a " yes " to the eu constitution , but the chances of that actually happening look nothing if not remote . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair critics muted british prime minister tony blair received a standing ovation and broad support wednesday from his labour party for his election victory as critics demanding his resignation were silenced , party members said .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .
künast published a list of about 200 cigarette additives on the internet wednesday and wants those deemed carcinogenic or addictive banned - throughout europe . " if they cause cancer , they have to go , " she told berliner morgenpost daily on tuesday . the list - over 1,100 pages - includes such seemingly neutral items such as cocoa or honey , harmless by themselves but combined with other additives in cigarettes potentially cancerous .
subsequently , researchers are set to investigate each ingredient for its harmful effects . in this way , smokers , who number about 17 million in germany , can inform themselves as to what exactly is in cigarettes and what harm they do , officials say . not a solution by itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating the additives health experts have long held that the tobacco industry inserts ingredients to make people more quickly addicted .
künast also said that certain ingredients , such as honey , attracted younger people to cigarettes more effectively . a leading german researcher in addiction said he welcomed the plan but warned that it is not a panacea in the war against smoking . " the number of smokers has to be reduced , " rolf hüllinghorst told berliner morgenpost .
" but we need the government to implement its complete action plan against smoking , created two years ago . " list will only irritiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raise taxes , some say meanwhile , opposition politicians attacked the initiative saying it was n't an effective weapon against cigarettes and that it wo n't terrify smokers , only irritate them . " it is a contradictory approach , " cdu bundestag member helmut heiderich told the berliner morgenpost . he and other members of the bundestag 's committee on consumer affairs want further tax hikes on tobacco , which have proved effective in reducing the number of smokers . at the same time , heiderich 's cdu colleague , karl-heiny florenz , the head of the european parliament 's health committee told bild daily that there should be a total ban on cigarettes : " cigarettes are a dangerous weapon and need to be removed from the marketplace .

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .

"
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .
during the war years , this field was one of the institute 's man research areas . " in 1942 , josef mengele 's former professor othmar von verschuer was made director of the institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in dahlem , berlin .
he and his protégé went on to work together on the two eugenics projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mengele sent blood samples from some 200 patients of various race to his partner at the berlin institute , while karin magnussen received human parts from the notorious concentration camp , such as eyes taken from a dead sinti family . who else was involved ? it seems likely that these scientists were n't the only researchers receiving nazi support for their studies on heredity and eugenics . " department head wolfgang abel may have also been profiting from deliveries from the concentration camp in auschwitz , " said schuhl , " as well as hans grebe , another one of verschuer 's students , whose work concentrating on hereditary physical deformities .
we do n't know that for sure , but that is our considered opinion . " mengele : monster or middle man ? what role did josef mengele play in the development of this research ?
was he really the " angel of death , " or was he just a gifted scientist taking orders from the third reich 's elite research centers , such as the kaiser wilhelm institute ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's a very controversial question , " explained schmuhl .
" he was n't literally taking orders , because the kaiser wilhelm institute -lrb- photo -rrb- was n't in a position to issue instructions to a camp physician , who was part of the ss hierarchy .
it was basically a network of colleagues , although as mengele 's mentor , verschuer had a certain authority over his former student .
rumor has it that mengele was working on his postdoctoral thesis in auschwitz , which was being supervised by verschuer .
that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .
in that sense , he was taking orders . " perhaps mengele was just the middle man , but he was able to carry out his work thanks to the academic infra-structure of nazi germany , kept well-oiled by fervent believers in the master-race . basic human rights suspended " it 's important to stress that there were never any fixed hierarchies , " said schmuhl .
" instead , there were horizontal networks , which is typical of the science community . people do n't tend to work alone , they work together - drawing colleagues ' attention to interesting cases , providing samples and son on .
it always works like that , and that 's how it worked in the third reich . " the difference was that nazi death camps meant scientists were able to conduct experiments that could never have taken place before . " it was war-time , " pointed out schmuhl .
" there were prisoner of war camps and extermination camps , where basic human rights had been suspended .
it would be easy to accuse the scientists in dahlem of failing to think about the morality of their actions .
they accepted human samples without bothering to ask who had to die first . " many of the scientists incriminated in these cases were never even prosecuted in the post-war years .
after disappearing in 1945 , josef mengele allegedly drowned in brazil in 1979 .
karin magnussen was simply deemed a nazi " fellow traveler , " and spent twenty years as a biology teacher in bremen before dying in 1997 at the age of 89 . most spurious of all was the fate of othmar von verschuer .
he remained a respected scientist in germany and became dean of the university of münster , as well as an honorary member of numerous scientific societies . vivi papanayotou -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mengele hometown opens victim memorial the hometown of nazi war criminal josef mengele opened a memorial to his victims tuesday aimed as an indelible reminder of the horrors of german history .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . " it raised the question of just how far the state will interfere with people 's right to make their own decisions , " nickel told german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans and their vices the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .

"
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .
during the war years , this field was one of the institute 's man research areas . " in 1942 , josef mengele 's former professor othmar von verschuer was made director of the institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in dahlem , berlin .
he and his protégé went on to work together on the two eugenics projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mengele sent blood samples from some 200 patients of various race to his partner at the berlin institute , while karin magnussen received human parts from the notorious concentration camp , such as eyes taken from a dead sinti family . who else was involved ? it seems likely that these scientists were n't the only researchers receiving nazi support for their studies on heredity and eugenics . " department head wolfgang abel may have also been profiting from deliveries from the concentration camp in auschwitz , " said schuhl , " as well as hans grebe , another one of verschuer 's students , whose work concentrating on hereditary physical deformities .
we do n't know that for sure , but that is our considered opinion . " mengele : monster or middle man ? what role did josef mengele play in the development of this research ?
was he really the " angel of death , " or was he just a gifted scientist taking orders from the third reich 's elite research centers , such as the kaiser wilhelm institute ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's a very controversial question , " explained schmuhl .
" he was n't literally taking orders , because the kaiser wilhelm institute -lrb- photo -rrb- was n't in a position to issue instructions to a camp physician , who was part of the ss hierarchy .
it was basically a network of colleagues , although as mengele 's mentor , verschuer had a certain authority over his former student .
rumor has it that mengele was working on his postdoctoral thesis in auschwitz , which was being supervised by verschuer .
that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .
in that sense , he was taking orders . " perhaps mengele was just the middle man , but he was able to carry out his work thanks to the academic infra-structure of nazi germany , kept well-oiled by fervent believers in the master-race . basic human rights suspended " it 's important to stress that there were never any fixed hierarchies , " said schmuhl .
" instead , there were horizontal networks , which is typical of the science community . people do n't tend to work alone , they work together - drawing colleagues ' attention to interesting cases , providing samples and son on .
it always works like that , and that 's how it worked in the third reich . " the difference was that nazi death camps meant scientists were able to conduct experiments that could never have taken place before . " it was war-time , " pointed out schmuhl .
" there were prisoner of war camps and extermination camps , where basic human rights had been suspended .
it would be easy to accuse the scientists in dahlem of failing to think about the morality of their actions .
they accepted human samples without bothering to ask who had to die first . " many of the scientists incriminated in these cases were never even prosecuted in the post-war years .
after disappearing in 1945 , josef mengele allegedly drowned in brazil in 1979 .
karin magnussen was simply deemed a nazi " fellow traveler , " and spent twenty years as a biology teacher in bremen before dying in 1997 at the age of 89 . most spurious of all was the fate of othmar von verschuer .
he remained a respected scientist in germany and became dean of the university of münster , as well as an honorary member of numerous scientific societies . vivi papanayotou -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mengele hometown opens victim memorial the hometown of nazi war criminal josef mengele opened a memorial to his victims tuesday aimed as an indelible reminder of the horrors of german history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.05.2005 britain , blair , brown and europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair in the backseat ?
tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .
what might do it , however , is a " yes " to the eu constitution , but the chances of that actually happening look nothing if not remote . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair critics muted british prime minister tony blair received a standing ovation and broad support wednesday from his labour party for his election victory as critics demanding his resignation were silenced , party members said .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "

swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .

although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas nadeem elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the central council of muslims in germany , believes his fellow muslims would have to remain cool if something similar were to happen in germany .
" muslims must be certain that such cases would be prosecuted , " he said .
" what we definitely do n't want are death threats or a new round of incitements - from our side .
if that were to happen , we would only be doing our opponents a favor .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .
what might do it , however , is a " yes " to the eu constitution , but the chances of that actually happening look nothing if not remote . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair critics muted british prime minister tony blair received a standing ovation and broad support wednesday from his labour party for his election victory as critics demanding his resignation were silenced , party members said .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

"
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .
during the war years , this field was one of the institute 's man research areas . " in 1942 , josef mengele 's former professor othmar von verschuer was made director of the institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in dahlem , berlin .
he and his protégé went on to work together on the two eugenics projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mengele sent blood samples from some 200 patients of various race to his partner at the berlin institute , while karin magnussen received human parts from the notorious concentration camp , such as eyes taken from a dead sinti family . who else was involved ? it seems likely that these scientists were n't the only researchers receiving nazi support for their studies on heredity and eugenics . " department head wolfgang abel may have also been profiting from deliveries from the concentration camp in auschwitz , " said schuhl , " as well as hans grebe , another one of verschuer 's students , whose work concentrating on hereditary physical deformities .
we do n't know that for sure , but that is our considered opinion . " mengele : monster or middle man ? what role did josef mengele play in the development of this research ?
was he really the " angel of death , " or was he just a gifted scientist taking orders from the third reich 's elite research centers , such as the kaiser wilhelm institute ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's a very controversial question , " explained schmuhl .
" he was n't literally taking orders , because the kaiser wilhelm institute -lrb- photo -rrb- was n't in a position to issue instructions to a camp physician , who was part of the ss hierarchy .
it was basically a network of colleagues , although as mengele 's mentor , verschuer had a certain authority over his former student .
rumor has it that mengele was working on his postdoctoral thesis in auschwitz , which was being supervised by verschuer .
that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .
in that sense , he was taking orders . " perhaps mengele was just the middle man , but he was able to carry out his work thanks to the academic infra-structure of nazi germany , kept well-oiled by fervent believers in the master-race . basic human rights suspended " it 's important to stress that there were never any fixed hierarchies , " said schmuhl .
" instead , there were horizontal networks , which is typical of the science community . people do n't tend to work alone , they work together - drawing colleagues ' attention to interesting cases , providing samples and son on .
it always works like that , and that 's how it worked in the third reich . " the difference was that nazi death camps meant scientists were able to conduct experiments that could never have taken place before . " it was war-time , " pointed out schmuhl .
" there were prisoner of war camps and extermination camps , where basic human rights had been suspended .
it would be easy to accuse the scientists in dahlem of failing to think about the morality of their actions .
they accepted human samples without bothering to ask who had to die first . " many of the scientists incriminated in these cases were never even prosecuted in the post-war years .
after disappearing in 1945 , josef mengele allegedly drowned in brazil in 1979 .
karin magnussen was simply deemed a nazi " fellow traveler , " and spent twenty years as a biology teacher in bremen before dying in 1997 at the age of 89 . most spurious of all was the fate of othmar von verschuer .

germany will concentrate on reconstruction efforts in indonesia and sri lanka .
rau said the true " problem child " was banda aceh province in indonesia .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .

but berlin remains confident it will eventually garner washington 's support . according to the washington post 's wednesday edition , rice expressed her opposition while meeting with members of a congressional task force considering reform of the united nations .
the newspaper quoted from a confidential memorandum of a may 5 meeting between rice , former house speaker newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george j. mitchell . " -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .
" in many respects , europe already had a common foreign policy , and that needed to be taken into account in the security council . " g4 proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second form right and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
only on tuesday , germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the four are leading candidates for permanent seats .
their proposal calls for expanding security council from the current 15 members to 25 . the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on . the revamp of un institutions would need the support of 128 un member countries , but the opposition of one of the permanent five security council members could veto the proposal .
if washington is opposed to berlin 's bid , the entire reform could be shelved .
china has already expressed concern over making japan a permanent member . berlin stays upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york despite the memo detailing rice 's reservations , german officials remained upbeat that washington had not yet decided to torpedo germany 's un aspirations .
wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , told the washington post that the united states has not taken an official position .
he added that the latest proposal would actually address rice 's concerns about overall european representation on the security council . " the bottom line is that our proposal would not increase , but decrease , the relative weight of europe , " ischinger said .
" i think that is a very , very strong argument . " german government spokesman thomas steg also focused on the preliminary nature of the debate over un reform on wednesday .
he said berlin was optimistic there would eventually be broad support for the g4 proposal . " the process of discussion has just started and will pick up pace as it continues in new york , " steg said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts un reform resolution germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .

german scholars ines geipel and joachim walther in 2001 began compiling an archive of work by oppressed east german writers , silenced by persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wanted to give young people in particular an image of east germany that goes beyond those ghastly nostalgia shows , " said geipel in an interview with german public broadcaster ndr .
edeltraud eckert , radjo monk , heidemarie härtl and peter voss might not be household names , but once their work is published by edition büchergilde within its " silent library " series that might finally change .
tragic fate penned while she was serving time in the women 's hoheneck prison for political activism , eckert 's poetry , collected in a volume entitled " year without spring " is the first to hit the press .
she died after a horrific accident in the prison workroom in 1955 , aged just 25 .
over the next five years , büchergilde will be publishing another 19 unknown writers whose talents were curbed by state socialism and who failed to reach a more sympathetic readership in the west .
" people were oppressed , " said walther in an interview with der spiegel .
" they were n't allowed to write what they wanted .
in many cases , their lives were ruined .
the official canon needs to be reformed to reflect this part of history . "
silenced voices the former east germany was notoriously ruthless with enemies of the state , including cultural subversives .
writers who dared criticize the oppressive regime were given short shrift - barred , at the very least , from their chosen career , sent to jail and often dispatched to labor camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa wolf a host of high-profile authors from behind germany 's iron curtain were luckier , managing to package veiled criticism in work that the east germany dictatorship was willing to tolerate .
while writers including christa wolf , anna seghers , heiner müller and stefan heym found ways of co-existing within a system they saw as flawed , angrier , more outspoken voices were unceremoniously silenced .
unofficial networks overlooked amid a backlash against many of east germany 's leading writers , accused of collaborating with the infamous stasi secret service , the fate of the gdr 's more extreme literary dissidents was largely ignored in the years following the fall of the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " silent library " project was a painstaking undertaking .
geipel and walther scoured diverse sources from stasi archives -lrb- photo -rrb- , the german literature archive and the academy of arts to regional literary magazines published during the communist era .
" we 're both writers ourselves , " geipel told ndr .
" we knew about east germany 's unofficial literary networks and how they worked . "
until now , these writers were not even footnotes in germany 's literary history .

cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm .
a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " künast said .
" that is why i support a ban on advertising which shows smoking as something cool . "
germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgment .
germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman volker nickel said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . dw-world.de minister wants cigarette additives banned italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers .

cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm .
a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " künast said .
" that is why i support a ban on advertising which shows smoking as something cool . "
germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgment .
germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman volker nickel said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . dw-world.de minister wants cigarette additives banned italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

but berlin remains confident it will eventually garner washington 's support . according to the washington post 's wednesday edition , rice expressed her opposition while meeting with members of a congressional task force considering reform of the united nations .
the newspaper quoted from a confidential memorandum of a may 5 meeting between rice , former house speaker newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george j. mitchell . " -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .
" in many respects , europe already had a common foreign policy , and that needed to be taken into account in the security council . " g4 proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second form right and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
only on tuesday , germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the four are leading candidates for permanent seats .
their proposal calls for expanding security council from the current 15 members to 25 . the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on . the revamp of un institutions would need the support of 128 un member countries , but the opposition of one of the permanent five security council members could veto the proposal .
if washington is opposed to berlin 's bid , the entire reform could be shelved .
china has already expressed concern over making japan a permanent member . berlin stays upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york despite the memo detailing rice 's reservations , german officials remained upbeat that washington had not yet decided to torpedo germany 's un aspirations .
wolfgang ischinger , the german ambassador to the united states , told the washington post that the united states has not taken an official position .
he added that the latest proposal would actually address rice 's concerns about overall european representation on the security council . " the bottom line is that our proposal would not increase , but decrease , the relative weight of europe , " ischinger said .
" i think that is a very , very strong argument . " german government spokesman thomas steg also focused on the preliminary nature of the debate over un reform on wednesday .
he said berlin was optimistic there would eventually be broad support for the g4 proposal . " the process of discussion has just started and will pick up pace as it continues in new york , " steg said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts un reform resolution germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .
künast published a list of about 200 cigarette additives on the internet wednesday and wants those deemed carcinogenic or addictive banned - throughout europe . " if they cause cancer , they have to go , " she told berliner morgenpost daily on tuesday . the list - over 1,100 pages - includes such seemingly neutral items such as cocoa or honey , harmless by themselves but combined with other additives in cigarettes potentially cancerous .
subsequently , researchers are set to investigate each ingredient for its harmful effects . in this way , smokers , who number about 17 million in germany , can inform themselves as to what exactly is in cigarettes and what harm they do , officials say . not a solution by itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating the additives health experts have long held that the tobacco industry inserts ingredients to make people more quickly addicted .
künast also said that certain ingredients , such as honey , attracted younger people to cigarettes more effectively . a leading german researcher in addiction said he welcomed the plan but warned that it is not a panacea in the war against smoking . " the number of smokers has to be reduced , " rolf hüllinghorst told berliner morgenpost .
" but we need the government to implement its complete action plan against smoking , created two years ago . " list will only irritiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raise taxes , some say meanwhile , opposition politicians attacked the initiative saying it was n't an effective weapon against cigarettes and that it wo n't terrify smokers , only irritate them . " it is a contradictory approach , " cdu bundestag member helmut heiderich told the berliner morgenpost . he and other members of the bundestag 's committee on consumer affairs want further tax hikes on tobacco , which have proved effective in reducing the number of smokers . at the same time , heiderich 's cdu colleague , karl-heiny florenz , the head of the european parliament 's health committee told bild daily that there should be a total ban on cigarettes : " cigarettes are a dangerous weapon and need to be removed from the marketplace .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .
künast published a list of about 200 cigarette additives on the internet wednesday and wants those deemed carcinogenic or addictive banned - throughout europe . " if they cause cancer , they have to go , " she told berliner morgenpost daily on tuesday . the list - over 1,100 pages - includes such seemingly neutral items such as cocoa or honey , harmless by themselves but combined with other additives in cigarettes potentially cancerous .
subsequently , researchers are set to investigate each ingredient for its harmful effects . in this way , smokers , who number about 17 million in germany , can inform themselves as to what exactly is in cigarettes and what harm they do , officials say . not a solution by itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating the additives health experts have long held that the tobacco industry inserts ingredients to make people more quickly addicted .
künast also said that certain ingredients , such as honey , attracted younger people to cigarettes more effectively . a leading german researcher in addiction said he welcomed the plan but warned that it is not a panacea in the war against smoking . " the number of smokers has to be reduced , " rolf hüllinghorst told berliner morgenpost .
" but we need the government to implement its complete action plan against smoking , created two years ago . " list will only irritiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raise taxes , some say meanwhile , opposition politicians attacked the initiative saying it was n't an effective weapon against cigarettes and that it wo n't terrify smokers , only irritate them . " it is a contradictory approach , " cdu bundestag member helmut heiderich told the berliner morgenpost . he and other members of the bundestag 's committee on consumer affairs want further tax hikes on tobacco , which have proved effective in reducing the number of smokers . at the same time , heiderich 's cdu colleague , karl-heiny florenz , the head of the european parliament 's health committee told bild daily that there should be a total ban on cigarettes : " cigarettes are a dangerous weapon and need to be removed from the marketplace . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .

both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.05.2005 silenced gdr writers finally given a voice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former east germany discredited dissenting writers sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , a new canon of outlawed east german writers is about to be published for the first time . german literature is poised to welcome some 20 prodigal sons and daughters into its fold , under the aegis of a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the east german dictatorship .
german scholars ines geipel and joachim walther in 2001 began compiling an archive of work by oppressed east german writers , silenced by persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wanted to give young people in particular an image of east germany that goes beyond those ghastly nostalgia shows , " said geipel in an interview with german public broadcaster ndr .
edeltraud eckert , radjo monk , heidemarie härtl and peter voss might not be household names , but once their work is published by edition büchergilde within its " silent library " series that might finally change .
tragic fate penned while she was serving time in the women 's hoheneck prison for political activism , eckert 's poetry , collected in a volume entitled " year without spring " is the first to hit the press .
she died after a horrific accident in the prison workroom in 1955 , aged just 25 .
over the next five years , büchergilde will be publishing another 19 unknown writers whose talents were curbed by state socialism and who failed to reach a more sympathetic readership in the west .
" people were oppressed , " said walther in an interview with der spiegel .
" they were n't allowed to write what they wanted .
in many cases , their lives were ruined .
the official canon needs to be reformed to reflect this part of history . "
silenced voices the former east germany was notoriously ruthless with enemies of the state , including cultural subversives .
writers who dared criticize the oppressive regime were given short shrift - barred , at the very least , from their chosen career , sent to jail and often dispatched to labor camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa wolf a host of high-profile authors from behind germany 's iron curtain were luckier , managing to package veiled criticism in work that the east germany dictatorship was willing to tolerate .
while writers including christa wolf , anna seghers , heiner müller and stefan heym found ways of co-existing within a system they saw as flawed , angrier , more outspoken voices were unceremoniously silenced .
unofficial networks overlooked amid a backlash against many of east germany 's leading writers , accused of collaborating with the infamous stasi secret service , the fate of the gdr 's more extreme literary dissidents was largely ignored in the years following the fall of the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " silent library " project was a painstaking undertaking .
geipel and walther scoured diverse sources from stasi archives -lrb- photo -rrb- , the german literature archive and the academy of arts to regional literary magazines published during the communist era .
" we 're both writers ourselves , " geipel told ndr .
" we knew about east germany 's unofficial literary networks and how they worked . "
until now , these writers were not even footnotes in germany 's literary history .
now , albeit belatedly , they might just become bestsellers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german architecture 's second chance a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2005 skeletons in the closet of german science großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele was often dubbed the angel of death enshrined in the hippocratic oath is a commitment to " treading with care in matters of life and death . "
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .
during the war years , this field was one of the institute 's man research areas . " in 1942 , josef mengele 's former professor othmar von verschuer was made director of the institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in dahlem , berlin .
he and his protégé went on to work together on the two eugenics projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mengele sent blood samples from some 200 patients of various race to his partner at the berlin institute , while karin magnussen received human parts from the notorious concentration camp , such as eyes taken from a dead sinti family . who else was involved ? it seems likely that these scientists were n't the only researchers receiving nazi support for their studies on heredity and eugenics . " department head wolfgang abel may have also been profiting from deliveries from the concentration camp in auschwitz , " said schuhl , " as well as hans grebe , another one of verschuer 's students , whose work concentrating on hereditary physical deformities .
we do n't know that for sure , but that is our considered opinion . " mengele : monster or middle man ? what role did josef mengele play in the development of this research ?
was he really the " angel of death , " or was he just a gifted scientist taking orders from the third reich 's elite research centers , such as the kaiser wilhelm institute ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's a very controversial question , " explained schmuhl .
" he was n't literally taking orders , because the kaiser wilhelm institute -lrb- photo -rrb- was n't in a position to issue instructions to a camp physician , who was part of the ss hierarchy .
it was basically a network of colleagues , although as mengele 's mentor , verschuer had a certain authority over his former student .
rumor has it that mengele was working on his postdoctoral thesis in auschwitz , which was being supervised by verschuer .
that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .
in that sense , he was taking orders . " perhaps mengele was just the middle man , but he was able to carry out his work thanks to the academic infra-structure of nazi germany , kept well-oiled by fervent believers in the master-race . basic human rights suspended " it 's important to stress that there were never any fixed hierarchies , " said schmuhl .
" instead , there were horizontal networks , which is typical of the science community . people do n't tend to work alone , they work together - drawing colleagues ' attention to interesting cases , providing samples and son on .
it always works like that , and that 's how it worked in the third reich . " the difference was that nazi death camps meant scientists were able to conduct experiments that could never have taken place before . " it was war-time , " pointed out schmuhl .
" there were prisoner of war camps and extermination camps , where basic human rights had been suspended .
it would be easy to accuse the scientists in dahlem of failing to think about the morality of their actions .
they accepted human samples without bothering to ask who had to die first . " many of the scientists incriminated in these cases were never even prosecuted in the post-war years .
after disappearing in 1945 , josef mengele allegedly drowned in brazil in 1979 .
karin magnussen was simply deemed a nazi " fellow traveler , " and spent twenty years as a biology teacher in bremen before dying in 1997 at the age of 89 . most spurious of all was the fate of othmar von verschuer .
he remained a respected scientist in germany and became dean of the university of münster , as well as an honorary member of numerous scientific societies . vivi papanayotou -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mengele hometown opens victim memorial the hometown of nazi war criminal josef mengele opened a memorial to his victims tuesday aimed as an indelible reminder of the horrors of german history .

but berlin remains confident it will eventually garner washington 's support . according to the washington post 's wednesday edition , rice expressed her opposition while meeting with members of a congressional task force considering reform of the united nations .
the newspaper quoted from a confidential memorandum of a may 5 meeting between rice , former house speaker newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george j. mitchell . " -lrb- rice -rrb- thought that there was a very poor rationale for giving another member of the european union a permanent seat , " the post quoted the memo as saying .
" in many respects , europe already had a common foreign policy , and that needed to be taken into account in the security council . " g4 proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second form right and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
only on tuesday , germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the four are leading candidates for permanent seats .
their proposal calls for expanding security council from the current 15 members to 25 . the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on . the revamp of un institutions would need the support of 128 un member countries , but the opposition of one of the permanent five security council members could veto the proposal .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas nadeem elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the central council of muslims in germany , believes his fellow muslims would have to remain cool if something similar were to happen in germany .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .

" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2005 skeletons in the closet of german science großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele was often dubbed the angel of death enshrined in the hippocratic oath is a commitment to " treading with care in matters of life and death . "
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .
during the war years , this field was one of the institute 's man research areas . " in 1942 , josef mengele 's former professor othmar von verschuer was made director of the institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in dahlem , berlin .
he and his protégé went on to work together on the two eugenics projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mengele sent blood samples from some 200 patients of various race to his partner at the berlin institute , while karin magnussen received human parts from the notorious concentration camp , such as eyes taken from a dead sinti family . who else was involved ? it seems likely that these scientists were n't the only researchers receiving nazi support for their studies on heredity and eugenics . " department head wolfgang abel may have also been profiting from deliveries from the concentration camp in auschwitz , " said schuhl , " as well as hans grebe , another one of verschuer 's students , whose work concentrating on hereditary physical deformities .
we do n't know that for sure , but that is our considered opinion . " mengele : monster or middle man ? what role did josef mengele play in the development of this research ?

tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ? even before the campaign for britain 's general elections got underway , prime minister tony blair made it clear that , come what may , he would not be standing again .
and although he has repeated his intention to serve the full four or five years of his third successive tenure , widespread beliefs argue that he will not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair in basra , iraq much criticized for his handling of the iraq war , the prime minister has come under increasing pressure from party rebels to call it a day .
but blair 's response thus far has been an appeal to his party to look at the bigger picture . " our fourth victory will be under a different leadership , but we have to remain united , " the prime minister told his mps at their first meeting after the may 5 elections .
but his words were not enough to quash dissent among party rebels who are calling for him to stand down at the annual labour party conference in the autumn .
observers , however , suggest he is unlikely to take his final bow before the referendum on the eu constitution , which is planned for next year .
a dead cert although speculation on the timing of blair 's resignation varies , the subject of who the successor will be has opinion unified : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown .
he has more than proved himself as the financial brains behind blair 's labour party , is officially the most popular finance minister in britain 's postwar history and , according to a recent poll , is better liked and trusted than his current boss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is more passionate about economics than europe but economic wizardry is not the same as running a whole country .
alasdair murray , deputy director of the center for european reform think tank , believes gordon brown would have a lot to learn in order to sit comfortably in the suit of an international leader . " brown is more skeptical than blair .
his style is to work with advisors and to then get on and do things himself , which is not the way things work in europe , " murray said .
" while blair evidently enjoys the statesman side of his job , that is something brown would have to learn . " where blair has flair , brown has a brooding intellect which often leads to him being described as cautious .
alasdair murray said that on the issue of europe , one of brown 's watchwords is indeed " caution . " europe not on brown 's radar patrick dunleavy , professor of politics at the london school of economics , sees brown 's approach to europe as muted .
" he seems to be developing a well worked out plan for the premiership succession and certainly wants to start by making a big impression , " dunleavy said .
" there is much talk about what that impression might be , but nothing has been said about any plan for europe . "
he said the consensus is that brown is currently neither pro- nor anti-europe but is simply technocratic .
" theories of a closer union pass him by .
that has been his attitude all along , and there is no sign that it has changed .
europe is simply not on his radar , " dunleavy added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 downing street : a home fit for a premier but it is the very issue of europe which could elevate brown to 10 downing street before the next run to the polls .
next year , britain is scheduled to vote in a referendum on the eu constitution , and there is little evidence to suggest that blair can swing the historically euroskeptic nation behind a " yes " vote .
alasdair murray said where blair will likely fail , brown could succeed .
" brown is the only way to a ' yes . '
he 's more credible because he 's more of a skeptic .
blair is too pro , so brown should lead the campaign , " he said . opinion about the tack brown will take when it comes to campaigning for the referendum is divided .
some analysts believe any deal tony blair might have struck with his current chancellor about his future premiership would require brown to milk his popularity , give the campaign his all , and steer britain towards approving the constitution . if the strategy were to fail , it would be a mortal blow to tony blair , leaving gordon brown to take over but not take the rap because he would only have been the side-kick in the campaign .
if , however the referendum scored a " yes " vote , blair could back out in a final glow of glory . but others say brown will keep a healthy distance from the whole issue of the constitution ballot .
" he will not choose to undermine the referendum , nor will he put himself in the front line .
but it is a short-sighted policy , because if britain votes against the constitution , he will have a lot of clearing up to do , " murray said .
skepticism or just blissful ignorance ? so what is it with britain and europe ?
even without any imminent prospect of london signing up to the single european currency - indeed that prospect could become even more remote with brown as ruler - britain remains at best dispassionate about the idea of the union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british press is not renowned for promoting the eu professor dunleavy says that is partly because there has never been a political culture of fully embracing the alliance , but adds that media coverage of european issues is so lame that a good percentage of brits are simply " dazed and confused " by the eu .
whether gordon brown is the man to instill a sense of euro-enthusiasm into the island is more than questionable .
what might do it , however , is a " yes " to the eu constitution , but the chances of that actually happening look nothing if not remote . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair critics muted british prime minister tony blair received a standing ovation and broad support wednesday from his labour party for his election victory as critics demanding his resignation were silenced , party members said .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .
künast published a list of about 200 cigarette additives on the internet wednesday and wants those deemed carcinogenic or addictive banned - throughout europe . " if they cause cancer , they have to go , " she told berliner morgenpost daily on tuesday . the list - over 1,100 pages - includes such seemingly neutral items such as cocoa or honey , harmless by themselves but combined with other additives in cigarettes potentially cancerous .
subsequently , researchers are set to investigate each ingredient for its harmful effects . in this way , smokers , who number about 17 million in germany , can inform themselves as to what exactly is in cigarettes and what harm they do , officials say . not a solution by itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigating the additives health experts have long held that the tobacco industry inserts ingredients to make people more quickly addicted .
künast also said that certain ingredients , such as honey , attracted younger people to cigarettes more effectively . a leading german researcher in addiction said he welcomed the plan but warned that it is not a panacea in the war against smoking . " the number of smokers has to be reduced , " rolf hüllinghorst told berliner morgenpost .
" but we need the government to implement its complete action plan against smoking , created two years ago .

italy and ireland have banned cigarettes from public places .
most other countries use taxes as a way to discourage smoking .
now german officials have come up with another method to reduce the number of smokers . in the war against cigarette smoking , german consumer affairs minister renate künast has stepped up the offensive .

" eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , launching an emergency procedure allowed under world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules and called for consultations with beijing on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn .
the eu will impose " temporary " and " reasonable " limits on imports of the two sectors if china does not take voluntary action to rein in its booming exports by the end of a 90-day period , mandelson told afp .
china promises its own measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it will take its own action meanwhile , china 's commerce ministry said tuesday it was unaware of plans by the european union to slap quotas on chinese textile exports until the end of 2005 .
" we have not heard about this , " said an official at china 's commerce ministry , declining to comment further . chinese premier wen jiabao last week promised more measures to curb rampant growth in textile exports to the eu .
he said beijing would " take further effective measures to strengthen our guidance and control on textile enterprises , to adopt economic measures to control the rapid growth of some textile products and clothing exports . " exports surged 534 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding the european market the eu 's executive commission launched an investigation into select textile and garment categories from china last month after compiling evidence that exports surged by as much as 534 percent after a 31-year-old global quota system ended in january .
normally , the investigation is supposed to last a maximum of 60 days during which informal consultations are to be held between brussels and beijing to try to find a solution .
but some eu textile producers have been urging the eu to adopt emergency procedures , which would fast-forward the process to a much more serious formal consultation period . but so far , the commission has only pushed for talks . " in view of the seriousness of market disruption in these categories , formal consultations need to begin immediately , " said the commission in a statement .
eu threatens interim sanctions under wto rules , incorporated into china 's accession protocol to the wto , china is expected to use this period of consultation to propose means to manage the surge in its exports . " only if china does not take effective action will the commission propose temporary limits on the growth of chinese exports in the categories concerned in 2005 , " the statement added . however , the rules also allow the eu to impose " interim import growth restrictions " during the consultation period if china fails to rein in exports to the eu within the first 15-days after the formal talks begin . the eu is not the only trade partner of china 's to consider action limiting textile exports .
the united states re-imposed quotas last week on chinese-made cotton knit shirts and blouses , cotton trousers , and cotton and man-made fiber underwear , in order to curb a flood of imports . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu threatens china with wto over textiles while an eu delegation was ending a two-day visit to china , trade commissioner peter mandelson was telling the european parliament that china faced legal action if booming textile exports to the eu were n't reeled in .

"
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .
during the war years , this field was one of the institute 's man research areas . " in 1942 , josef mengele 's former professor othmar von verschuer was made director of the institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in dahlem , berlin .
he and his protégé went on to work together on the two eugenics projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mengele sent blood samples from some 200 patients of various race to his partner at the berlin institute , while karin magnussen received human parts from the notorious concentration camp , such as eyes taken from a dead sinti family . who else was involved ? it seems likely that these scientists were n't the only researchers receiving nazi support for their studies on heredity and eugenics . " department head wolfgang abel may have also been profiting from deliveries from the concentration camp in auschwitz , " said schuhl , " as well as hans grebe , another one of verschuer 's students , whose work concentrating on hereditary physical deformities .
we do n't know that for sure , but that is our considered opinion . " mengele : monster or middle man ? what role did josef mengele play in the development of this research ?
was he really the " angel of death , " or was he just a gifted scientist taking orders from the third reich 's elite research centers , such as the kaiser wilhelm institute ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's a very controversial question , " explained schmuhl .
" he was n't literally taking orders , because the kaiser wilhelm institute -lrb- photo -rrb- was n't in a position to issue instructions to a camp physician , who was part of the ss hierarchy .
it was basically a network of colleagues , although as mengele 's mentor , verschuer had a certain authority over his former student .
rumor has it that mengele was working on his postdoctoral thesis in auschwitz , which was being supervised by verschuer .
that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .
in that sense , he was taking orders . " perhaps mengele was just the middle man , but he was able to carry out his work thanks to the academic infra-structure of nazi germany , kept well-oiled by fervent believers in the master-race . basic human rights suspended " it 's important to stress that there were never any fixed hierarchies , " said schmuhl .
" instead , there were horizontal networks , which is typical of the science community . people do n't tend to work alone , they work together - drawing colleagues ' attention to interesting cases , providing samples and son on .
it always works like that , and that 's how it worked in the third reich . " the difference was that nazi death camps meant scientists were able to conduct experiments that could never have taken place before . " it was war-time , " pointed out schmuhl .
" there were prisoner of war camps and extermination camps , where basic human rights had been suspended .
it would be easy to accuse the scientists in dahlem of failing to think about the morality of their actions .
they accepted human samples without bothering to ask who had to die first . " many of the scientists incriminated in these cases were never even prosecuted in the post-war years .
after disappearing in 1945 , josef mengele allegedly drowned in brazil in 1979 .
karin magnussen was simply deemed a nazi " fellow traveler , " and spent twenty years as a biology teacher in bremen before dying in 1997 at the age of 89 . most spurious of all was the fate of othmar von verschuer .
he remained a respected scientist in germany and became dean of the university of münster , as well as an honorary member of numerous scientific societies . vivi papanayotou -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mengele hometown opens victim memorial the hometown of nazi war criminal josef mengele opened a memorial to his victims tuesday aimed as an indelible reminder of the horrors of german history .

both radical islam and right-wing extremism continue to threaten german society . interior minister otto schily said that german national security remained largely stable in 2004 , with german law enforcement authorities successfully reducing the threat of terrorist activities .
but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .
yet government efforts , including new anti-terror laws introduced in 2002 , he said , had proved successful in 2004 . " we were able to improve substantially surveillance and intelligence-gathering , " he said , " which is a precondition for curbing islamic terrorism .
the establishment of a national counter-terrorism centre last year has accelerated the processing and analyzing of important information , enabling us to reach a new level in the fight against terrorism . " in 2004 , the report says , german authorities were able to ban two fundamentalist organizations operating here .
among them was the so-called al-aqsa association , which had been collecting money to finance terrorist activities , and a turkish newspaper spreading anti-jewish propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further successes , schily said , were 171 cases brought against terror suspects in german courts .
they included the trial of three iraqi citizens who were allegedly plotting to kill the former iraqi prime minister iyad allawi -lrb- pictured , center -rrb- during a visit to germany last year . new concerns but the report also revealed that 2004 had seen the emergence of new worries , primarily regarding right-wing violence and extremism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right crimes jumped by 10 percent to 12051 incidents .
and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .

but in spite of apparent successes , he stressed , there has been a slight increase in rightwing crime in this country , and the fight against neo-nazi violence and rightwing sentiments needs to intensify . schily also praised germany 's new anti-terror laws introduced after the september 11 attacks on the united states , as well as recent legislation aimed at curbing public appearances of far-right parties in germany . threat of fundamentalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , three years after the terror attacks on the us , the fight against islamic terrorism continues to be germany 's prime national security concern . schily said that there was still a potential of 57,000 radical muslims in germany and that the number of members in fundamentalist organizations had actually increased slightly from 30,950 in 2003 to 31,800 last year .
yet government efforts , including new anti-terror laws introduced in 2002 , he said , had proved successful in 2004 . " we were able to improve substantially surveillance and intelligence-gathering , " he said , " which is a precondition for curbing islamic terrorism .
the establishment of a national counter-terrorism centre last year has accelerated the processing and analyzing of important information , enabling us to reach a new level in the fight against terrorism . " in 2004 , the report says , german authorities were able to ban two fundamentalist organizations operating here .
among them was the so-called al-aqsa association , which had been collecting money to finance terrorist activities , and a turkish newspaper spreading anti-jewish propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further successes , schily said , were 171 cases brought against terror suspects in german courts .
they included the trial of three iraqi citizens who were allegedly plotting to kill the former iraqi prime minister iyad allawi -lrb- pictured , center -rrb- during a visit to germany last year . new concerns but the report also revealed that 2004 had seen the emergence of new worries , primarily regarding right-wing violence and extremism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right crimes jumped by 10 percent to 12051 incidents .
and although the overall number of neo-nazis in germany dropped slightly to 40,700 , the far-right national democratic party was able to attract more than 300 new members , increasing its rank-and-file to well over 5000 .
schily warned that the party 's campaigns were increasingly focusing on the most vulnerable members of german society . " the right-wing scene has stepped up efforts to lure children and young adults to their ranks , he said .
" the npd has even started canvassing in and outside schools .
they launched a campaign codenamed ' schoolyard ' in which they were planning to distribute 50,000 cds containing inflammatory neo-nazi music to schoolchildren .
thanks to vigilant citizens , the authorities were alerted and were able to foil their plans . " increased public awareness the german interior minister made an impassioned plea for greater public awareness in the fight against right-wing and anti-foreigner sentiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal changes , schily said , that had , for example , prevented the npd from marching past berlin 's holocaust memorial at the recent anniversary of the end of world war two , were only part of the battle .
what had been really impressive on that day , he said , were the thousands of counter-demonstrators who stopped the neo-nazis from marching in berlin at all . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough times for muslims in europe a report by human-rights watchdogs confirms something many europeans may have noticed on their own : life has gotten harder for muslims in europe since the terror attacks of sept .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .

a total of 1,385 people died after injecting , smoking or sniffing drugs in 2004 compared with 1,477 in 2003 , said marion caspers-merk , the government 's spokeswoman on drug policy . however , caspers-merk said the consumption of cannabis among children was " alarming " with seven percent of 12 to 14-year-olds admitting to having tried the drug at least once .
marijuana and hashish consumption increased in 2004 and the use of party drugs like speed and ecstasy has also continued to climb . she said the use of cannabis and other softer gateway drugs was worrying since they paved the way for addiction and experimentation with more dangerous hard drugs like heroin .
still , caspers-merk said the decreasing number of drug-related deaths showed the government 's policies were working . " we are on the right path , " she said , pointing to successes in cutting the abuse of alcohol and tobacco . cutting consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kids like alcopops .
the consumption of alcopops , the sweet alcoholic drinks aimed at younger consumers , had dropped among the under-18s , partly due to the introduction of a special tax on them in 2004 which pushed up their retail price . " the wallet remains a good way to battle drugs and addiction , " caspers-merk said . deaths from excessive smoking remain far in excess of those from soft and hard drugs , with 300 a day , amounting to around 120,000 a year .
but the 12 to 17 age group was smoking less than several years ago , thanks to a new taxation policy which has pushed the price of a packet of 19 up to between 3.50 and four euros -lrb- $ 4.40 and $ 5.10 . -rrb- cigarette sales in germany fell by 15.8 percent to a total 111.7 billion cigarettes in 2004 , largely as a result of the higher price of tobacco .
the percentage of teenagers who smoked fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 20 percent last year .
" smoking is becoming less cool among minors , " caspers-merk said . banning tobacco ads the german government said on wednesday it will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive .
cigarette manufacturers will still be able to advertise on billboards and during cinema showings after 7:00 pm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary bill is expected to be adopted by the end of july , consumer affairs minister renate künast said after a cabinet meeting .
" this is something we must do , above all else to ensure that young people never take up smoking , " she said . germany had been a long-time opponent of a ban on tobacco advertising and lodged an appeal with the european court of justice in 2003 against the eu directive , but is still waiting for a judgement . germany 's federation of advertisers criticized the decision to press ahead with a ban , saying it would lead to a sharp fall in advertising revenue for media companies .
the federation 's spokesman , volker nickel , said there was concern that the eu was considering a similar ban on advertising alcoholic drinks . " it raised the question of just how far the state will interfere with people 's right to make their own decisions , " nickel told german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans and their vices the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2005 hate-preachers can expect prosecution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do preachers of hatred belong in front of these judges ?
preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas nadeem elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the central council of muslims in germany , believes his fellow muslims would have to remain cool if something similar were to happen in germany .
" muslims must be certain that such cases would be prosecuted , " he said .
" what we definitely do n't want are death threats or a new round of incitements - from our side .
if that were to happen , we would only be doing our opponents a favor .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "
the german penal code stipulates that a public attack against a religious community that then would disturb the general peace could be followed by legal action .
although islam does not enjoy the same legal status as the main christian religions in germany , it does enjoy the same rights - and protection .
" under article four of the german constitution , the practice of islam falls under freedom of religion just like all other religions , " stated amelung .
" technically , islam has the same rights : to be respected and protected as all other religions . "
reactions from muslim organizations the murder of van gogh and the calls for killing sögaard in sweden make it clear that insults towards religions cut deeply - and emotionally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas nadeem elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the central council of muslims in germany , believes his fellow muslims would have to remain cool if something similar were to happen in germany .

preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ? if germans were polled as to whom they would think of when the term " preacher of hate " were mentioned , then you most likely would hear the name metin kaplan , ' the caliph of cologne . '
his 20 years of asylum in germany were filled with constant frays with the interior ministry .
the most well-known was his call for the death of a rival for which he was finally indicted in germany .
in october , german authorities deported him to turkey where he is being tried for treason .
yet christian clergy are by no means exempt from such unloving behavior .
a case of a preacher insulting the islam prophet mohammed in sweden in march has shown that christian leaders have no qualms about attacking the muslim faith .
in a high-profile sermon , the celebrity pentecostal preacher runar sögaard called mohammed " a confused pedophile . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan had long been a thorn in the side of the german interior ministry swedish muslims responded with outrage .
sögaard was placed under police protection after death threats appeared in the internet .
one radical islamist told the swedish newspaper expressen that he would shoot the preacher if he saw him , even if he was under major police protection .
the swedes were reminded of the assassination of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh in november and the ensuing religious violence in the netherlands .
swedish authorities did not press charges against the popular preacher .
but what would happen in germany if a christian preacher would incite the masses with such inflammatory remarks ?
the legal situation in germany is murky .
prosecutors would have a difficult , if not impossible , time in bringing up the charge of " incitement of the masses " because according to legal experts , a speaker must directly insult the believers of a religion .
a verbal attack against a religious prophet would not suffice .
even a charge of slander would not have promising prospects .
" legally , that would be to ' slander an individual ' within a collective , here under the category ' mohammed ' , " said professor of criminal law knut amelung from dresden .
" that does n't fall under the auspices of german law . "
charges of " insulting " possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not an uncommon picture in sweden : an unidentified muslim woman waiting to vote at a polling station in stockholm where german authorities would have a better likelihood of success is under the charge of " insulting of religious confession . "

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .

the possibility of iran being brought before the un security council is increasing as germany , france and britain lose their patience in negotiations over tehran 's nuclear program . the talks are still a week away , but the chances of iran being hauled before the un security council over its suspect nuclear program have never been stronger , diplomats said ahead of a meeting in europe .
when the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany meet the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani , the " only thing we will agree upon is that we disagree " , a european diplomat told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- left -rrb- , german counterpart joschka fischer -lrb- center -rrb- and french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- right -rrb- are supposed to negotiate with iran it is a bleak assessment that iran shares , describing next week 's emergency meeting as a " last chance " to save its long-running talks with the so-called eu-3 .
tehran has said that germany , france and britain were being held hostage to the hardline us position .
the current crisis is centered on iran 's demand to resume some of its sensitive uranium work , in violation of a deal with the europeans in november 2004 .
that accord opened long-term negotiations on iran 's nuclear fuel drive - the focus of fears the country is seeking the bomb - with the eu offering incentives in exchange for " objective guarantees " from iran .
" the objective guarantees are not there , so there is no question of us agreeing to a resumption of any uranium activities , that includes conversion , " said a european diplomat close to the issue .
to convert or not to convert ?
uranium conversion , which iran wants to restart , is a precursor to the process of enriching uranium - which can make the core of a nuclear weapon .
iran insists , however , that its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including uranium enrichment , is merely aimed at generating electricity and is a right for any country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami -lrb- right -rrb- shakes hands with china 's foreign minister li zhaoxing .
iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
will he play hardball with the eu ?
iran has proposed commencing a phased resumption of fuel cycle work , but that has been rejected .
the europeans want iran to dismantle the program altogether - in other words the same kind of deal that britain and the united states reached with libya .
" the iranians have made just one proposal , and the proposal is not acceptable to us , " said the diplomat , who was speaking on condition that he not be named .
that would not mean an end to diplomacy with tehran and before any debate happens at the security council , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog , would review the matter .
it would be from there that the matter would be sent to new york - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
russian and china would most likely hinder such a move , so a warning to iran would be most likely .
who 'll blink first ?
those close to the talks are not sanguine about either side giving in .
one diplomat said that the two sides looked very determined .
" it 's like two cars heading for a collision .
which driver is going to chicken out first ? " he said .

iran has been able to depend on china 's diplomatic support in negotiations over its nuclear program seen as the only chance for the matter to stay out of the security council though is a last-minute iranian compromise .
last week , under international pressure and after a telephone call from un secretary general kofi annan , iran agreed to the four-way meeting and delay its resumption of uranium conversion work .
" the iranians do not want to go the security council , " said one of the eu diplomats .
" they know that they 'll end up in the wrong pipeline , one which could lead to sanctions .

real madrid midfielder beckham , 29 , is one of the most famous footballers in the world with photographers following his every move and newspapers filling columns about his sporting achievements and private life with wife victoria beckham - a former member of the band the spice girls . " beckham would be well advised to perhaps think about distancing his private life from his public one , " kahn told sportbild magazine .
" otherwise the sporting performance dips and the person suffers too . "
german international kahn , 35 , was plastered all over the red-top tabloids in his homeland himself after splitting from his wife but does not have to contend with the amount of media attention afforded to beckham .
since moving to madrid two seasons ago beckham has fought claims that his marriage to victoria was on the rocks after rebecca loos , who acted as beckham 's assistant when he first moved to madrid , alleged she had a sexual relationship with the footballer .
on the pitch beckham has shown indifferent form for real and england since his move to madrid but has vowed to finish his career in the spanish capital . dw-world.de top teams let nerves get to them bundesliga champions bayern munich entertained their fans with an easy 6-3 win over nuremberg .
with the exception of bremen , the remaining top teams showed a large case of nerves .

hamann , 31 , won the last of his 58 caps in june 2004 as germany crashed out of the euro 2004 finals with a 2-1 reverse at the hands of the czech republic .
hamann has yet to play since klinsmann succeeded rudi völler but has the chance to impress in the confederations cup and make a late bid for a spot in the 2006 world cup squad .
bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler is another player to be recalled despite limited action this season for the german champions .
deisler , 25 , last donned the german jersey in october 2004 as germany defeated iran 2-0 in tehran .
deisler is joined by bayern teammates michael ballack , oliver kahn , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger although philipp lahm , on loan at vfb stuttgart , will miss out after sustaining a crucial ligament injury .
klinsmann has also handed a first call-up to schalke 04 striker mike hanke , 21 , as he continues to put the emphasis on youth .

"
during the third reich , science jettisoned these principles in a bid to advance the perfection of the german race . researchers recently stumbled across new information on extensively documented projects co-conducted during the third reich by the infamous dr. josef mengele , the nazi 's auschwitz angel of death , and the prestigious kaiser wilhelm institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best known for his unspeakably horrific medical experiments using twins , mengele 's first project with the kaiser wilhelm institute was an investigation into how specific proteins can help identify racial origin .
the second project , overseen by biologist karin magnusson , was a look at pigmentation in human iris color . thin end of the wedge after spending six years researching the history of the institute , hans-walter schmuhl from the university of bielefeld is convinced that these were not the only instances of collaboration between the institute and auschwitz . " there were most probably further ties , beyond these two research projects , " he said .
" on the strength of my studies , i also believe that samples of people with disabilities were also sent from auschwitz to berlin .
during the war years , this field was one of the institute 's man research areas . " in 1942 , josef mengele 's former professor othmar von verschuer was made director of the institute for anthropology , human heredity and eugenics in dahlem , berlin .
he and his protégé went on to work together on the two eugenics projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mengele sent blood samples from some 200 patients of various race to his partner at the berlin institute , while karin magnussen received human parts from the notorious concentration camp , such as eyes taken from a dead sinti family . who else was involved ? it seems likely that these scientists were n't the only researchers receiving nazi support for their studies on heredity and eugenics . " department head wolfgang abel may have also been profiting from deliveries from the concentration camp in auschwitz , " said schuhl , " as well as hans grebe , another one of verschuer 's students , whose work concentrating on hereditary physical deformities .
we do n't know that for sure , but that is our considered opinion . " mengele : monster or middle man ? what role did josef mengele play in the development of this research ?
was he really the " angel of death , " or was he just a gifted scientist taking orders from the third reich 's elite research centers , such as the kaiser wilhelm institute ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's a very controversial question , " explained schmuhl .
" he was n't literally taking orders , because the kaiser wilhelm institute -lrb- photo -rrb- was n't in a position to issue instructions to a camp physician , who was part of the ss hierarchy .
it was basically a network of colleagues , although as mengele 's mentor , verschuer had a certain authority over his former student .
rumor has it that mengele was working on his postdoctoral thesis in auschwitz , which was being supervised by verschuer .
that would have meant mengele was answerable to verschuer .
in that sense , he was taking orders . " perhaps mengele was just the middle man , but he was able to carry out his work thanks to the academic infra-structure of nazi germany , kept well-oiled by fervent believers in the master-race . basic human rights suspended " it 's important to stress that there were never any fixed hierarchies , " said schmuhl .
" instead , there were horizontal networks , which is typical of the science community . people do n't tend to work alone , they work together - drawing colleagues ' attention to interesting cases , providing samples and son on .
it always works like that , and that 's how it worked in the third reich . " the difference was that nazi death camps meant scientists were able to conduct experiments that could never have taken place before . " it was war-time , " pointed out schmuhl .
" there were prisoner of war camps and extermination camps , where basic human rights had been suspended .
it would be easy to accuse the scientists in dahlem of failing to think about the morality of their actions .
they accepted human samples without bothering to ask who had to die first . " many of the scientists incriminated in these cases were never even prosecuted in the post-war years .
after disappearing in 1945 , josef mengele allegedly drowned in brazil in 1979 .
karin magnussen was simply deemed a nazi " fellow traveler , " and spent twenty years as a biology teacher in bremen before dying in 1997 at the age of 89 . most spurious of all was the fate of othmar von verschuer .

the aim is to save up to 24,000 female lobsters over the next three years to help boost the species ' population .
instead of ending up in the pot , the creatures will be clipped and released back into the water .
it will then be illegal for them to be landed .
the south wales sea fisheries committee is funding the project between swansea and cardigan bay .
neil viles , from neyland , in pembrokeshire , is one fisherman benefiting from the scheme .
he has 700 pots but he believes the number of lobsters he has caught over the years has fallen steadily .
he said : " just about 15 years ago , a good day would be 200 lobsters .
now a good day is about 30 .
we have some days with as little as a dozen . "
many of the lobster he catches have to be thrown back because they 're too young and are undersized .
but as well as catching lobsters too young , the other danger in terms of over fishing is catching a female whose eggs are about to hatch .
to protect his future , mr viles , like other responsible lobster fisherman , cuts a v-shaped notch into either side of a female lobster 's tail and puts it back in the water .
it is the illegal for another fisherman to land the lobster .
but mr viles said he can not afford to v-notch and return every egg-bearing female he finds .
almost a third of his wage comes from catching them .
so to try and help him and other fishermen , the south wales sea fisheries committee - the agency responsible for monitoring the region 's sea fishing industry - will buy female lobsters from the fishermen and re-release them into the sea .
fisheries inspector mark hamblin said : " if we keep on going the way we are , by not doing anything then there will be no lobsters left in a few years ' time .
" by doing this it enhances the stock and we 've got a bylaw which stops people from taking the v-notches from the sea . "

the aim is to save up to 24,000 female lobsters over the next three years to help boost the species ' population .
instead of ending up in the pot , the creatures will be clipped and released back into the water .
it will then be illegal for them to be landed .
the south wales sea fisheries committee is funding the project between swansea and cardigan bay .
neil viles , from neyland , in pembrokeshire , is one fisherman benefiting from the scheme .
he has 700 pots but he believes the number of lobsters he has caught over the years has fallen steadily .
he said : " just about 15 years ago , a good day would be 200 lobsters .
now a good day is about 30 .
we have some days with as little as a dozen . "
neil viles has seen his catch plummet over 15 years many of the lobster he catches have to be thrown back because they 're too young and are undersized .
but as well as catching lobsters too young , the other danger in terms of over fishing is catching a female whose eggs are about to hatch .
to protect his future , mr viles , like other responsible lobster fisherman , cuts a v-shaped notch into either side of a female lobster 's tail and puts it back in the water .
it is the illegal for another fisherman to land the lobster .
but mr viles said he can not afford to v-notch and return every egg-bearing female he finds .
almost a third of his wage comes from catching them .
so to try and help him and other fishermen , the south wales sea fisheries committee - the agency responsible for monitoring the region 's sea fishing industry - will buy female lobsters from the fishermen and re-release them into the sea .

david ervine said he feared that unless the police caught her killers loyalists could take action themselves .
the uvf and the red hand commando have been " investigating " her disappearance .
he said : " the more they think justice is not likely to happen in that respect the more they 're going to , in their own minds , protect their community . "
mr ervine , whose party is close to the uvf , told the bbc 's spotlight programme that would probably mean killing those they suspected of the murder .
" much as that is distasteful , much as people wish it would n't be the case , " the east belfast assembly member added .
lisa , 25 , disappeared after a party at a caravan site in ballyhalbert in county down on 28 february .
her body has never been found .
three men were questioned about the killing but were later released .
the police are looking at the possible involvement of members of the loyalist volunteer force .
her mother , pat , also told the programme , broadcast on tuesday , she would talk to mainstream loyalist paramilitaries if it meant getting her daughter 's body back .
when asked whether she wanted " paramilitary justice " , mrs dorrian said she did not .
she added : " if they can help , i would be really grateful " .
the family is offering a £ 10,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of lisa 's body .
graffiti in the area following her disappearance suggested a link between the case and the lvf .
when she disappeared , lisa , a shop assistant , left her handbag and personal belongings behind her at the caravan park .

in the winter of 1979 word started to spread in pembroke dock that a flying saucer was being built in an old giant aircraft hangar in the town .
those involved were sworn to secrecy .
for three months they worked on the only full-scale millennium falcon , the spaceship from the original star wars trilogy , to be built for the films .
production was gearing up for the empire strikes back - the second instalment in george lucas 's epic space saga .
and much like the feverish build-up to this week 's release of revenge of the sith , the sixth and final movie in the series , fans were desperate for the smallest piece of news of what was to come .
marcon fabrications , a company more usually associated with steel fabrications for the nearby petrochemical and oil industries , had won the contract to build the prop for the film .
one of company 's main selling points was it was based in the eastern hangar of the royal dockyard - a grade ii listed structure that once housed the famous sunderland flying boats based there during world war ii .
govan davies , who owned the dockyard at the time , recalls the secrecy surrounding the project .
" no-body was allowed in and they kept it locked at all times , " he said .
" it was made out of timber on the outside of a steel frame .
there were 30 or 40 men working on it - it was a hell of a big thing . "
bizarrely , those working on the spaceship were told they could only refer to it by the code name " magic roundabout " .
but mr davies said word soon spread .
" friends talk to friends .
but they still did not allow anyone in although i saw it , of course , because i owned the hangar at the time . "
security was finally breached in march 1979 when the pembrokeshire newspaper the western telegraph ran a picture and story under the headline " security blown on flying saucer secret " .
tongue-in-cheek , it linked the spaceship to an apparent spate of ufo sightings in the sky above the county at the time .
according to brian johnson , special effects supervisor on the film , the spaceship could fly - but only a few millimetres off the ground .
" it weighed approaching 23 tonnes and was 70ft in diameter , " he told the official making of the empire strikes back book .
" we fitted compressed air hover pads on the feet to lift the thing up so it could be pushed around without any wheels .
" the whole thing was actually floating on a cushion of air , with about a sixteenth of an inch between the feet and the floor .
" to get the falcon from pembroke it was dismantled and brought on lorries in sections , then put together on the sound stage at elstree . "

managers at the united lincolnshire hospitals nhs trust said the year had been " very challenging " .
they said this was despite the trust receiving an extra £ 5.5m in government health funding which had prevented the deficit rising as high as £ 10m .
the trust blamed the debt on pay awards and on failing to reach the targets of a financial recovery plan .
half of the loan is due to be paid back in the next financial year with the remainder being paid back by 2007 .
if i was the patient who was in receipt of the health care then i would be thinking life is only going to get better for me .
andy leary , hospital director andy leary , director of finance and performance for the trust , said : " the trust has seen a significant increase in activity in terms of patient care which clearly has got a cost associated with it .
" we have implemented a national pay modernisation agenda which also demands transformation and modernisation of the way in which services are delivered to patients .
" clearly you implement the pay award but it takes longer for you to change services around to reflect modern health care and that 's really what 's causing us the difficulties . "
mr leary could not confirm whether the cost-saving changes would lead to ward closures or job cuts .
the unison union , which represents hospital workers , said it was concerned that the debt could force wards to close .
unison also said it may cause problems with staff recruitment and retainment of staff .

a report commissioned by the royal society for the protection of birds says a massive wind farm on the isle of lewis could be " catastrophic " .
richard lindsay , of the university of east london , said the developers had undervalued the quality of the habitat .
lewis wind power ltd said it would not comment until it had read the report .
rspb scotland has submitted a formal objection to the 234-turbine wind farm .
about 5,000 have been lodged in total , opposing the plan . "
the findings of this report provide the final nail in the coffin for the lewis wind power proposal " anne mccall rspb scotland mr lindsay , the university 's head of conservation , said the wind farm on the hebridean island could have a devastating impact on the internationally important peatland site and the environment as a whole .
he claims lewis wind power ltd has also hugely underestimated the area of carbon-rich peatland which could be affected .
an evaluation undertaken by mr lindsay indicates the impact of the proposed wind farm could be up to 30 times greater than that predicted in the company 's own environmental statement for the site .
carbon emissions " we build wind farms in order to reduce carbon emissions , we then build our wind farms on peat , " mr lindsay said .
" yet peatlands represent the one land-based habitat that is a major long-term carbon store .
" by building the wind farm on peat , we release this carbon store as carbon emissions to the atmosphere . "
he also points out that peat contains less solids than milk and that if it is built upon and disrupted , it can lead to catastrophic " bog slides " such as the recent one at a wind farm in co .
galway , ireland .
in that incident , 2km of peat hillside poured down across the landscape for a distance of more than 20km .
in february this year , rspb scotland submitted its formal objection to the lewis wind farm on the grounds of its likely impact on birds and the environment .
commenting on mr lindsay 's findings , the charity 's planning and development manager anne mccall said : " the findings of this report provide the final nail in the coffin for the lewis wind power proposal .
" the rspb strongly supports the need to tackle climate change and recognises that renewable energy developments will play a critical role in doing so .
' sensitive habitat ' " but it makes no sense to allow a development on a site which is highly valued by local people , internationally important for birds and made up of a highly sensitive peatland habitat . "
the developers ' environmental statement acknowledges that the development will result in the loss of at least 20 red-throated divers , 50 merlin and 50 golden eagles due to collision during the 25-year lifetime of the development .
it also says 350 pairs of golden plover and 314 pairs of dunlin will be lost to the population due to displacement .
the western isles council meets next week to consider presentations from local communities and environmental organisations .
