britain currently holds the shared eu presidency . anthony brenton , the british ambassador in moscow , told journalists that energy would be one of the main themes . " russia is a huge and expanding energy exporter and western europe is a large and expanding energy importer , " he said .
but work is needed in " removing glitches in our scope for energy cooperation . " big supplier about half the gas and one-third of the oil used in the 25-country bloc already comes from or via russia .
according to the international energy agency , eu gas demand could rise by 50 percent in the next 15 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue is especially timely in britain , where north sea oil and gas resources are winding down .
next year , for the first time in three decades , the country is expected to become a net importer of gas . putin last week trumpeted rapid economic growth that analysts say has more to do with oil prices of around 65 dollars a barrel than any meaningful reforms .
russia is " among the leaders , " he claimed , noting that oil and gas reserves across russia " are bigger than we think .
these reserves are enough for us and future generations . " he denied monday that moscow wants to use energy sold to western europe as a way to apply political pressure .
the participation of western companies in building a gas pipeline under the baltic and of russian companies ' in distributing gas and electricity in europe " will help to create a very stable system , " he told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the torshok-tjumen gas pipeline in der russian region of yaroslav the geo-politically sensitive gas pipeline is to be built under the baltic sea to ship fuel directly to germany , bypassing much of eastern europe and recent eu members such as poland , where relations with moscow are more tense . however , officials on both sides are going out of their way to stress common points . ambassador brenton played down russia 's recent scuppering of an eu attempt to censure iran over its civilian nuclear activities , saying : " my feeling is that this was no more than a tactical divergence . " both sides " are firmly committed to preventing iran from getting nuclear weapons . " wto , visas and anti-terrorism meanwhile , the eu ambassador to moscow , marc franco , expressed support for russia 's entry into the world trade organization and for a relaxing of eu visa rules for russia . for students , bureaucrats , journalists and others needing to travel because of their occupation , " it will be much easier in the future to get multiple-entry and long-term visas , " he told journalists . another major item on the agenda - and the top item in wednesday 's britain-russia talks - will be cooperation in anti-terrorism policies , diplomats said . although london and moscow are talking up cooperation in this area , the kremlin remains infuriated by its failure to extradite akhmed zakayev , a leading chechen separatist representative given political asylum in britain . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .

the two german armies , once prepared to shoot at each other , had to put mistrust aside and be combined smoothly into one unit . the german army , the bundeswehr , has been marking its 50th anniversary this year with numerous ceremonies . fifteen years ago it swallowed up the east german combat forces , the national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- , when the official reunification of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- took effect .
the two armies had different traditions , different mentalities and different leadership styles .
the nva soldiers would have to go through a more difficult transition than the majority of east germans .
" on october 2nd , the -lrb- east german -rrb- soldiers went into their barracks in nva uniforms and on the next morning they came out in olive green nato colors , " remembered jörg schönbohm , who was at that time the head of the bundeswehr 's eastern command .
" the gdr flag was lowered , the flag of the federal republic raised .
the mood was subdued , marked by waiting , and by mistrust . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one time warsaw pact members .
in 1990 , the nva ceased to exist and became part of the bundeswehr , a nato member in an instant , the size of the bundeswehr increased by 90,000 soldiers .
not everyone in the former warsaw pact member wanted to see the immediate dissolution of the army but the government in bonn , the capital at that time , said there was no chance that two armies would stand side-by-side or that there would even be an nva department within the defense ministry .
east germany left marks on the nva fifty-thousand former east german soldiers decided that they had an opportunity to further their careers in the bundeswehr and signed on for two years .
there would be exceptions as to who could become bundeswehr soldiers .
almost all high-ranking officers were excluded from continuing their work in the military .
bildunterschrift : nva members on maneuver " the sed -lrb- the east germany coimmunist party -rrb- dictatorship has left its mark , " stressed then defense minister gerhard stoltenberg , pointing out that most generals and admirals had been members of the sed .
they would be unable to impart the bundeswehr 's motto of inner leadership and the citizen in uniform .
the highest officers had simply been molded by the sed .
" the command-giving tactic had to be replaced by the assignment-giving tactic . -lrb- ... -rrb-
this was something that most nva officers learned with great effort , " said gunnar digutsch , nva expert from the university of hanover .
not only were commissioned nva officers finding it difficult in the bundeswehr .
already after one year , three-quarters of those who resigned to serve their new army had quit .
the " army of unity " was sold to the public as a success , but it was mostly young recruits who had not yet been indoctrinated into the nva ideology , who mentally accepted unity .
the army as an example of dialogue the nva had to be completely made over .
military barracks were renovated or razed to the ground .
some 1.3 million small arms , ammunition and military machinery were sold , passed along to another country , or simply scrapped .
new units were created ; a mix of west german and east germans found themselves thrown together in companies , battalions and divisions .
recruits from eisenach -lrb- in the east -rrb- met those from koblenz -lrb- in the west -rrb- , and a dialogue was started at the most basic level .
" the bundeswehr was a kind of contact point for young people , " said digutsch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers laying a wreath in memory of all who were killed in wars yet , while young people were exchanging experiences at the bottom , those at the top faced large challenges , most of all the reduction of the army from 600,000 to 370,000 soldiers .
it was part of the peace dividend of reunification .
that meant uprooting soldiers and their families around germany in what were already turbulent times .
by the mid-90 's , the process was completed and many former nva soldiers , due to their long-time military experience , found employment with industrial companies .
future for young easterners fifteen years after the merger of the bundeswehr with the nva , the newest recruits from both halves of the country are less curious about just how much effort it took to remold the army .
of more interest is the fact that , like on the private labor market , soldiers are paid less in the east than in the west .
nevertheless , more and more young men and women from the east are joining the bundeswehr .
" we -lrb- the army -rrb- have a relative high amount of recruits coming from the east .
these ambitious young officers are of course involved in the missions abroad , " said digutsch .
" i am certain that of these young people , a few will make it up into the upper ranks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.10.2005 oktoberfest less boozy this year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was a little bit less of this going on this year in munich while still far away from being a gathering of teetotalers , alcoholic consumption at this year 's oktoberfest fell from last year .
some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink . the beer festival to end all beer festivals was actually a day longer this year than in the past ; it ran until monday 's unity day holiday .
but despite the extra time to tipple , less beer was actually guzzled at this year 's boozy bash than in the past . the 172nd oktoberfest still saw a lot of beer flow down a lot of gullets .
some 6.1 million people descended on the tents set up in the bavarian capital munich to engage in an orgy of beer drinking , pretzel-munching and bratwurst-noshing .
that beat last year 's crowd of 5.9 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down the hatch and while the amount of food consumed also jumped - the number of cows slaughtered rose from 89 to 95 - the amount of the sudsy stuff imbibed fell .
about 6 million liters -lrb- 13 million pints -rrb- of beer were downed , but that is about 100,000 liters below 2004 levels . the unseasonably cool and often wet weather might have dampened the drinking spirit .
others said new regulations that called for the volume of music played - including the famous oom-pah bands - to be lowered before 6 p.m. could have played a role . " when the music volume is lower people tend to drink a bit less but instead eat more , " said gabriele weishäupel , head of the munich tourist office . police are happy about it , reporting a drop in the number of assaults at the festival , down 248 this year compared to 351 last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.10.2005 us airbase in frankfurt prepares to close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to say " auf wiedersehen " it may not have officially closed yet , but the us rhine-main airbase in frankfurt is already devoid of activity , signalling the end of an era that stretched over 60 years and encompassed many historic moments . the rhein-main airbase , which borders frankfurt 's airport , was once the us military 's european hub , but these days it 's a shadow of its former self .
last monday , the last giant transport plane took off from the base for charleston , south carolina , and this past friday , the last passenger plane moved remaining staff to the spangdahlem base in the eifel region , near cologne . the base officially closes on dec .
31 of this year , but closing ceremonies will be held on oct .
10 .
the farewell has been coming in stages , though , with us units being relocated to other bases since 1995 .
us aircraft have not had a permanent home at rhein-main for years .
the huge , noisy c-130 hercules transport planes were moved to the german base at ramstein and the f-16 fighter jets to aviano , italy . bildunterschrift : a usaf c-117 transport plane prepares to take off from the rhine-main air base . " the planes that you 've seen in recent years at the frankfurt airbase were essentially just passing through , " said wolfgang hofmann , spokesman for the us personnel . the rhein-main base was last a point of tactical importance during the us-led attack on iraq , when planes would take off on a daily basis to transport soldiers and equipment to the persian gulf . needs overhaul us and german authorities signed an agreement in 1999 to close rhein-main by the end of 2005 .
the us air force said it was shutting down the base because its infrastructure was in need of a complete overhaul , making it expensive to maintain .
in addition , frankfurt wanted to expand its airport , and needed the adjoining space occupied by the base .
the closure also comes amid a general shift in the stationing of american troops abroad , as the us decreases its presence in traditional strongholds such as germany , in order to create smaller , more flexible forces around the globe . making history past conflicts in which the base played a key role include the vietnam war , the first gulf war , the afghanistan conflict and the conflict in the former yugoslavia .
but it was shortly after world war two that the base became part of aviation history when it was the coordination point for the berlin airlift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western allied and german officials welcome the first arilift plane , an american c-54 , to land on the runway of the new tegel airport in the french sector of the city of berlin , germany , on nov .

the plane , arriving from frankfurt , is bringing twenty thousand pounds of cheese for the blockaded berlin population . .
that operation began in june 1948 , after soviet authorities halted all traffic by land and water to berlin .
hundreds of usaf c-47 's , nicknamed rosinenbomber or " raisin bombers " by the local population , flew food and supplies into west berlin , sustaining residents for an 11-month period , and saving the city from a soviet takeover . generations of gis stationed in europe made their first contact with the continent at the frankfurt base , where huge letters spelling out " gateway to europe " decorate the side of a building .
one of the most famous gis to make the journey was rock legend elvis presley . jazz and hamburgers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley brought rock star glamor to germany during his time as a gi while the " amis " may not have always been loved by the local population , they certainly left their mark on the region .
some germans credit the gis with making the federal state of hesse cool .
after all , they brought jazz , chewing gum and hamburgers to a depressed postwar germany . it 's not without a little wistfulness , then , that frankfurt bids goodbye to the base , says frankfurt mayor petra roth . " the base was part of frankfurt life for 60 years , and that 's reflected in the close ties between the city and the us , " she said .
on the other hand , roth said , relinquishing the base offers " immense opportunities " for the development of frankfurt airport , which plans to build a third terminal on the site , to be completed by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops to head home in us military cuts us defense secretary donald rumsfeld revealed major military cuts across the united states on friday which would be offset by returning troops from german bases and other european deployments .

dw 's baha güngör heaves a big sigh of relief . monday was to have marked the official launch of landmark entry talks with turkey .
but as the day approached , it seemed more and more unlikely that the negotiations would go ahead as scheduled .
chief among the trouble-makers was austria , which insisted that talks with turkey could only begin if accession negotiations were also opened with croatia . but then , contrary to all expectations , a last-ditch deal was reached after two days of tense debate - salvaging , just in the nick of time , the eu 's reputation as a sturdy super-structure able to take the heat . strategic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-awaited start of turkey 's entry talks represents an historic step for the eu , and a key reinforcement of its security interests in a strategic region .
while turkey once guarded europe 's south-eastern border as a member of nato during the cold war era , it now occupies a key position within the middle east conflict belt . the ultimate aim of the talks is , inevitably , turkish accession , but entry is by no means in the bag .
it will be years before the decision is taken whether or not to allow a politically , economically and socially transformed turkey to join the eu as a full member .
for the time being , piling on the pressure is counterproductive - all it will do is fan the flames of anti-eu sentiment within this mainly muslim country . and the turkish population 's reservations about too hasty a move towards the eu are just as understandable as europe 's wariness of turkey .
the country is well aware it still has many obstacles to weather , and it will be years before its vast regional disparities can start to narrow .
it 's a problem europe has experienced itself - and nowhere more painfully than germany , a country that has been trying to breach the gap between east and west for the last 15 years , and paying a heavy cost in the process . eu compatibility but turkey will also have to prove it is eu-compatible when it comes to democracy , human rights , the armenian question and the kurdish conflict - which will include demonstrating belief in european values in its approach to problem-solving . sorting out cyprus is another challenge turkey faces , and will be a key test of its willingness to compromise . turkey will have to adopt 35 chapters of eu law , and that means every single eu member state has 35 veto opportunities , since every chapter has to be unanimously agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik austria 's shenanigans over the last few days are more than likely to be repeated by one country or another , sooner or later . the risk of failure is acute given that every member state will have to ratify turkey 's entry agreement , some of which by referendum . after its speedy intake of eight new eastern european countries last year , which it 's still belly-aching about , the eu now has another set of problems to deal with .

the country already supplies about half of eu gas needs and is the source or route for about a third of the 25-country bloc 's oil supplies . putin assured that " russia is a reliable partner " and that its resurgent power will be a force for good . " russia keeps raising its output of oil and increases its deliveries to the world market , " he said .
" it helps all the world economy , including the european economy , to grow normally and predictably .

this was in response to the government 's refusal to accept an international enquiry into the suppression this may of an uprising in the eastern town of andijan . however , moscow remains a steady ally of the uzbek government and has never backed an international probe . neither was there mention of the corruption and political interference that many experts believe prevent russia from attracting greater foreign investment - and thereby transforming the still relatively small economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 04.10.2005 how two armies became one großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of sudden , german soldiers were saluting just one flag the reunification of germany in 1990 not only meant the unity of political entities .
the two german armies , once prepared to shoot at each other , had to put mistrust aside and be combined smoothly into one unit . the german army , the bundeswehr , has been marking its 50th anniversary this year with numerous ceremonies . fifteen years ago it swallowed up the east german combat forces , the national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- , when the official reunification of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- took effect .
the two armies had different traditions , different mentalities and different leadership styles .
the nva soldiers would have to go through a more difficult transition than the majority of east germans .
" on october 2nd , the -lrb- east german -rrb- soldiers went into their barracks in nva uniforms and on the next morning they came out in olive green nato colors , " remembered jörg schönbohm , who was at that time the head of the bundeswehr 's eastern command .
" the gdr flag was lowered , the flag of the federal republic raised .
the mood was subdued , marked by waiting , and by mistrust . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one time warsaw pact members .
in 1990 , the nva ceased to exist and became part of the bundeswehr , a nato member in an instant , the size of the bundeswehr increased by 90,000 soldiers .
not everyone in the former warsaw pact member wanted to see the immediate dissolution of the army but the government in bonn , the capital at that time , said there was no chance that two armies would stand side-by-side or that there would even be an nva department within the defense ministry .
east germany left marks on the nva fifty-thousand former east german soldiers decided that they had an opportunity to further their careers in the bundeswehr and signed on for two years .
there would be exceptions as to who could become bundeswehr soldiers .
almost all high-ranking officers were excluded from continuing their work in the military .
bildunterschrift : nva members on maneuver " the sed -lrb- the east germany coimmunist party -rrb- dictatorship has left its mark , " stressed then defense minister gerhard stoltenberg , pointing out that most generals and admirals had been members of the sed .
they would be unable to impart the bundeswehr 's motto of inner leadership and the citizen in uniform .
the highest officers had simply been molded by the sed .
" the command-giving tactic had to be replaced by the assignment-giving tactic . -lrb- ... -rrb-
this was something that most nva officers learned with great effort , " said gunnar digutsch , nva expert from the university of hanover .
not only were commissioned nva officers finding it difficult in the bundeswehr .
already after one year , three-quarters of those who resigned to serve their new army had quit .
the " army of unity " was sold to the public as a success , but it was mostly young recruits who had not yet been indoctrinated into the nva ideology , who mentally accepted unity .
the army as an example of dialogue the nva had to be completely made over .
military barracks were renovated or razed to the ground .
some 1.3 million small arms , ammunition and military machinery were sold , passed along to another country , or simply scrapped .
new units were created ; a mix of west german and east germans found themselves thrown together in companies , battalions and divisions .
recruits from eisenach -lrb- in the east -rrb- met those from koblenz -lrb- in the west -rrb- , and a dialogue was started at the most basic level .
" the bundeswehr was a kind of contact point for young people , " said digutsch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers laying a wreath in memory of all who were killed in wars yet , while young people were exchanging experiences at the bottom , those at the top faced large challenges , most of all the reduction of the army from 600,000 to 370,000 soldiers .
it was part of the peace dividend of reunification .
that meant uprooting soldiers and their families around germany in what were already turbulent times .
by the mid-90 's , the process was completed and many former nva soldiers , due to their long-time military experience , found employment with industrial companies .
future for young easterners fifteen years after the merger of the bundeswehr with the nva , the newest recruits from both halves of the country are less curious about just how much effort it took to remold the army .
of more interest is the fact that , like on the private labor market , soldiers are paid less in the east than in the west .
nevertheless , more and more young men and women from the east are joining the bundeswehr .
" we -lrb- the army -rrb- have a relative high amount of recruits coming from the east .
these ambitious young officers are of course involved in the missions abroad , " said digutsch .
" i am certain that of these young people , a few will make it up into the upper ranks . " andreas noll -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
like dozens before them , they received no punishment .
-lrb- nov .
11 , 2004 -rrb- the end of east germany fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war .
-lrb- aug .
23 , 2005 -rrb- east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .
its citizens aged from 35 to 50 were also in the midst of their adult lives back then .
but for the majority , hopes of a better future have been dashed .

" what can i say , naturally i am overwhelmed , " hänsch told afp . hänsch , a physics professor at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-universität , and american scientist john l. hall shared half of the prize for their groundbreaking work on understanding light . their development of laser-based precision spectroscopy opens the way to the next generation of gps navigation and ultra-precise atomic clocks . how light emitted by a candle differs from the beam produced by a laser in a cd player , or how the already stunning accuracy of atomic clocks could be improved , were among questions this year 's laureates had tackled successfully , the nobel academy said . interest beyond scientific community hänsch , 63 , described his research as a " continuous project with many detours , meanders and also of course frustrations " which had led to findings that he knew would cause interest way beyond the scientific community . " it was the sort of discovery that makes headlines quickly , " he said . he said he had believed that his work would win the nobel prize one day . " i just had n't expected it to come this year , " he said . roy j. glauber , an 80-year-old physics professor at harvard university , won the other half of the nobel prize for establishing the basis of quantum optics , which explained the fundamental difference between sources of light such as light bulbs and lasers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as humans have populated the earth , we have been fascinated by optical phenomena and gradually unravelled the nature of light , " the academy said .
" with the aid of light , we can orient ourselves in our daily lives or observe the most distant galaxies of the universe . " glauber 's pioneering work on applying quantum physics to optical phenomena is over four decades old , being first reported in 1963 . the landmark development by hall and hänsch of the so-called optical frequency comb technique is much more recent , dating from the late 1990s , and shed new light on the difference between matter and anti-matter , as well as allowing time to be measured with unsurpassed precision . following einstein 's lead the 2005 prize comes exactly a century after albert einstein 's " annus mirabilis " - the miracle year in which the german-born genius wrote papers that smashed barriers to knowledge about the physical universe and reshaped our perception of it . bildunterschrift : among einstein 's achievements was ground-breaking work on the nature of light , a foundation upon which all three of this year 's nobel winners built their work . light was first described in the mid-19th century as a form of waves .
einstein , in his theory of the so-called photo-electric effect , also identified light as " lumpy " form , made of particles of energy called photons .
he won the 1921 nobel prize for this . the 2005 laureates will receive a gold medal and share a check for 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1.1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- at the formal prize ceremony held , as tradition dictates , on december 10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , alfred nobel . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

2 , 2005 .
" we are all winners : europe ...
turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , where he was joined by his turkish counterpart abdullah gul . gul hailed the accord : " what is important for us is that the prospect of full membership is very clear .
there is no alternative such as a privileged partnership . " the talks had been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called negotiating framework , which sets out their principles and logistics . the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first constitution in may and june . listen and learn eu leaders have said those polls showed they need to listen more to the public .
yet the most recent survey by the union 's own eurobarometer institute shows that 52 percent of people oppose turkey 's candidacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso " europe must learn more about turkey , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso hours after the ceremony took place .
" and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " he said . britain 's tony blair hailed the talks - and said there was plenty of time to overcome all the " understandable " concerns . " it 's a very , very big change for the european union , there 's no doubt about that .
it -lrb- would -rrb- be unnatural if there were n't worries and concerns , " he said in london . croatia talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's foreign affairs and european integration minister kolinda grabar kitarovic , right , shakes hands with luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn prior to talks between the eu and croatia in luxembourg in a double breakthrough , the eu also trumpeted the start of delayed talks with ex-yugoslav state croatia , after zagreb was deemed by un prosecutors to be helping find a key warcrimes suspect . zagreb 's failure to arrest former general ante gotovina had previously blocked the former yugoslav republic 's bid to begin accession talks , which were originally due to start seven months ago . in a report to the european union on monday , the un war crimes tribunal 's chief prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia had " fully cooperated " with the hague-based tribunal in efforts to locate war crimes suspect gotovina and dismantle his support network . no guarantees the eu insists that starting membership negotiations , which are likely to take at least a decade , do not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan acknowledged the road would be long . " the real work has just begun , " he said in parliament .
" the implementation -lrb- of reforms -rrb- in particular will try us and there will be a great struggle to fully implement the harmonization laws - we will pursue our path with the same determination . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- hailed the opening of talks as a way to push forward dialogue between civilizations . " this step has created a feeling of confidence and courage among nations of the islamic world ... to pursue the democratic process ... in order to consolidate regional and international peace , " oic chief ekmeleddin ihsanoglu said . but former french president valery giscard d 'estaing - architect of the bloc 's near-dead constitution - immediately slammed the deal , which he has warned could lead to the end of the eu . " france used to have a grand project : the political union of europe , " he said .
" we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone : that 's what i regret . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink . the beer festival to end all beer festivals was actually a day longer this year than in the past ; it ran until monday 's unity day holiday .
but despite the extra time to tipple , less beer was actually guzzled at this year 's boozy bash than in the past . the 172nd oktoberfest still saw a lot of beer flow down a lot of gullets .
some 6.1 million people descended on the tents set up in the bavarian capital munich to engage in an orgy of beer drinking , pretzel-munching and bratwurst-noshing .
that beat last year 's crowd of 5.9 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down the hatch and while the amount of food consumed also jumped - the number of cows slaughtered rose from 89 to 95 - the amount of the sudsy stuff imbibed fell .
about 6 million liters -lrb- 13 million pints -rrb- of beer were downed , but that is about 100,000 liters below 2004 levels . the unseasonably cool and often wet weather might have dampened the drinking spirit .
others said new regulations that called for the volume of music played - including the famous oom-pah bands - to be lowered before 6 p.m. could have played a role . " when the music volume is lower people tend to drink a bit less but instead eat more , " said gabriele weishäupel , head of the munich tourist office . police are happy about it , reporting a drop in the number of assaults at the festival , down 248 this year compared to 351 last year .

" replacing the outdated facilities with new coal power stations would result in a 13.5 percent cut in their total co2 emissions by 2030 , it said .

" we are all winners : europe ...
turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , where he was joined by his turkish counterpart abdullah gul . gul hailed the accord : " what is important for us is that the prospect of full membership is very clear .
there is no alternative such as a privileged partnership . " the talks had been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called negotiating framework , which sets out their principles and logistics . the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first constitution in may and june . listen and learn eu leaders have said those polls showed they need to listen more to the public .
yet the most recent survey by the union 's own eurobarometer institute shows that 52 percent of people oppose turkey 's candidacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso " europe must learn more about turkey , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso hours after the ceremony took place .

" what can i say , naturally i am overwhelmed , " hänsch told afp . hänsch , a physics professor at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-universität , and american scientist john l. hall shared half of the prize for their groundbreaking work on understanding light . their development of laser-based precision spectroscopy opens the way to the next generation of gps navigation and ultra-precise atomic clocks . how light emitted by a candle differs from the beam produced by a laser in a cd player , or how the already stunning accuracy of atomic clocks could be improved , were among questions this year 's laureates had tackled successfully , the nobel academy said . interest beyond scientific community hänsch , 63 , described his research as a " continuous project with many detours , meanders and also of course frustrations " which had led to findings that he knew would cause interest way beyond the scientific community . " it was the sort of discovery that makes headlines quickly , " he said . he said he had believed that his work would win the nobel prize one day . " i just had n't expected it to come this year , " he said . roy j. glauber , an 80-year-old physics professor at harvard university , won the other half of the nobel prize for establishing the basis of quantum optics , which explained the fundamental difference between sources of light such as light bulbs and lasers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as humans have populated the earth , we have been fascinated by optical phenomena and gradually unravelled the nature of light , " the academy said .
" with the aid of light , we can orient ourselves in our daily lives or observe the most distant galaxies of the universe . " glauber 's pioneering work on applying quantum physics to optical phenomena is over four decades old , being first reported in 1963 . the landmark development by hall and hänsch of the so-called optical frequency comb technique is much more recent , dating from the late 1990s , and shed new light on the difference between matter and anti-matter , as well as allowing time to be measured with unsurpassed precision . following einstein 's lead the 2005 prize comes exactly a century after albert einstein 's " annus mirabilis " - the miracle year in which the german-born genius wrote papers that smashed barriers to knowledge about the physical universe and reshaped our perception of it . bildunterschrift : among einstein 's achievements was ground-breaking work on the nature of light , a foundation upon which all three of this year 's nobel winners built their work . light was first described in the mid-19th century as a form of waves .
einstein , in his theory of the so-called photo-electric effect , also identified light as " lumpy " form , made of particles of energy called photons .
he won the 1921 nobel prize for this . the 2005 laureates will receive a gold medal and share a check for 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1.1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- at the formal prize ceremony held , as tradition dictates , on december 10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , alfred nobel . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

the two german armies , once prepared to shoot at each other , had to put mistrust aside and be combined smoothly into one unit . the german army , the bundeswehr , has been marking its 50th anniversary this year with numerous ceremonies . fifteen years ago it swallowed up the east german combat forces , the national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- , when the official reunification of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- took effect .
the two armies had different traditions , different mentalities and different leadership styles .
the nva soldiers would have to go through a more difficult transition than the majority of east germans .
" on october 2nd , the -lrb- east german -rrb- soldiers went into their barracks in nva uniforms and on the next morning they came out in olive green nato colors , " remembered jörg schönbohm , who was at that time the head of the bundeswehr 's eastern command .
" the gdr flag was lowered , the flag of the federal republic raised .
the mood was subdued , marked by waiting , and by mistrust . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one time warsaw pact members .
in 1990 , the nva ceased to exist and became part of the bundeswehr , a nato member in an instant , the size of the bundeswehr increased by 90,000 soldiers .
not everyone in the former warsaw pact member wanted to see the immediate dissolution of the army but the government in bonn , the capital at that time , said there was no chance that two armies would stand side-by-side or that there would even be an nva department within the defense ministry .
east germany left marks on the nva fifty-thousand former east german soldiers decided that they had an opportunity to further their careers in the bundeswehr and signed on for two years .
there would be exceptions as to who could become bundeswehr soldiers .
almost all high-ranking officers were excluded from continuing their work in the military .
bildunterschrift : nva members on maneuver " the sed -lrb- the east germany coimmunist party -rrb- dictatorship has left its mark , " stressed then defense minister gerhard stoltenberg , pointing out that most generals and admirals had been members of the sed .
they would be unable to impart the bundeswehr 's motto of inner leadership and the citizen in uniform .
the highest officers had simply been molded by the sed .
" the command-giving tactic had to be replaced by the assignment-giving tactic . -lrb- ... -rrb-
this was something that most nva officers learned with great effort , " said gunnar digutsch , nva expert from the university of hanover .
not only were commissioned nva officers finding it difficult in the bundeswehr .
already after one year , three-quarters of those who resigned to serve their new army had quit .
the " army of unity " was sold to the public as a success , but it was mostly young recruits who had not yet been indoctrinated into the nva ideology , who mentally accepted unity .
the army as an example of dialogue the nva had to be completely made over .
military barracks were renovated or razed to the ground .
some 1.3 million small arms , ammunition and military machinery were sold , passed along to another country , or simply scrapped .
new units were created ; a mix of west german and east germans found themselves thrown together in companies , battalions and divisions .
recruits from eisenach -lrb- in the east -rrb- met those from koblenz -lrb- in the west -rrb- , and a dialogue was started at the most basic level .
" the bundeswehr was a kind of contact point for young people , " said digutsch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers laying a wreath in memory of all who were killed in wars yet , while young people were exchanging experiences at the bottom , those at the top faced large challenges , most of all the reduction of the army from 600,000 to 370,000 soldiers .
it was part of the peace dividend of reunification .
that meant uprooting soldiers and their families around germany in what were already turbulent times .
by the mid-90 's , the process was completed and many former nva soldiers , due to their long-time military experience , found employment with industrial companies .
future for young easterners fifteen years after the merger of the bundeswehr with the nva , the newest recruits from both halves of the country are less curious about just how much effort it took to remold the army .
of more interest is the fact that , like on the private labor market , soldiers are paid less in the east than in the west .
nevertheless , more and more young men and women from the east are joining the bundeswehr .
" we -lrb- the army -rrb- have a relative high amount of recruits coming from the east .
these ambitious young officers are of course involved in the missions abroad , " said digutsch .
" i am certain that of these young people , a few will make it up into the upper ranks .

britain currently holds the shared eu presidency . anthony brenton , the british ambassador in moscow , told journalists that energy would be one of the main themes . " russia is a huge and expanding energy exporter and western europe is a large and expanding energy importer , " he said .
but work is needed in " removing glitches in our scope for energy cooperation . " big supplier about half the gas and one-third of the oil used in the 25-country bloc already comes from or via russia .
according to the international energy agency , eu gas demand could rise by 50 percent in the next 15 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue is especially timely in britain , where north sea oil and gas resources are winding down .
next year , for the first time in three decades , the country is expected to become a net importer of gas . putin last week trumpeted rapid economic growth that analysts say has more to do with oil prices of around 65 dollars a barrel than any meaningful reforms .
russia is " among the leaders , " he claimed , noting that oil and gas reserves across russia " are bigger than we think .
these reserves are enough for us and future generations . " he denied monday that moscow wants to use energy sold to western europe as a way to apply political pressure .
the participation of western companies in building a gas pipeline under the baltic and of russian companies ' in distributing gas and electricity in europe " will help to create a very stable system , " he told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the torshok-tjumen gas pipeline in der russian region of yaroslav the geo-politically sensitive gas pipeline is to be built under the baltic sea to ship fuel directly to germany , bypassing much of eastern europe and recent eu members such as poland , where relations with moscow are more tense . however , officials on both sides are going out of their way to stress common points . ambassador brenton played down russia 's recent scuppering of an eu attempt to censure iran over its civilian nuclear activities , saying : " my feeling is that this was no more than a tactical divergence . " both sides " are firmly committed to preventing iran from getting nuclear weapons . " wto , visas and anti-terrorism meanwhile , the eu ambassador to moscow , marc franco , expressed support for russia 's entry into the world trade organization and for a relaxing of eu visa rules for russia . for students , bureaucrats , journalists and others needing to travel because of their occupation , " it will be much easier in the future to get multiple-entry and long-term visas , " he told journalists . another major item on the agenda - and the top item in wednesday 's britain-russia talks - will be cooperation in anti-terrorism policies , diplomats said . although london and moscow are talking up cooperation in this area , the kremlin remains infuriated by its failure to extradite akhmed zakayev , a leading chechen separatist representative given political asylum in britain . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 04.10.2005 how two armies became one großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of sudden , german soldiers were saluting just one flag the reunification of germany in 1990 not only meant the unity of political entities .
the two german armies , once prepared to shoot at each other , had to put mistrust aside and be combined smoothly into one unit . the german army , the bundeswehr , has been marking its 50th anniversary this year with numerous ceremonies . fifteen years ago it swallowed up the east german combat forces , the national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- , when the official reunification of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- took effect .
the two armies had different traditions , different mentalities and different leadership styles .
the nva soldiers would have to go through a more difficult transition than the majority of east germans .
" on october 2nd , the -lrb- east german -rrb- soldiers went into their barracks in nva uniforms and on the next morning they came out in olive green nato colors , " remembered jörg schönbohm , who was at that time the head of the bundeswehr 's eastern command .
" the gdr flag was lowered , the flag of the federal republic raised .
the mood was subdued , marked by waiting , and by mistrust . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one time warsaw pact members .
in 1990 , the nva ceased to exist and became part of the bundeswehr , a nato member in an instant , the size of the bundeswehr increased by 90,000 soldiers .
not everyone in the former warsaw pact member wanted to see the immediate dissolution of the army but the government in bonn , the capital at that time , said there was no chance that two armies would stand side-by-side or that there would even be an nva department within the defense ministry .
east germany left marks on the nva fifty-thousand former east german soldiers decided that they had an opportunity to further their careers in the bundeswehr and signed on for two years .
there would be exceptions as to who could become bundeswehr soldiers .
almost all high-ranking officers were excluded from continuing their work in the military .
bildunterschrift : nva members on maneuver " the sed -lrb- the east germany coimmunist party -rrb- dictatorship has left its mark , " stressed then defense minister gerhard stoltenberg , pointing out that most generals and admirals had been members of the sed .
they would be unable to impart the bundeswehr 's motto of inner leadership and the citizen in uniform .
the highest officers had simply been molded by the sed .
" the command-giving tactic had to be replaced by the assignment-giving tactic . -lrb- ... -rrb-
this was something that most nva officers learned with great effort , " said gunnar digutsch , nva expert from the university of hanover .
not only were commissioned nva officers finding it difficult in the bundeswehr .
already after one year , three-quarters of those who resigned to serve their new army had quit .
the " army of unity " was sold to the public as a success , but it was mostly young recruits who had not yet been indoctrinated into the nva ideology , who mentally accepted unity .
the army as an example of dialogue the nva had to be completely made over .
military barracks were renovated or razed to the ground .
some 1.3 million small arms , ammunition and military machinery were sold , passed along to another country , or simply scrapped .
new units were created ; a mix of west german and east germans found themselves thrown together in companies , battalions and divisions .
recruits from eisenach -lrb- in the east -rrb- met those from koblenz -lrb- in the west -rrb- , and a dialogue was started at the most basic level .
" the bundeswehr was a kind of contact point for young people , " said digutsch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers laying a wreath in memory of all who were killed in wars yet , while young people were exchanging experiences at the bottom , those at the top faced large challenges , most of all the reduction of the army from 600,000 to 370,000 soldiers .
it was part of the peace dividend of reunification .
that meant uprooting soldiers and their families around germany in what were already turbulent times .
by the mid-90 's , the process was completed and many former nva soldiers , due to their long-time military experience , found employment with industrial companies .
future for young easterners fifteen years after the merger of the bundeswehr with the nva , the newest recruits from both halves of the country are less curious about just how much effort it took to remold the army .
of more interest is the fact that , like on the private labor market , soldiers are paid less in the east than in the west .
nevertheless , more and more young men and women from the east are joining the bundeswehr .
" we -lrb- the army -rrb- have a relative high amount of recruits coming from the east .
these ambitious young officers are of course involved in the missions abroad , " said digutsch .
" i am certain that of these young people , a few will make it up into the upper ranks . " andreas noll -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
like dozens before them , they received no punishment .
-lrb- nov .
11 , 2004 -rrb- the end of east germany fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war .
-lrb- aug .
23 , 2005 -rrb- east germans disappointed by reunification east germany in 1989 was in the midst of a peaceful revolution .
its citizens aged from 35 to 50 were also in the midst of their adult lives back then .
but for the majority , hopes of a better future have been dashed .

but work is needed in " removing glitches in our scope for energy cooperation . " big supplier about half the gas and one-third of the oil used in the 25-country bloc already comes from or via russia .
according to the international energy agency , eu gas demand could rise by 50 percent in the next 15 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue is especially timely in britain , where north sea oil and gas resources are winding down .
next year , for the first time in three decades , the country is expected to become a net importer of gas . putin last week trumpeted rapid economic growth that analysts say has more to do with oil prices of around 65 dollars a barrel than any meaningful reforms .
russia is " among the leaders , " he claimed , noting that oil and gas reserves across russia " are bigger than we think .
these reserves are enough for us and future generations . " he denied monday that moscow wants to use energy sold to western europe as a way to apply political pressure .
the participation of western companies in building a gas pipeline under the baltic and of russian companies ' in distributing gas and electricity in europe " will help to create a very stable system , " he told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the torshok-tjumen gas pipeline in der russian region of yaroslav the geo-politically sensitive gas pipeline is to be built under the baltic sea to ship fuel directly to germany , bypassing much of eastern europe and recent eu members such as poland , where relations with moscow are more tense . however , officials on both sides are going out of their way to stress common points . ambassador brenton played down russia 's recent scuppering of an eu attempt to censure iran over its civilian nuclear activities , saying : " my feeling is that this was no more than a tactical divergence . " both sides " are firmly committed to preventing iran from getting nuclear weapons . " wto , visas and anti-terrorism meanwhile , the eu ambassador to moscow , marc franco , expressed support for russia 's entry into the world trade organization and for a relaxing of eu visa rules for russia . for students , bureaucrats , journalists and others needing to travel because of their occupation , " it will be much easier in the future to get multiple-entry and long-term visas , " he told journalists . another major item on the agenda - and the top item in wednesday 's britain-russia talks - will be cooperation in anti-terrorism policies , diplomats said . although london and moscow are talking up cooperation in this area , the kremlin remains infuriated by its failure to extradite akhmed zakayev , a leading chechen separatist representative given political asylum in britain . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .

the wwf study ranked plants across the eu 's 25 member states according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .
carbon dioxide , a byproduct which results from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil , gas and coal , is the primary component of greenhouse gases that trap the sun 's heat and cause the earth 's temperature to rise . german plants among worst offenders germany is home to five of the survey 's ten dirtiest plants - four of which are run by the country 's giant power company rwe .
rwe was labeled as the biggest co2 producer in the european power sector , according to the wwf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe ag utility company headquarters in essen , germany is one of europes ' biggest producers of co2 .
" german power plants are europe 's top ' climate-killers , " ' said wwf expert regine günther . " the summer of 2005 , with the floods , droughts and heat-waves is just a taste of what can happen if co2 emissions are not drastically reduced . energy providers need to stop playing politics and finally start taking protective measures . " the wwf ranking showed that rwe plants in frimmersdorf , weisweiler , neurath and niederraussen ranked second , sixth , seventh and tenth respectively . additionally , a plant in jänschwalde operated by the swedish power company vattenfall ranked fifth . of the dirtiest power plants , 27 out of the 30 are coal-powered facilities . energy sector target of renovation " the power sector is responsible for 37 percent of all man-made co2 , " said imogen zethoven , head of the wwf 's power campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf logo world wildlife fund " coal-fired power stations rank dirtiest , because they use the most co2-intense fuel .
to switch off global warming we have to replace them with cleaner alternatives , such as gas and renewables , " she said , referring to solar , wind and water power . over the next two decades , many of the " dirty thirty " are set to be decommissioned , noted the wwf , calling this a " historic window of opportunity to cut co2 pollution . " replacing the outdated facilities with new coal power stations would result in a 13.5 percent cut in their total co2 emissions by 2030 , it said .
likewise , a shift to gas would slash co2 emissions by 47.8 percent , while replacing them with renewable energy sources would result in a 73.4 percent cut .
europe just part of the equation under the kyoto protocol , industrial countries that have ratified the treaty are required to trim pollution of carbon gases by a deadline of 2012 as compared with a 1990 benchmark .
many scientists still feel however that this effort falls far short of what is needed to avoid a rapid change in climate which could lead to a major global environmental crisis . after all , the un plan does not include the world 's top polluter , the united states , or developing countries such as china and india , where fast economic growth is driving up emissions . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

but they stayed silent about the many east-west divisions . british prime minister tony blair , currently presiding over the rotating eu presidency , underlined after talks with putin " how important today , for our own economic future and our own security , that relationship is . " " we want to take , therefore , that relationship ... to a new and more intensive , strengthened level . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who also attended the meeting with putin , told journalists the " two strategic partners " had discussed russian energy supplies to europe , terrorism , drugs trafficking , as well as iran and the middle east . they also agreed on starting to ease visa rules for certain categories of russians traveling to europe . resurgent russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oil well in northern russia near the barents sea export terminal of varandey russia is rapidly growing in wealth and diplomatic clout thanks to the enormous potential of its gas , coal and oil resources .
the country already supplies about half of eu gas needs and is the source or route for about a third of the 25-country bloc 's oil supplies . putin assured that " russia is a reliable partner " and that its resurgent power will be a force for good . " russia keeps raising its output of oil and increases its deliveries to the world market , " he said .
" it helps all the world economy , including the european economy , to grow normally and predictably . " he denied moscow might use eu dependency on russian fuel as a political lever , stressing that major new developments in the gas and oil industry involved both european and russian players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " rumors of europe losing its energy independence are highly exaggerated , " he said . putin said that russia 's rapidly growing economy " allows us favorable conditions for an independent foreign policy .
of course it 's like that . "
but , he added : " we do not intend to stick our noses in the air . " democracy concerns blair denied that the european union would soften its positions on russian democracy and human rights , particularly in chechnya , saying that such delicate questions were still on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops sit atop an apc while patrolling in grozny , chechnya " for example we discussed the issue of chechnya earlier today , " he said .
" i do n't think the relationship is one of dependence , either on the russian side or the european side .
but what it is is a recognition of a very strong set of mutual interests . " silent treatment however , in the brief remarks to journalists no time was given to the many sour points in eu-russian relations , ranging from russian backing of iran 's nuclear program to the pro-west revolution in ukraine that saw the defeat of a moscow-backed candidate in last winter 's presidential election . on tuesday the eu imposed an arms embargo on the central asian , former soviet republic of uzbekistan .
this was in response to the government 's refusal to accept an international enquiry into the suppression this may of an uprising in the eastern town of andijan . however , moscow remains a steady ally of the uzbek government and has never backed an international probe . neither was there mention of the corruption and political interference that many experts believe prevent russia from attracting greater foreign investment - and thereby transforming the still relatively small economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

2 , 2005 .
" we are all winners : europe ...
turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , where he was joined by his turkish counterpart abdullah gul . gul hailed the accord : " what is important for us is that the prospect of full membership is very clear .
there is no alternative such as a privileged partnership . " the talks had been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called negotiating framework , which sets out their principles and logistics . the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first constitution in may and june . listen and learn eu leaders have said those polls showed they need to listen more to the public .
yet the most recent survey by the union 's own eurobarometer institute shows that 52 percent of people oppose turkey 's candidacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso " europe must learn more about turkey , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso hours after the ceremony took place .
" and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " he said . britain 's tony blair hailed the talks - and said there was plenty of time to overcome all the " understandable " concerns . " it 's a very , very big change for the european union , there 's no doubt about that .
it -lrb- would -rrb- be unnatural if there were n't worries and concerns , " he said in london . croatia talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's foreign affairs and european integration minister kolinda grabar kitarovic , right , shakes hands with luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn prior to talks between the eu and croatia in luxembourg in a double breakthrough , the eu also trumpeted the start of delayed talks with ex-yugoslav state croatia , after zagreb was deemed by un prosecutors to be helping find a key warcrimes suspect . zagreb 's failure to arrest former general ante gotovina had previously blocked the former yugoslav republic 's bid to begin accession talks , which were originally due to start seven months ago . in a report to the european union on monday , the un war crimes tribunal 's chief prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia had " fully cooperated " with the hague-based tribunal in efforts to locate war crimes suspect gotovina and dismantle his support network . no guarantees the eu insists that starting membership negotiations , which are likely to take at least a decade , do not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan acknowledged the road would be long . " the real work has just begun , " he said in parliament .
" the implementation -lrb- of reforms -rrb- in particular will try us and there will be a great struggle to fully implement the harmonization laws - we will pursue our path with the same determination . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- hailed the opening of talks as a way to push forward dialogue between civilizations . " this step has created a feeling of confidence and courage among nations of the islamic world ... to pursue the democratic process ... in order to consolidate regional and international peace , " oic chief ekmeleddin ihsanoglu said . but former french president valery giscard d 'estaing - architect of the bloc 's near-dead constitution - immediately slammed the deal , which he has warned could lead to the end of the eu . " france used to have a grand project : the political union of europe , " he said .
" we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone : that 's what i regret . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .
-lrb- oct .
4 , 2005 -rrb- eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

after the meeting , schröder said turkey had " clear prospects " for eventual entry into the eu .

" we are all winners : europe ...
turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , where he was joined by his turkish counterpart abdullah gul . gul hailed the accord : " what is important for us is that the prospect of full membership is very clear .
there is no alternative such as a privileged partnership . " the talks had been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called negotiating framework , which sets out their principles and logistics . the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first constitution in may and june . listen and learn eu leaders have said those polls showed they need to listen more to the public .
yet the most recent survey by the union 's own eurobarometer institute shows that 52 percent of people oppose turkey 's candidacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso " europe must learn more about turkey , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso hours after the ceremony took place .
" and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " he said . britain 's tony blair hailed the talks - and said there was plenty of time to overcome all the " understandable " concerns . " it 's a very , very big change for the european union , there 's no doubt about that .
it -lrb- would -rrb- be unnatural if there were n't worries and concerns , " he said in london . croatia talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's foreign affairs and european integration minister kolinda grabar kitarovic , right , shakes hands with luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn prior to talks between the eu and croatia in luxembourg in a double breakthrough , the eu also trumpeted the start of delayed talks with ex-yugoslav state croatia , after zagreb was deemed by un prosecutors to be helping find a key warcrimes suspect . zagreb 's failure to arrest former general ante gotovina had previously blocked the former yugoslav republic 's bid to begin accession talks , which were originally due to start seven months ago . in a report to the european union on monday , the un war crimes tribunal 's chief prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia had " fully cooperated " with the hague-based tribunal in efforts to locate war crimes suspect gotovina and dismantle his support network . no guarantees the eu insists that starting membership negotiations , which are likely to take at least a decade , do not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan acknowledged the road would be long . " the real work has just begun , " he said in parliament .
" the implementation -lrb- of reforms -rrb- in particular will try us and there will be a great struggle to fully implement the harmonization laws - we will pursue our path with the same determination . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- hailed the opening of talks as a way to push forward dialogue between civilizations . " this step has created a feeling of confidence and courage among nations of the islamic world ... to pursue the democratic process ... in order to consolidate regional and international peace , " oic chief ekmeleddin ihsanoglu said . but former french president valery giscard d 'estaing - architect of the bloc 's near-dead constitution - immediately slammed the deal , which he has warned could lead to the end of the eu . " france used to have a grand project : the political union of europe , " he said .
" we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone : that 's what i regret .

the wwf study ranked plants across the eu 's 25 member states according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .
carbon dioxide , a byproduct which results from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil , gas and coal , is the primary component of greenhouse gases that trap the sun 's heat and cause the earth 's temperature to rise . german plants among worst offenders germany is home to five of the survey 's ten dirtiest plants - four of which are run by the country 's giant power company rwe .
rwe was labeled as the biggest co2 producer in the european power sector , according to the wwf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe ag utility company headquarters in essen , germany is one of europes ' biggest producers of co2 .
" german power plants are europe 's top ' climate-killers , " ' said wwf expert regine günther . " the summer of 2005 , with the floods , droughts and heat-waves is just a taste of what can happen if co2 emissions are not drastically reduced . energy providers need to stop playing politics and finally start taking protective measures . " the wwf ranking showed that rwe plants in frimmersdorf , weisweiler , neurath and niederraussen ranked second , sixth , seventh and tenth respectively . additionally , a plant in jänschwalde operated by the swedish power company vattenfall ranked fifth . of the dirtiest power plants , 27 out of the 30 are coal-powered facilities . energy sector target of renovation " the power sector is responsible for 37 percent of all man-made co2 , " said imogen zethoven , head of the wwf 's power campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf logo world wildlife fund " coal-fired power stations rank dirtiest , because they use the most co2-intense fuel .
to switch off global warming we have to replace them with cleaner alternatives , such as gas and renewables , " she said , referring to solar , wind and water power . over the next two decades , many of the " dirty thirty " are set to be decommissioned , noted the wwf , calling this a " historic window of opportunity to cut co2 pollution . " replacing the outdated facilities with new coal power stations would result in a 13.5 percent cut in their total co2 emissions by 2030 , it said .
likewise , a shift to gas would slash co2 emissions by 47.8 percent , while replacing them with renewable energy sources would result in a 73.4 percent cut .
europe just part of the equation under the kyoto protocol , industrial countries that have ratified the treaty are required to trim pollution of carbon gases by a deadline of 2012 as compared with a 1990 benchmark .
many scientists still feel however that this effort falls far short of what is needed to avoid a rapid change in climate which could lead to a major global environmental crisis . after all , the un plan does not include the world 's top polluter , the united states , or developing countries such as china and india , where fast economic growth is driving up emissions . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

dw 's baha güngör heaves a big sigh of relief . monday was to have marked the official launch of landmark entry talks with turkey .
but as the day approached , it seemed more and more unlikely that the negotiations would go ahead as scheduled .
chief among the trouble-makers was austria , which insisted that talks with turkey could only begin if accession negotiations were also opened with croatia . but then , contrary to all expectations , a last-ditch deal was reached after two days of tense debate - salvaging , just in the nick of time , the eu 's reputation as a sturdy super-structure able to take the heat . strategic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-awaited start of turkey 's entry talks represents an historic step for the eu , and a key reinforcement of its security interests in a strategic region .
while turkey once guarded europe 's south-eastern border as a member of nato during the cold war era , it now occupies a key position within the middle east conflict belt . the ultimate aim of the talks is , inevitably , turkish accession , but entry is by no means in the bag .
it will be years before the decision is taken whether or not to allow a politically , economically and socially transformed turkey to join the eu as a full member .
for the time being , piling on the pressure is counterproductive - all it will do is fan the flames of anti-eu sentiment within this mainly muslim country . and the turkish population 's reservations about too hasty a move towards the eu are just as understandable as europe 's wariness of turkey .
the country is well aware it still has many obstacles to weather , and it will be years before its vast regional disparities can start to narrow .
it 's a problem europe has experienced itself - and nowhere more painfully than germany , a country that has been trying to breach the gap between east and west for the last 15 years , and paying a heavy cost in the process . eu compatibility but turkey will also have to prove it is eu-compatible when it comes to democracy , human rights , the armenian question and the kurdish conflict - which will include demonstrating belief in european values in its approach to problem-solving . sorting out cyprus is another challenge turkey faces , and will be a key test of its willingness to compromise . turkey will have to adopt 35 chapters of eu law , and that means every single eu member state has 35 veto opportunities , since every chapter has to be unanimously agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik austria 's shenanigans over the last few days are more than likely to be repeated by one country or another , sooner or later . the risk of failure is acute given that every member state will have to ratify turkey 's entry agreement , some of which by referendum . after its speedy intake of eight new eastern european countries last year , which it 's still belly-aching about , the eu now has another set of problems to deal with .
at least it realized in time that it would n't have been fair to vent its frustration on turkey . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey and eu agree on membership talks the european union clinched an 11th-hour accord with turkey monday to clear the way for landmark talks with the vast mainly muslim state to go ahead , after marathon talks overcame austrian objections .

from the former east germany , he also played a key role in the campaign to reconstruct dresden 's landmark frauenkirche , or church of our lady . born in 1943 in sosa , saxony , ludwig güttler says that october 3 , 1990 is a date he 'll never forget . " german unification was one of the most extraordinary and moving times of my life , " he said .
" it was as if a wound that had never stopped hurting finally began to heal . " success in east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig güttler has played a crucial role in the reconstruction effort in fact , güttler had been one of the lucky ones .
during east germany 's communist years , he was solo trumpeter at the händel festival orchestra in halle and the dresden philharmonic before going on to teach at the international music seminar in weimar and the carl maria von weber conservatory in dresden , where he was a professor until 1990 . even so , gaining permission to travel outside the confines of the gdr was a constant battle .
but by the time the berlin wall had fallen in 1989 , ludwig güttler was performing where and when he wanted .
he was recognized as a virtuoso of international stature and acclaimed around the world as a conductor , scholar , concert promoter and sponsor . unlike many others from the gdr , he went from strength to strength over the next 15 years , appearing as a soloist and conductor at major concert venues both at home and abroad . reclaiming an east german landmark not content with his illustrious career , he threw himself into the reconstruction of dresden 's frauenkirche , a project that cost over 100 million euros .
güttler 's appeals and fundraising activities proved invaluable . " nothing is impossible , " he said .
" the reconstruction of the frauenkirche has a crucial social significance - it was an overwhelming task in terms of building , but it also represented so much more than that . " the advantages of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again after dresden was destroyed in the allies ' fire-bombing in 1945 , the frauenkirche remained a ruin for decades .
the ruling communists were uninterested in its renovation , but it became a touchstone to east germany 's grass roots peace movement . then , after the collapse of the iron curtain , a lobby group came together that was committed to seeing the frauenkirche returned to its former glory - a development that would never have come to fruition in the gdr . despite his successful career , ludwig güttler worked tirelessly as its spokesman . " from the very start , i wanted music to remain my main priority , " he said .
" but at some point i put my work as a teacher on hold in order to devote myself to the reconstruction project . " bildunterschrift : güttler participated in charity concerts , such as this one on dec .
23 , 1993 , from the beginning but it was also his musical credentials that made his fundraising so effective .
ludwig güttler played many concerts on behalf of the frauenkirche .
today , he says it was worth it .

" what can i say , naturally i am overwhelmed , " hänsch told afp . hänsch , a physics professor at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-universität , and american scientist john l. hall shared half of the prize for their groundbreaking work on understanding light . their development of laser-based precision spectroscopy opens the way to the next generation of gps navigation and ultra-precise atomic clocks . how light emitted by a candle differs from the beam produced by a laser in a cd player , or how the already stunning accuracy of atomic clocks could be improved , were among questions this year 's laureates had tackled successfully , the nobel academy said . interest beyond scientific community hänsch , 63 , described his research as a " continuous project with many detours , meanders and also of course frustrations " which had led to findings that he knew would cause interest way beyond the scientific community . " it was the sort of discovery that makes headlines quickly , " he said . he said he had believed that his work would win the nobel prize one day . " i just had n't expected it to come this year , " he said . roy j. glauber , an 80-year-old physics professor at harvard university , won the other half of the nobel prize for establishing the basis of quantum optics , which explained the fundamental difference between sources of light such as light bulbs and lasers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as humans have populated the earth , we have been fascinated by optical phenomena and gradually unravelled the nature of light , " the academy said .
" with the aid of light , we can orient ourselves in our daily lives or observe the most distant galaxies of the universe . " glauber 's pioneering work on applying quantum physics to optical phenomena is over four decades old , being first reported in 1963 . the landmark development by hall and hänsch of the so-called optical frequency comb technique is much more recent , dating from the late 1990s , and shed new light on the difference between matter and anti-matter , as well as allowing time to be measured with unsurpassed precision . following einstein 's lead the 2005 prize comes exactly a century after albert einstein 's " annus mirabilis " - the miracle year in which the german-born genius wrote papers that smashed barriers to knowledge about the physical universe and reshaped our perception of it . bildunterschrift : among einstein 's achievements was ground-breaking work on the nature of light , a foundation upon which all three of this year 's nobel winners built their work . light was first described in the mid-19th century as a form of waves .
einstein , in his theory of the so-called photo-electric effect , also identified light as " lumpy " form , made of particles of energy called photons .
he won the 1921 nobel prize for this . the 2005 laureates will receive a gold medal and share a check for 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1.1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- at the formal prize ceremony held , as tradition dictates , on december 10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , alfred nobel . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

2 , 2005 .
" we are all winners : europe ...
turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , where he was joined by his turkish counterpart abdullah gul . gul hailed the accord : " what is important for us is that the prospect of full membership is very clear .
there is no alternative such as a privileged partnership . " the talks had been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called negotiating framework , which sets out their principles and logistics . the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first constitution in may and june . listen and learn eu leaders have said those polls showed they need to listen more to the public .
yet the most recent survey by the union 's own eurobarometer institute shows that 52 percent of people oppose turkey 's candidacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso " europe must learn more about turkey , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso hours after the ceremony took place .
" and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " he said . britain 's tony blair hailed the talks - and said there was plenty of time to overcome all the " understandable " concerns . " it 's a very , very big change for the european union , there 's no doubt about that .
it -lrb- would -rrb- be unnatural if there were n't worries and concerns , " he said in london . croatia talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's foreign affairs and european integration minister kolinda grabar kitarovic , right , shakes hands with luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn prior to talks between the eu and croatia in luxembourg in a double breakthrough , the eu also trumpeted the start of delayed talks with ex-yugoslav state croatia , after zagreb was deemed by un prosecutors to be helping find a key warcrimes suspect . zagreb 's failure to arrest former general ante gotovina had previously blocked the former yugoslav republic 's bid to begin accession talks , which were originally due to start seven months ago . in a report to the european union on monday , the un war crimes tribunal 's chief prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia had " fully cooperated " with the hague-based tribunal in efforts to locate war crimes suspect gotovina and dismantle his support network . no guarantees the eu insists that starting membership negotiations , which are likely to take at least a decade , do not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan acknowledged the road would be long . " the real work has just begun , " he said in parliament .
" the implementation -lrb- of reforms -rrb- in particular will try us and there will be a great struggle to fully implement the harmonization laws - we will pursue our path with the same determination . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- hailed the opening of talks as a way to push forward dialogue between civilizations . " this step has created a feeling of confidence and courage among nations of the islamic world ... to pursue the democratic process ... in order to consolidate regional and international peace , " oic chief ekmeleddin ihsanoglu said . but former french president valery giscard d 'estaing - architect of the bloc 's near-dead constitution - immediately slammed the deal , which he has warned could lead to the end of the eu . " france used to have a grand project : the political union of europe , " he said .

" it helps all the world economy , including the european economy , to grow normally and predictably .

dw 's baha güngör heaves a big sigh of relief . monday was to have marked the official launch of landmark entry talks with turkey .
but as the day approached , it seemed more and more unlikely that the negotiations would go ahead as scheduled .
chief among the trouble-makers was austria , which insisted that talks with turkey could only begin if accession negotiations were also opened with croatia . but then , contrary to all expectations , a last-ditch deal was reached after two days of tense debate - salvaging , just in the nick of time , the eu 's reputation as a sturdy super-structure able to take the heat . strategic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-awaited start of turkey 's entry talks represents an historic step for the eu , and a key reinforcement of its security interests in a strategic region .
while turkey once guarded europe 's south-eastern border as a member of nato during the cold war era , it now occupies a key position within the middle east conflict belt . the ultimate aim of the talks is , inevitably , turkish accession , but entry is by no means in the bag .
it will be years before the decision is taken whether or not to allow a politically , economically and socially transformed turkey to join the eu as a full member .
for the time being , piling on the pressure is counterproductive - all it will do is fan the flames of anti-eu sentiment within this mainly muslim country . and the turkish population 's reservations about too hasty a move towards the eu are just as understandable as europe 's wariness of turkey .
the country is well aware it still has many obstacles to weather , and it will be years before its vast regional disparities can start to narrow .
it 's a problem europe has experienced itself - and nowhere more painfully than germany , a country that has been trying to breach the gap between east and west for the last 15 years , and paying a heavy cost in the process . eu compatibility but turkey will also have to prove it is eu-compatible when it comes to democracy , human rights , the armenian question and the kurdish conflict - which will include demonstrating belief in european values in its approach to problem-solving . sorting out cyprus is another challenge turkey faces , and will be a key test of its willingness to compromise . turkey will have to adopt 35 chapters of eu law , and that means every single eu member state has 35 veto opportunities , since every chapter has to be unanimously agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik austria 's shenanigans over the last few days are more than likely to be repeated by one country or another , sooner or later . the risk of failure is acute given that every member state will have to ratify turkey 's entry agreement , some of which by referendum . after its speedy intake of eight new eastern european countries last year , which it 's still belly-aching about , the eu now has another set of problems to deal with .
at least it realized in time that it would n't have been fair to vent its frustration on turkey . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey and eu agree on membership talks the european union clinched an 11th-hour accord with turkey monday to clear the way for landmark talks with the vast mainly muslim state to go ahead , after marathon talks overcame austrian objections .

" german chancellor gerhard schröder too welcomed the move . " with it the european union has fulfilled a promise that it made to turkey 40 years ago , " the chancellor said . british foreign secretary jack straw , who 's country currently heads holds the rotating eu presidency , too said the agreement was nothing short of historic . " we are all winners : europe , the existing -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik , right , with austrian ambassador to the eu gregor woschnagg the 11th-hour deal followed nerve-wracking marathon negotiations after austria demanded that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join . long road ahead despite the widespread relief in the european union , which is still in turmoil following the crushing blow it received four months ago when french and dutch voters rejected its planned constitution , observers are still playing down monday 's deal , warning that turkey 's eventual membership could take years . fischer said the negotiations " will last a long time , ten , 15 years , perhaps more . " under the terms of the eu offer to ankara , turkey can not hope to join the bloc before 2014 , and there is no absolute guarantee of membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " europe won today .
that is for me the key point , " fischer added . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed the official start of talks with turkey to join the european union , but warned that the country must win over the skeptical european public . " europe must learn more about turkey .
and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " barroso said in a statement released late monday . " hello europe " in turkey the mood was jubiliant on tuesday . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül reiterated past ankara statements that eu entry could bridge gaps between christians and muslims and help to halt islamic militancy . " this is a win-win situation and the world will also win , " gül said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish trader reads a newspaper with a headline that reads : " we stood firm and won " the turkish media was ecstatic tuesday at the outcome of the negotiations with the eu . " hello europe " was the headline splashed on the mass-selling daily hürriyet .
" twice in history , we 've turned back from the gates leading to vienna , " the paper wrote in reference to austria 's fierce resistance to turkey 's eu membership . " now we 're entering europe on the way to peace and cooperation , " the daily wrote , adding that turkey 's 42-year-old dream of finding a place a europe , was finally become reality . another turkish daily , milliyet spoke of " a new europe and a new turkey . "
the paper wrote that it was the first time that europe was sitting down at the same table with an islamic country and called it " a crucially important step " by the eu " to become a global power . " " turkey and the eu merge their destinies , civilizations embrace , " the daily sabah wrote , while vatan praised ankara 's hard bargaining with the headline : " we stood firm , we won . " the blue and red of the eu and turkish flags were the backdrop to most front pages , while a vatan cartoon depicted the gold stars of the eu flag sparkling on the skyline between two minarets . doubts persist over full membership but elsewhere in europe , doubts persisted in conservative quarters about the wisdom of giving a populous muslim-dominated country a formal date to open eu membership talks at a time when opinion polls show that many europeans are against full membership . former french president valery giscard d 'estaing attacked the move , claiming that if successful they would undermine the basic aim of the eu . he told the rtl radio station that " france used to have a grand project - the political union of europe " - but will now " no longer have a message to bear . " he added , " we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone .
that 's what i regret . " in germany , home to the largest turkish immigrant community in europe and where the conservatives led by angela merkel are supportive of austria 's stance to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership , some papers too struck a cautious tone . " with the fixation on full membership there is the risk of the eu being destroyed by over-stretching .
so who is being stubborn here ? " the center-right frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote . the conservative die welt said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel " spoke out loud what numerous europeans think , but are not allowed to say : full eu membership for turkey is nonsense until the fundamental questions of the eu 's purpose , size and finances have been clarified .

" german chancellor gerhard schröder too welcomed the move . " with it the european union has fulfilled a promise that it made to turkey 40 years ago , " the chancellor said . british foreign secretary jack straw , who 's country currently heads holds the rotating eu presidency , too said the agreement was nothing short of historic . " we are all winners : europe , the existing -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik , right , with austrian ambassador to the eu gregor woschnagg the 11th-hour deal followed nerve-wracking marathon negotiations after austria demanded that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join . long road ahead despite the widespread relief in the european union , which is still in turmoil following the crushing blow it received four months ago when french and dutch voters rejected its planned constitution , observers are still playing down monday 's deal , warning that turkey 's eventual membership could take years . fischer said the negotiations " will last a long time , ten , 15 years , perhaps more . " under the terms of the eu offer to ankara , turkey can not hope to join the bloc before 2014 , and there is no absolute guarantee of membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " europe won today .
that is for me the key point , " fischer added . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed the official start of talks with turkey to join the european union , but warned that the country must win over the skeptical european public . " europe must learn more about turkey .
and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " barroso said in a statement released late monday . " hello europe " in turkey the mood was jubiliant on tuesday . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül reiterated past ankara statements that eu entry could bridge gaps between christians and muslims and help to halt islamic militancy . " this is a win-win situation and the world will also win , " gül said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish trader reads a newspaper with a headline that reads : " we stood firm and won " the turkish media was ecstatic tuesday at the outcome of the negotiations with the eu . " hello europe " was the headline splashed on the mass-selling daily hürriyet .
" twice in history , we 've turned back from the gates leading to vienna , " the paper wrote in reference to austria 's fierce resistance to turkey 's eu membership . " now we 're entering europe on the way to peace and cooperation , " the daily wrote , adding that turkey 's 42-year-old dream of finding a place a europe , was finally become reality . another turkish daily , milliyet spoke of " a new europe and a new turkey . "
the paper wrote that it was the first time that europe was sitting down at the same table with an islamic country and called it " a crucially important step " by the eu " to become a global power .

the wwf study ranked plants across the eu 's 25 member states according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .
carbon dioxide , a byproduct which results from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil , gas and coal , is the primary component of greenhouse gases that trap the sun 's heat and cause the earth 's temperature to rise . german plants among worst offenders germany is home to five of the survey 's ten dirtiest plants - four of which are run by the country 's giant power company rwe .

" the summer of 2005 , with the floods , droughts and heat-waves is just a taste of what can happen if co2 emissions are not drastically reduced . energy providers need to stop playing politics and finally start taking protective measures .

" replacing the outdated facilities with new coal power stations would result in a 13.5 percent cut in their total co2 emissions by 2030 , it said .

but it was shortly after world war two that the base became part of aviation history when it was the coordination point for the berlin airlift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western allied and german officials welcome the first arilift plane , an american c-54 , to land on the runway of the new tegel airport in the french sector of the city of berlin , germany , on nov .
9 , 1948 .
the plane , arriving from frankfurt , is bringing twenty thousand pounds of cheese for the blockaded berlin population . .
that operation began in june 1948 , after soviet authorities halted all traffic by land and water to berlin .
hundreds of usaf c-47 's , nicknamed rosinenbomber or " raisin bombers " by the local population , flew food and supplies into west berlin , sustaining residents for an 11-month period , and saving the city from a soviet takeover . generations of gis stationed in europe made their first contact with the continent at the frankfurt base , where huge letters spelling out " gateway to europe " decorate the side of a building .
one of the most famous gis to make the journey was rock legend elvis presley . jazz and hamburgers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley brought rock star glamor to germany during his time as a gi while the " amis " may not have always been loved by the local population , they certainly left their mark on the region .
some germans credit the gis with making the federal state of hesse cool .
after all , they brought jazz , chewing gum and hamburgers to a depressed postwar germany . it 's not without a little wistfulness , then , that frankfurt bids goodbye to the base , says frankfurt mayor petra roth . " the base was part of frankfurt life for 60 years , and that 's reflected in the close ties between the city and the us , " she said .
on the other hand , roth said , relinquishing the base offers " immense opportunities " for the development of frankfurt airport , which plans to build a third terminal on the site , to be completed by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops to head home in us military cuts us defense secretary donald rumsfeld revealed major military cuts across the united states on friday which would be offset by returning troops from german bases and other european deployments .

" what can i say , naturally i am overwhelmed , " hänsch told afp . hänsch , a physics professor at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-universität , and american scientist john l. hall shared half of the prize for their groundbreaking work on understanding light . their development of laser-based precision spectroscopy opens the way to the next generation of gps navigation and ultra-precise atomic clocks . how light emitted by a candle differs from the beam produced by a laser in a cd player , or how the already stunning accuracy of atomic clocks could be improved , were among questions this year 's laureates had tackled successfully , the nobel academy said . interest beyond scientific community hänsch , 63 , described his research as a " continuous project with many detours , meanders and also of course frustrations " which had led to findings that he knew would cause interest way beyond the scientific community . " it was the sort of discovery that makes headlines quickly , " he said . he said he had believed that his work would win the nobel prize one day . " i just had n't expected it to come this year , " he said . roy j. glauber , an 80-year-old physics professor at harvard university , won the other half of the nobel prize for establishing the basis of quantum optics , which explained the fundamental difference between sources of light such as light bulbs and lasers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as humans have populated the earth , we have been fascinated by optical phenomena and gradually unravelled the nature of light , " the academy said .
" with the aid of light , we can orient ourselves in our daily lives or observe the most distant galaxies of the universe . " glauber 's pioneering work on applying quantum physics to optical phenomena is over four decades old , being first reported in 1963 . the landmark development by hall and hänsch of the so-called optical frequency comb technique is much more recent , dating from the late 1990s , and shed new light on the difference between matter and anti-matter , as well as allowing time to be measured with unsurpassed precision . following einstein 's lead the 2005 prize comes exactly a century after albert einstein 's " annus mirabilis " - the miracle year in which the german-born genius wrote papers that smashed barriers to knowledge about the physical universe and reshaped our perception of it . bildunterschrift : among einstein 's achievements was ground-breaking work on the nature of light , a foundation upon which all three of this year 's nobel winners built their work . light was first described in the mid-19th century as a form of waves .
einstein , in his theory of the so-called photo-electric effect , also identified light as " lumpy " form , made of particles of energy called photons .

from the former east germany , he also played a key role in the campaign to reconstruct dresden 's landmark frauenkirche , or church of our lady . born in 1943 in sosa , saxony , ludwig güttler says that october 3 , 1990 is a date he 'll never forget . " german unification was one of the most extraordinary and moving times of my life , " he said .
" it was as if a wound that had never stopped hurting finally began to heal . " success in east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig güttler has played a crucial role in the reconstruction effort in fact , güttler had been one of the lucky ones .
during east germany 's communist years , he was solo trumpeter at the händel festival orchestra in halle and the dresden philharmonic before going on to teach at the international music seminar in weimar and the carl maria von weber conservatory in dresden , where he was a professor until 1990 . even so , gaining permission to travel outside the confines of the gdr was a constant battle .
but by the time the berlin wall had fallen in 1989 , ludwig güttler was performing where and when he wanted .
he was recognized as a virtuoso of international stature and acclaimed around the world as a conductor , scholar , concert promoter and sponsor . unlike many others from the gdr , he went from strength to strength over the next 15 years , appearing as a soloist and conductor at major concert venues both at home and abroad . reclaiming an east german landmark not content with his illustrious career , he threw himself into the reconstruction of dresden 's frauenkirche , a project that cost over 100 million euros .
güttler 's appeals and fundraising activities proved invaluable . " nothing is impossible , " he said .
" the reconstruction of the frauenkirche has a crucial social significance - it was an overwhelming task in terms of building , but it also represented so much more than that . " the advantages of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again after dresden was destroyed in the allies ' fire-bombing in 1945 , the frauenkirche remained a ruin for decades .
the ruling communists were uninterested in its renovation , but it became a touchstone to east germany 's grass roots peace movement . then , after the collapse of the iron curtain , a lobby group came together that was committed to seeing the frauenkirche returned to its former glory - a development that would never have come to fruition in the gdr . despite his successful career , ludwig güttler worked tirelessly as its spokesman . " from the very start , i wanted music to remain my main priority , " he said .
" but at some point i put my work as a teacher on hold in order to devote myself to the reconstruction project . " bildunterschrift : güttler participated in charity concerts , such as this one on dec .
23 , 1993 , from the beginning but it was also his musical credentials that made his fundraising so effective .
ludwig güttler played many concerts on behalf of the frauenkirche .
today , he says it was worth it .

2 , 2005 .
" we are all winners : europe ...
turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , where he was joined by his turkish counterpart abdullah gul . gul hailed the accord : " what is important for us is that the prospect of full membership is very clear .
there is no alternative such as a privileged partnership . " the talks had been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called negotiating framework , which sets out their principles and logistics . the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first constitution in may and june . listen and learn eu leaders have said those polls showed they need to listen more to the public .
yet the most recent survey by the union 's own eurobarometer institute shows that 52 percent of people oppose turkey 's candidacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso " europe must learn more about turkey , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso hours after the ceremony took place .
" and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " he said . britain 's tony blair hailed the talks - and said there was plenty of time to overcome all the " understandable " concerns . " it 's a very , very big change for the european union , there 's no doubt about that .
it -lrb- would -rrb- be unnatural if there were n't worries and concerns , " he said in london . croatia talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's foreign affairs and european integration minister kolinda grabar kitarovic , right , shakes hands with luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn prior to talks between the eu and croatia in luxembourg in a double breakthrough , the eu also trumpeted the start of delayed talks with ex-yugoslav state croatia , after zagreb was deemed by un prosecutors to be helping find a key warcrimes suspect . zagreb 's failure to arrest former general ante gotovina had previously blocked the former yugoslav republic 's bid to begin accession talks , which were originally due to start seven months ago . in a report to the european union on monday , the un war crimes tribunal 's chief prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia had " fully cooperated " with the hague-based tribunal in efforts to locate war crimes suspect gotovina and dismantle his support network . no guarantees the eu insists that starting membership negotiations , which are likely to take at least a decade , do not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan acknowledged the road would be long . " the real work has just begun , " he said in parliament .
" the implementation -lrb- of reforms -rrb- in particular will try us and there will be a great struggle to fully implement the harmonization laws - we will pursue our path with the same determination . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- hailed the opening of talks as a way to push forward dialogue between civilizations . " this step has created a feeling of confidence and courage among nations of the islamic world ... to pursue the democratic process ... in order to consolidate regional and international peace , " oic chief ekmeleddin ihsanoglu said . but former french president valery giscard d 'estaing - architect of the bloc 's near-dead constitution - immediately slammed the deal , which he has warned could lead to the end of the eu . " france used to have a grand project : the political union of europe , " he said .
" we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone : that 's what i regret .

the two german armies , once prepared to shoot at each other , had to put mistrust aside and be combined smoothly into one unit . the german army , the bundeswehr , has been marking its 50th anniversary this year with numerous ceremonies . fifteen years ago it swallowed up the east german combat forces , the national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- , when the official reunification of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- took effect .
the two armies had different traditions , different mentalities and different leadership styles .
the nva soldiers would have to go through a more difficult transition than the majority of east germans .
" on october 2nd , the -lrb- east german -rrb- soldiers went into their barracks in nva uniforms and on the next morning they came out in olive green nato colors , " remembered jörg schönbohm , who was at that time the head of the bundeswehr 's eastern command .
" the gdr flag was lowered , the flag of the federal republic raised .
the mood was subdued , marked by waiting , and by mistrust . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one time warsaw pact members .
in 1990 , the nva ceased to exist and became part of the bundeswehr , a nato member in an instant , the size of the bundeswehr increased by 90,000 soldiers .
not everyone in the former warsaw pact member wanted to see the immediate dissolution of the army but the government in bonn , the capital at that time , said there was no chance that two armies would stand side-by-side or that there would even be an nva department within the defense ministry .
east germany left marks on the nva fifty-thousand former east german soldiers decided that they had an opportunity to further their careers in the bundeswehr and signed on for two years .
there would be exceptions as to who could become bundeswehr soldiers .
almost all high-ranking officers were excluded from continuing their work in the military .
bildunterschrift : nva members on maneuver " the sed -lrb- the east germany coimmunist party -rrb- dictatorship has left its mark , " stressed then defense minister gerhard stoltenberg , pointing out that most generals and admirals had been members of the sed .
they would be unable to impart the bundeswehr 's motto of inner leadership and the citizen in uniform .
the highest officers had simply been molded by the sed .
" the command-giving tactic had to be replaced by the assignment-giving tactic . -lrb- ... -rrb-
this was something that most nva officers learned with great effort , " said gunnar digutsch , nva expert from the university of hanover .
not only were commissioned nva officers finding it difficult in the bundeswehr .
already after one year , three-quarters of those who resigned to serve their new army had quit .
the " army of unity " was sold to the public as a success , but it was mostly young recruits who had not yet been indoctrinated into the nva ideology , who mentally accepted unity .
the army as an example of dialogue the nva had to be completely made over .
military barracks were renovated or razed to the ground .
some 1.3 million small arms , ammunition and military machinery were sold , passed along to another country , or simply scrapped .
new units were created ; a mix of west german and east germans found themselves thrown together in companies , battalions and divisions .
recruits from eisenach -lrb- in the east -rrb- met those from koblenz -lrb- in the west -rrb- , and a dialogue was started at the most basic level .
" the bundeswehr was a kind of contact point for young people , " said digutsch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers laying a wreath in memory of all who were killed in wars yet , while young people were exchanging experiences at the bottom , those at the top faced large challenges , most of all the reduction of the army from 600,000 to 370,000 soldiers .
it was part of the peace dividend of reunification .
that meant uprooting soldiers and their families around germany in what were already turbulent times .
by the mid-90 's , the process was completed and many former nva soldiers , due to their long-time military experience , found employment with industrial companies .
future for young easterners fifteen years after the merger of the bundeswehr with the nva , the newest recruits from both halves of the country are less curious about just how much effort it took to remold the army .
of more interest is the fact that , like on the private labor market , soldiers are paid less in the east than in the west .
nevertheless , more and more young men and women from the east are joining the bundeswehr .
" we -lrb- the army -rrb- have a relative high amount of recruits coming from the east .
these ambitious young officers are of course involved in the missions abroad , " said digutsch .
" i am certain that of these young people , a few will make it up into the upper ranks .

the two german armies , once prepared to shoot at each other , had to put mistrust aside and be combined smoothly into one unit . the german army , the bundeswehr , has been marking its 50th anniversary this year with numerous ceremonies . fifteen years ago it swallowed up the east german combat forces , the national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- , when the official reunification of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- took effect .
the two armies had different traditions , different mentalities and different leadership styles .
the nva soldiers would have to go through a more difficult transition than the majority of east germans .
" on october 2nd , the -lrb- east german -rrb- soldiers went into their barracks in nva uniforms and on the next morning they came out in olive green nato colors , " remembered jörg schönbohm , who was at that time the head of the bundeswehr 's eastern command .
" the gdr flag was lowered , the flag of the federal republic raised .
the mood was subdued , marked by waiting , and by mistrust . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one time warsaw pact members .
in 1990 , the nva ceased to exist and became part of the bundeswehr , a nato member in an instant , the size of the bundeswehr increased by 90,000 soldiers .
not everyone in the former warsaw pact member wanted to see the immediate dissolution of the army but the government in bonn , the capital at that time , said there was no chance that two armies would stand side-by-side or that there would even be an nva department within the defense ministry .
east germany left marks on the nva fifty-thousand former east german soldiers decided that they had an opportunity to further their careers in the bundeswehr and signed on for two years .
there would be exceptions as to who could become bundeswehr soldiers .
almost all high-ranking officers were excluded from continuing their work in the military .
bildunterschrift : nva members on maneuver " the sed -lrb- the east germany coimmunist party -rrb- dictatorship has left its mark , " stressed then defense minister gerhard stoltenberg , pointing out that most generals and admirals had been members of the sed .
they would be unable to impart the bundeswehr 's motto of inner leadership and the citizen in uniform .
the highest officers had simply been molded by the sed .
" the command-giving tactic had to be replaced by the assignment-giving tactic . -lrb- ... -rrb-
this was something that most nva officers learned with great effort , " said gunnar digutsch , nva expert from the university of hanover .
not only were commissioned nva officers finding it difficult in the bundeswehr .
already after one year , three-quarters of those who resigned to serve their new army had quit .
the " army of unity " was sold to the public as a success , but it was mostly young recruits who had not yet been indoctrinated into the nva ideology , who mentally accepted unity .
the army as an example of dialogue the nva had to be completely made over .
military barracks were renovated or razed to the ground .
some 1.3 million small arms , ammunition and military machinery were sold , passed along to another country , or simply scrapped .
new units were created ; a mix of west german and east germans found themselves thrown together in companies , battalions and divisions .
recruits from eisenach -lrb- in the east -rrb- met those from koblenz -lrb- in the west -rrb- , and a dialogue was started at the most basic level .
" the bundeswehr was a kind of contact point for young people , " said digutsch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers laying a wreath in memory of all who were killed in wars yet , while young people were exchanging experiences at the bottom , those at the top faced large challenges , most of all the reduction of the army from 600,000 to 370,000 soldiers .
it was part of the peace dividend of reunification .
that meant uprooting soldiers and their families around germany in what were already turbulent times .
by the mid-90 's , the process was completed and many former nva soldiers , due to their long-time military experience , found employment with industrial companies .
future for young easterners fifteen years after the merger of the bundeswehr with the nva , the newest recruits from both halves of the country are less curious about just how much effort it took to remold the army .
of more interest is the fact that , like on the private labor market , soldiers are paid less in the east than in the west .
nevertheless , more and more young men and women from the east are joining the bundeswehr .
" we -lrb- the army -rrb- have a relative high amount of recruits coming from the east .
these ambitious young officers are of course involved in the missions abroad , " said digutsch .
" i am certain that of these young people , a few will make it up into the upper ranks .

from the former east germany , he also played a key role in the campaign to reconstruct dresden 's landmark frauenkirche , or church of our lady . born in 1943 in sosa , saxony , ludwig güttler says that october 3 , 1990 is a date he 'll never forget . " german unification was one of the most extraordinary and moving times of my life , " he said .
" it was as if a wound that had never stopped hurting finally began to heal . " success in east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig güttler has played a crucial role in the reconstruction effort in fact , güttler had been one of the lucky ones .
during east germany 's communist years , he was solo trumpeter at the händel festival orchestra in halle and the dresden philharmonic before going on to teach at the international music seminar in weimar and the carl maria von weber conservatory in dresden , where he was a professor until 1990 . even so , gaining permission to travel outside the confines of the gdr was a constant battle .
but by the time the berlin wall had fallen in 1989 , ludwig güttler was performing where and when he wanted .
he was recognized as a virtuoso of international stature and acclaimed around the world as a conductor , scholar , concert promoter and sponsor . unlike many others from the gdr , he went from strength to strength over the next 15 years , appearing as a soloist and conductor at major concert venues both at home and abroad . reclaiming an east german landmark not content with his illustrious career , he threw himself into the reconstruction of dresden 's frauenkirche , a project that cost over 100 million euros .
güttler 's appeals and fundraising activities proved invaluable . " nothing is impossible , " he said .
" the reconstruction of the frauenkirche has a crucial social significance - it was an overwhelming task in terms of building , but it also represented so much more than that . " the advantages of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again after dresden was destroyed in the allies ' fire-bombing in 1945 , the frauenkirche remained a ruin for decades .
the ruling communists were uninterested in its renovation , but it became a touchstone to east germany 's grass roots peace movement . then , after the collapse of the iron curtain , a lobby group came together that was committed to seeing the frauenkirche returned to its former glory - a development that would never have come to fruition in the gdr . despite his successful career , ludwig güttler worked tirelessly as its spokesman . " from the very start , i wanted music to remain my main priority , " he said .
" but at some point i put my work as a teacher on hold in order to devote myself to the reconstruction project . " bildunterschrift : güttler participated in charity concerts , such as this one on dec .
23 , 1993 , from the beginning but it was also his musical credentials that made his fundraising so effective .
ludwig güttler played many concerts on behalf of the frauenkirche .

britain currently holds the shared eu presidency . anthony brenton , the british ambassador in moscow , told journalists that energy would be one of the main themes . " russia is a huge and expanding energy exporter and western europe is a large and expanding energy importer , " he said .
but work is needed in " removing glitches in our scope for energy cooperation . " big supplier about half the gas and one-third of the oil used in the 25-country bloc already comes from or via russia .
according to the international energy agency , eu gas demand could rise by 50 percent in the next 15 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue is especially timely in britain , where north sea oil and gas resources are winding down .
next year , for the first time in three decades , the country is expected to become a net importer of gas . putin last week trumpeted rapid economic growth that analysts say has more to do with oil prices of around 65 dollars a barrel than any meaningful reforms .
russia is " among the leaders , " he claimed , noting that oil and gas reserves across russia " are bigger than we think .
these reserves are enough for us and future generations . " he denied monday that moscow wants to use energy sold to western europe as a way to apply political pressure .

dw 's baha güngör heaves a big sigh of relief . monday was to have marked the official launch of landmark entry talks with turkey .
but as the day approached , it seemed more and more unlikely that the negotiations would go ahead as scheduled .
chief among the trouble-makers was austria , which insisted that talks with turkey could only begin if accession negotiations were also opened with croatia . but then , contrary to all expectations , a last-ditch deal was reached after two days of tense debate - salvaging , just in the nick of time , the eu 's reputation as a sturdy super-structure able to take the heat . strategic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-awaited start of turkey 's entry talks represents an historic step for the eu , and a key reinforcement of its security interests in a strategic region .
while turkey once guarded europe 's south-eastern border as a member of nato during the cold war era , it now occupies a key position within the middle east conflict belt . the ultimate aim of the talks is , inevitably , turkish accession , but entry is by no means in the bag .
it will be years before the decision is taken whether or not to allow a politically , economically and socially transformed turkey to join the eu as a full member .
for the time being , piling on the pressure is counterproductive - all it will do is fan the flames of anti-eu sentiment within this mainly muslim country . and the turkish population 's reservations about too hasty a move towards the eu are just as understandable as europe 's wariness of turkey .
the country is well aware it still has many obstacles to weather , and it will be years before its vast regional disparities can start to narrow .
it 's a problem europe has experienced itself - and nowhere more painfully than germany , a country that has been trying to breach the gap between east and west for the last 15 years , and paying a heavy cost in the process . eu compatibility but turkey will also have to prove it is eu-compatible when it comes to democracy , human rights , the armenian question and the kurdish conflict - which will include demonstrating belief in european values in its approach to problem-solving . sorting out cyprus is another challenge turkey faces , and will be a key test of its willingness to compromise . turkey will have to adopt 35 chapters of eu law , and that means every single eu member state has 35 veto opportunities , since every chapter has to be unanimously agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik austria 's shenanigans over the last few days are more than likely to be repeated by one country or another , sooner or later . the risk of failure is acute given that every member state will have to ratify turkey 's entry agreement , some of which by referendum . after its speedy intake of eight new eastern european countries last year , which it 's still belly-aching about , the eu now has another set of problems to deal with .
at least it realized in time that it would n't have been fair to vent its frustration on turkey . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey and eu agree on membership talks the european union clinched an 11th-hour accord with turkey monday to clear the way for landmark talks with the vast mainly muslim state to go ahead , after marathon talks overcame austrian objections .

" german chancellor gerhard schröder too welcomed the move . " with it the european union has fulfilled a promise that it made to turkey 40 years ago , " the chancellor said . british foreign secretary jack straw , who 's country currently heads holds the rotating eu presidency , too said the agreement was nothing short of historic . " we are all winners : europe , the existing -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik , right , with austrian ambassador to the eu gregor woschnagg the 11th-hour deal followed nerve-wracking marathon negotiations after austria demanded that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join . long road ahead despite the widespread relief in the european union , which is still in turmoil following the crushing blow it received four months ago when french and dutch voters rejected its planned constitution , observers are still playing down monday 's deal , warning that turkey 's eventual membership could take years . fischer said the negotiations " will last a long time , ten , 15 years , perhaps more . " under the terms of the eu offer to ankara , turkey can not hope to join the bloc before 2014 , and there is no absolute guarantee of membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " europe won today .
that is for me the key point , " fischer added . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed the official start of talks with turkey to join the european union , but warned that the country must win over the skeptical european public . " europe must learn more about turkey .
and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " barroso said in a statement released late monday . " hello europe " in turkey the mood was jubiliant on tuesday . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül reiterated past ankara statements that eu entry could bridge gaps between christians and muslims and help to halt islamic militancy . " this is a win-win situation and the world will also win , " gül said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish trader reads a newspaper with a headline that reads : " we stood firm and won " the turkish media was ecstatic tuesday at the outcome of the negotiations with the eu . " hello europe " was the headline splashed on the mass-selling daily hürriyet .
" twice in history , we 've turned back from the gates leading to vienna , " the paper wrote in reference to austria 's fierce resistance to turkey 's eu membership . " now we 're entering europe on the way to peace and cooperation , " the daily wrote , adding that turkey 's 42-year-old dream of finding a place a europe , was finally become reality . another turkish daily , milliyet spoke of " a new europe and a new turkey . "
the paper wrote that it was the first time that europe was sitting down at the same table with an islamic country and called it " a crucially important step " by the eu " to become a global power . " " turkey and the eu merge their destinies , civilizations embrace , " the daily sabah wrote , while vatan praised ankara 's hard bargaining with the headline : " we stood firm , we won . " the blue and red of the eu and turkish flags were the backdrop to most front pages , while a vatan cartoon depicted the gold stars of the eu flag sparkling on the skyline between two minarets . doubts persist over full membership but elsewhere in europe , doubts persisted in conservative quarters about the wisdom of giving a populous muslim-dominated country a formal date to open eu membership talks at a time when opinion polls show that many europeans are against full membership . former french president valery giscard d 'estaing attacked the move , claiming that if successful they would undermine the basic aim of the eu . he told the rtl radio station that " france used to have a grand project - the political union of europe " - but will now " no longer have a message to bear . " he added , " we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone .
that 's what i regret . " in germany , home to the largest turkish immigrant community in europe and where the conservatives led by angela merkel are supportive of austria 's stance to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership , some papers too struck a cautious tone . " with the fixation on full membership there is the risk of the eu being destroyed by over-stretching .
so who is being stubborn here ? " the center-right frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote . the conservative die welt said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel " spoke out loud what numerous europeans think , but are not allowed to say : full eu membership for turkey is nonsense until the fundamental questions of the eu 's purpose , size and finances have been clarified .

" he added , " we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone .
that 's what i regret . " in germany , home to the largest turkish immigrant community in europe and where the conservatives led by angela merkel are supportive of austria 's stance to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership , some papers too struck a cautious tone . " with the fixation on full membership there is the risk of the eu being destroyed by over-stretching .
so who is being stubborn here ? " the center-right frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote . the conservative die welt said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel " spoke out loud what numerous europeans think , but are not allowed to say : full eu membership for turkey is nonsense until the fundamental questions of the eu 's purpose , size and finances have been clarified .

the wwf study ranked plants across the eu 's 25 member states according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .
carbon dioxide , a byproduct which results from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil , gas and coal , is the primary component of greenhouse gases that trap the sun 's heat and cause the earth 's temperature to rise . german plants among worst offenders germany is home to five of the survey 's ten dirtiest plants - four of which are run by the country 's giant power company rwe .
rwe was labeled as the biggest co2 producer in the european power sector , according to the wwf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe ag utility company headquarters in essen , germany is one of europes ' biggest producers of co2 .
" german power plants are europe 's top ' climate-killers , " ' said wwf expert regine günther . " the summer of 2005 , with the floods , droughts and heat-waves is just a taste of what can happen if co2 emissions are not drastically reduced . energy providers need to stop playing politics and finally start taking protective measures . " the wwf ranking showed that rwe plants in frimmersdorf , weisweiler , neurath and niederraussen ranked second , sixth , seventh and tenth respectively . additionally , a plant in jänschwalde operated by the swedish power company vattenfall ranked fifth . of the dirtiest power plants , 27 out of the 30 are coal-powered facilities . energy sector target of renovation " the power sector is responsible for 37 percent of all man-made co2 , " said imogen zethoven , head of the wwf 's power campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf logo world wildlife fund " coal-fired power stations rank dirtiest , because they use the most co2-intense fuel .
to switch off global warming we have to replace them with cleaner alternatives , such as gas and renewables , " she said , referring to solar , wind and water power . over the next two decades , many of the " dirty thirty " are set to be decommissioned , noted the wwf , calling this a " historic window of opportunity to cut co2 pollution . " replacing the outdated facilities with new coal power stations would result in a 13.5 percent cut in their total co2 emissions by 2030 , it said .
likewise , a shift to gas would slash co2 emissions by 47.8 percent , while replacing them with renewable energy sources would result in a 73.4 percent cut .
europe just part of the equation under the kyoto protocol , industrial countries that have ratified the treaty are required to trim pollution of carbon gases by a deadline of 2012 as compared with a 1990 benchmark .
many scientists still feel however that this effort falls far short of what is needed to avoid a rapid change in climate which could lead to a major global environmental crisis . after all , the un plan does not include the world 's top polluter , the united states , or developing countries such as china and india , where fast economic growth is driving up emissions . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

" what can i say , naturally i am overwhelmed , " hänsch told afp . hänsch , a physics professor at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-universität , and american scientist john l. hall shared half of the prize for their groundbreaking work on understanding light . their development of laser-based precision spectroscopy opens the way to the next generation of gps navigation and ultra-precise atomic clocks . how light emitted by a candle differs from the beam produced by a laser in a cd player , or how the already stunning accuracy of atomic clocks could be improved , were among questions this year 's laureates had tackled successfully , the nobel academy said . interest beyond scientific community hänsch , 63 , described his research as a " continuous project with many detours , meanders and also of course frustrations " which had led to findings that he knew would cause interest way beyond the scientific community . " it was the sort of discovery that makes headlines quickly , " he said . he said he had believed that his work would win the nobel prize one day . " i just had n't expected it to come this year , " he said . roy j. glauber , an 80-year-old physics professor at harvard university , won the other half of the nobel prize for establishing the basis of quantum optics , which explained the fundamental difference between sources of light such as light bulbs and lasers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as humans have populated the earth , we have been fascinated by optical phenomena and gradually unravelled the nature of light , " the academy said .
" with the aid of light , we can orient ourselves in our daily lives or observe the most distant galaxies of the universe . " glauber 's pioneering work on applying quantum physics to optical phenomena is over four decades old , being first reported in 1963 . the landmark development by hall and hänsch of the so-called optical frequency comb technique is much more recent , dating from the late 1990s , and shed new light on the difference between matter and anti-matter , as well as allowing time to be measured with unsurpassed precision . following einstein 's lead the 2005 prize comes exactly a century after albert einstein 's " annus mirabilis " - the miracle year in which the german-born genius wrote papers that smashed barriers to knowledge about the physical universe and reshaped our perception of it . bildunterschrift : among einstein 's achievements was ground-breaking work on the nature of light , a foundation upon which all three of this year 's nobel winners built their work . light was first described in the mid-19th century as a form of waves .
einstein , in his theory of the so-called photo-electric effect , also identified light as " lumpy " form , made of particles of energy called photons .
he won the 1921 nobel prize for this . the 2005 laureates will receive a gold medal and share a check for 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1.1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- at the formal prize ceremony held , as tradition dictates , on december 10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , alfred nobel . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

but they stayed silent about the many east-west divisions . british prime minister tony blair , currently presiding over the rotating eu presidency , underlined after talks with putin " how important today , for our own economic future and our own security , that relationship is . " " we want to take , therefore , that relationship ... to a new and more intensive , strengthened level . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who also attended the meeting with putin , told journalists the " two strategic partners " had discussed russian energy supplies to europe , terrorism , drugs trafficking , as well as iran and the middle east . they also agreed on starting to ease visa rules for certain categories of russians traveling to europe . resurgent russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oil well in northern russia near the barents sea export terminal of varandey russia is rapidly growing in wealth and diplomatic clout thanks to the enormous potential of its gas , coal and oil resources .
the country already supplies about half of eu gas needs and is the source or route for about a third of the 25-country bloc 's oil supplies . putin assured that " russia is a reliable partner " and that its resurgent power will be a force for good . " russia keeps raising its output of oil and increases its deliveries to the world market , " he said .
" it helps all the world economy , including the european economy , to grow normally and predictably . " he denied moscow might use eu dependency on russian fuel as a political lever , stressing that major new developments in the gas and oil industry involved both european and russian players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " rumors of europe losing its energy independence are highly exaggerated , " he said . putin said that russia 's rapidly growing economy " allows us favorable conditions for an independent foreign policy .
of course it 's like that . "
but , he added : " we do not intend to stick our noses in the air . " democracy concerns blair denied that the european union would soften its positions on russian democracy and human rights , particularly in chechnya , saying that such delicate questions were still on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops sit atop an apc while patrolling in grozny , chechnya " for example we discussed the issue of chechnya earlier today , " he said .
" i do n't think the relationship is one of dependence , either on the russian side or the european side .
but what it is is a recognition of a very strong set of mutual interests . " silent treatment however , in the brief remarks to journalists no time was given to the many sour points in eu-russian relations , ranging from russian backing of iran 's nuclear program to the pro-west revolution in ukraine that saw the defeat of a moscow-backed candidate in last winter 's presidential election . on tuesday the eu imposed an arms embargo on the central asian , former soviet republic of uzbekistan .
this was in response to the government 's refusal to accept an international enquiry into the suppression this may of an uprising in the eastern town of andijan . however , moscow remains a steady ally of the uzbek government and has never backed an international probe . neither was there mention of the corruption and political interference that many experts believe prevent russia from attracting greater foreign investment - and thereby transforming the still relatively small economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

2 , 2005 .
" we are all winners : europe ...
turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , where he was joined by his turkish counterpart abdullah gul . gul hailed the accord : " what is important for us is that the prospect of full membership is very clear .
there is no alternative such as a privileged partnership . " the talks had been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called negotiating framework , which sets out their principles and logistics . the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first constitution in may and june . listen and learn eu leaders have said those polls showed they need to listen more to the public .
yet the most recent survey by the union 's own eurobarometer institute shows that 52 percent of people oppose turkey 's candidacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso " europe must learn more about turkey , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso hours after the ceremony took place .
" and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " he said . britain 's tony blair hailed the talks - and said there was plenty of time to overcome all the " understandable " concerns . " it 's a very , very big change for the european union , there 's no doubt about that .
it -lrb- would -rrb- be unnatural if there were n't worries and concerns , " he said in london . croatia talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's foreign affairs and european integration minister kolinda grabar kitarovic , right , shakes hands with luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn prior to talks between the eu and croatia in luxembourg in a double breakthrough , the eu also trumpeted the start of delayed talks with ex-yugoslav state croatia , after zagreb was deemed by un prosecutors to be helping find a key warcrimes suspect . zagreb 's failure to arrest former general ante gotovina had previously blocked the former yugoslav republic 's bid to begin accession talks , which were originally due to start seven months ago . in a report to the european union on monday , the un war crimes tribunal 's chief prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia had " fully cooperated " with the hague-based tribunal in efforts to locate war crimes suspect gotovina and dismantle his support network . no guarantees the eu insists that starting membership negotiations , which are likely to take at least a decade , do not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan acknowledged the road would be long . " the real work has just begun , " he said in parliament .
" the implementation -lrb- of reforms -rrb- in particular will try us and there will be a great struggle to fully implement the harmonization laws - we will pursue our path with the same determination . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- hailed the opening of talks as a way to push forward dialogue between civilizations . " this step has created a feeling of confidence and courage among nations of the islamic world ... to pursue the democratic process ... in order to consolidate regional and international peace , " oic chief ekmeleddin ihsanoglu said . but former french president valery giscard d 'estaing - architect of the bloc 's near-dead constitution - immediately slammed the deal , which he has warned could lead to the end of the eu . " france used to have a grand project : the political union of europe , " he said .
" we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone : that 's what i regret . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .
-lrb- oct .

from the former east germany , he also played a key role in the campaign to reconstruct dresden 's landmark frauenkirche , or church of our lady . born in 1943 in sosa , saxony , ludwig güttler says that october 3 , 1990 is a date he 'll never forget . " german unification was one of the most extraordinary and moving times of my life , " he said .
" it was as if a wound that had never stopped hurting finally began to heal . " success in east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig güttler has played a crucial role in the reconstruction effort in fact , güttler had been one of the lucky ones .
during east germany 's communist years , he was solo trumpeter at the händel festival orchestra in halle and the dresden philharmonic before going on to teach at the international music seminar in weimar and the carl maria von weber conservatory in dresden , where he was a professor until 1990 . even so , gaining permission to travel outside the confines of the gdr was a constant battle .
but by the time the berlin wall had fallen in 1989 , ludwig güttler was performing where and when he wanted .
he was recognized as a virtuoso of international stature and acclaimed around the world as a conductor , scholar , concert promoter and sponsor . unlike many others from the gdr , he went from strength to strength over the next 15 years , appearing as a soloist and conductor at major concert venues both at home and abroad . reclaiming an east german landmark not content with his illustrious career , he threw himself into the reconstruction of dresden 's frauenkirche , a project that cost over 100 million euros .
güttler 's appeals and fundraising activities proved invaluable . " nothing is impossible , " he said .
" the reconstruction of the frauenkirche has a crucial social significance - it was an overwhelming task in terms of building , but it also represented so much more than that . " the advantages of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again after dresden was destroyed in the allies ' fire-bombing in 1945 , the frauenkirche remained a ruin for decades .
the ruling communists were uninterested in its renovation , but it became a touchstone to east germany 's grass roots peace movement . then , after the collapse of the iron curtain , a lobby group came together that was committed to seeing the frauenkirche returned to its former glory - a development that would never have come to fruition in the gdr . despite his successful career , ludwig güttler worked tirelessly as its spokesman . " from the very start , i wanted music to remain my main priority , " he said .
" but at some point i put my work as a teacher on hold in order to devote myself to the reconstruction project . " bildunterschrift : güttler participated in charity concerts , such as this one on dec .
23 , 1993 , from the beginning but it was also his musical credentials that made his fundraising so effective .
ludwig güttler played many concerts on behalf of the frauenkirche .
today , he says it was worth it . " coming here now and seeing all the people gathered gives me a great sense of joy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

" it was as if a wound that had never stopped hurting finally began to heal . " success in east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig güttler has played a crucial role in the reconstruction effort in fact , güttler had been one of the lucky ones .
during east germany 's communist years , he was solo trumpeter at the händel festival orchestra in halle and the dresden philharmonic before going on to teach at the international music seminar in weimar and the carl maria von weber conservatory in dresden , where he was a professor until 1990 . even so , gaining permission to travel outside the confines of the gdr was a constant battle .
but by the time the berlin wall had fallen in 1989 , ludwig güttler was performing where and when he wanted .
he was recognized as a virtuoso of international stature and acclaimed around the world as a conductor , scholar , concert promoter and sponsor . unlike many others from the gdr , he went from strength to strength over the next 15 years , appearing as a soloist and conductor at major concert venues both at home and abroad . reclaiming an east german landmark not content with his illustrious career , he threw himself into the reconstruction of dresden 's frauenkirche , a project that cost over 100 million euros .
güttler 's appeals and fundraising activities proved invaluable . " nothing is impossible , " he said .
" the reconstruction of the frauenkirche has a crucial social significance - it was an overwhelming task in terms of building , but it also represented so much more than that . " the advantages of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again after dresden was destroyed in the allies ' fire-bombing in 1945 , the frauenkirche remained a ruin for decades .
the ruling communists were uninterested in its renovation , but it became a touchstone to east germany 's grass roots peace movement . then , after the collapse of the iron curtain , a lobby group came together that was committed to seeing the frauenkirche returned to its former glory - a development that would never have come to fruition in the gdr . despite his successful career , ludwig güttler worked tirelessly as its spokesman . " from the very start , i wanted music to remain my main priority , " he said .
" but at some point i put my work as a teacher on hold in order to devote myself to the reconstruction project . " bildunterschrift : güttler participated in charity concerts , such as this one on dec .
23 , 1993 , from the beginning but it was also his musical credentials that made his fundraising so effective .
ludwig güttler played many concerts on behalf of the frauenkirche .
today , he says it was worth it . " coming here now and seeing all the people gathered gives me a great sense of joy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink . the beer festival to end all beer festivals was actually a day longer this year than in the past ; it ran until monday 's unity day holiday .
but despite the extra time to tipple , less beer was actually guzzled at this year 's boozy bash than in the past . the 172nd oktoberfest still saw a lot of beer flow down a lot of gullets .
some 6.1 million people descended on the tents set up in the bavarian capital munich to engage in an orgy of beer drinking , pretzel-munching and bratwurst-noshing .
that beat last year 's crowd of 5.9 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down the hatch and while the amount of food consumed also jumped - the number of cows slaughtered rose from 89 to 95 - the amount of the sudsy stuff imbibed fell .
about 6 million liters -lrb- 13 million pints -rrb- of beer were downed , but that is about 100,000 liters below 2004 levels . the unseasonably cool and often wet weather might have dampened the drinking spirit .
others said new regulations that called for the volume of music played - including the famous oom-pah bands - to be lowered before 6 p.m. could have played a role . " when the music volume is lower people tend to drink a bit less but instead eat more , " said gabriele weishäupel , head of the munich tourist office . police are happy about it , reporting a drop in the number of assaults at the festival , down 248 this year compared to 351 last year .

" what can i say , naturally i am overwhelmed , " hänsch told afp . hänsch , a physics professor at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-universität , and american scientist john l. hall shared half of the prize for their groundbreaking work on understanding light . their development of laser-based precision spectroscopy opens the way to the next generation of gps navigation and ultra-precise atomic clocks . how light emitted by a candle differs from the beam produced by a laser in a cd player , or how the already stunning accuracy of atomic clocks could be improved , were among questions this year 's laureates had tackled successfully , the nobel academy said . interest beyond scientific community hänsch , 63 , described his research as a " continuous project with many detours , meanders and also of course frustrations " which had led to findings that he knew would cause interest way beyond the scientific community . " it was the sort of discovery that makes headlines quickly , " he said . he said he had believed that his work would win the nobel prize one day . " i just had n't expected it to come this year , " he said . roy j. glauber , an 80-year-old physics professor at harvard university , won the other half of the nobel prize for establishing the basis of quantum optics , which explained the fundamental difference between sources of light such as light bulbs and lasers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as humans have populated the earth , we have been fascinated by optical phenomena and gradually unravelled the nature of light , " the academy said .
" with the aid of light , we can orient ourselves in our daily lives or observe the most distant galaxies of the universe . " glauber 's pioneering work on applying quantum physics to optical phenomena is over four decades old , being first reported in 1963 . the landmark development by hall and hänsch of the so-called optical frequency comb technique is much more recent , dating from the late 1990s , and shed new light on the difference between matter and anti-matter , as well as allowing time to be measured with unsurpassed precision . following einstein 's lead the 2005 prize comes exactly a century after albert einstein 's " annus mirabilis " - the miracle year in which the german-born genius wrote papers that smashed barriers to knowledge about the physical universe and reshaped our perception of it . bildunterschrift : among einstein 's achievements was ground-breaking work on the nature of light , a foundation upon which all three of this year 's nobel winners built their work . light was first described in the mid-19th century as a form of waves .
einstein , in his theory of the so-called photo-electric effect , also identified light as " lumpy " form , made of particles of energy called photons .
he won the 1921 nobel prize for this . the 2005 laureates will receive a gold medal and share a check for 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1.1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- at the formal prize ceremony held , as tradition dictates , on december 10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , alfred nobel . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

" german chancellor gerhard schröder too welcomed the move . " with it the european union has fulfilled a promise that it made to turkey 40 years ago , " the chancellor said . british foreign secretary jack straw , who 's country currently heads holds the rotating eu presidency , too said the agreement was nothing short of historic . " we are all winners : europe , the existing -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik , right , with austrian ambassador to the eu gregor woschnagg the 11th-hour deal followed nerve-wracking marathon negotiations after austria demanded that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join . long road ahead despite the widespread relief in the european union , which is still in turmoil following the crushing blow it received four months ago when french and dutch voters rejected its planned constitution , observers are still playing down monday 's deal , warning that turkey 's eventual membership could take years . fischer said the negotiations " will last a long time , ten , 15 years , perhaps more . " under the terms of the eu offer to ankara , turkey can not hope to join the bloc before 2014 , and there is no absolute guarantee of membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " europe won today .
that is for me the key point , " fischer added . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed the official start of talks with turkey to join the european union , but warned that the country must win over the skeptical european public . " europe must learn more about turkey .
and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " barroso said in a statement released late monday . " hello europe " in turkey the mood was jubiliant on tuesday . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül reiterated past ankara statements that eu entry could bridge gaps between christians and muslims and help to halt islamic militancy . " this is a win-win situation and the world will also win , " gül said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish trader reads a newspaper with a headline that reads : " we stood firm and won " the turkish media was ecstatic tuesday at the outcome of the negotiations with the eu . " hello europe " was the headline splashed on the mass-selling daily hürriyet .
" twice in history , we 've turned back from the gates leading to vienna , " the paper wrote in reference to austria 's fierce resistance to turkey 's eu membership . " now we 're entering europe on the way to peace and cooperation , " the daily wrote , adding that turkey 's 42-year-old dream of finding a place a europe , was finally become reality . another turkish daily , milliyet spoke of " a new europe and a new turkey . "
the paper wrote that it was the first time that europe was sitting down at the same table with an islamic country and called it " a crucially important step " by the eu " to become a global power . " " turkey and the eu merge their destinies , civilizations embrace , " the daily sabah wrote , while vatan praised ankara 's hard bargaining with the headline : " we stood firm , we won . " the blue and red of the eu and turkish flags were the backdrop to most front pages , while a vatan cartoon depicted the gold stars of the eu flag sparkling on the skyline between two minarets . doubts persist over full membership but elsewhere in europe , doubts persisted in conservative quarters about the wisdom of giving a populous muslim-dominated country a formal date to open eu membership talks at a time when opinion polls show that many europeans are against full membership . former french president valery giscard d 'estaing attacked the move , claiming that if successful they would undermine the basic aim of the eu . he told the rtl radio station that " france used to have a grand project - the political union of europe " - but will now " no longer have a message to bear . " he added , " we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone .
that 's what i regret . " in germany , home to the largest turkish immigrant community in europe and where the conservatives led by angela merkel are supportive of austria 's stance to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership , some papers too struck a cautious tone . " with the fixation on full membership there is the risk of the eu being destroyed by over-stretching .
so who is being stubborn here ? " the center-right frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote . the conservative die welt said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel " spoke out loud what numerous europeans think , but are not allowed to say : full eu membership for turkey is nonsense until the fundamental questions of the eu 's purpose , size and finances have been clarified .

britain currently holds the shared eu presidency . anthony brenton , the british ambassador in moscow , told journalists that energy would be one of the main themes . " russia is a huge and expanding energy exporter and western europe is a large and expanding energy importer , " he said .
but work is needed in " removing glitches in our scope for energy cooperation . " big supplier about half the gas and one-third of the oil used in the 25-country bloc already comes from or via russia .
according to the international energy agency , eu gas demand could rise by 50 percent in the next 15 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue is especially timely in britain , where north sea oil and gas resources are winding down .
next year , for the first time in three decades , the country is expected to become a net importer of gas . putin last week trumpeted rapid economic growth that analysts say has more to do with oil prices of around 65 dollars a barrel than any meaningful reforms .
russia is " among the leaders , " he claimed , noting that oil and gas reserves across russia " are bigger than we think .
these reserves are enough for us and future generations . " he denied monday that moscow wants to use energy sold to western europe as a way to apply political pressure .
the participation of western companies in building a gas pipeline under the baltic and of russian companies ' in distributing gas and electricity in europe " will help to create a very stable system , " he told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the torshok-tjumen gas pipeline in der russian region of yaroslav the geo-politically sensitive gas pipeline is to be built under the baltic sea to ship fuel directly to germany , bypassing much of eastern europe and recent eu members such as poland , where relations with moscow are more tense . however , officials on both sides are going out of their way to stress common points . ambassador brenton played down russia 's recent scuppering of an eu attempt to censure iran over its civilian nuclear activities , saying : " my feeling is that this was no more than a tactical divergence . " both sides " are firmly committed to preventing iran from getting nuclear weapons . " wto , visas and anti-terrorism meanwhile , the eu ambassador to moscow , marc franco , expressed support for russia 's entry into the world trade organization and for a relaxing of eu visa rules for russia . for students , bureaucrats , journalists and others needing to travel because of their occupation , " it will be much easier in the future to get multiple-entry and long-term visas , " he told journalists . another major item on the agenda - and the top item in wednesday 's britain-russia talks - will be cooperation in anti-terrorism policies , diplomats said . although london and moscow are talking up cooperation in this area , the kremlin remains infuriated by its failure to extradite akhmed zakayev , a leading chechen separatist representative given political asylum in britain . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .

" german chancellor gerhard schröder too welcomed the move . " with it the european union has fulfilled a promise that it made to turkey 40 years ago , " the chancellor said . british foreign secretary jack straw , who 's country currently heads holds the rotating eu presidency , too said the agreement was nothing short of historic . " we are all winners : europe , the existing -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik , right , with austrian ambassador to the eu gregor woschnagg the 11th-hour deal followed nerve-wracking marathon negotiations after austria demanded that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join . long road ahead despite the widespread relief in the european union , which is still in turmoil following the crushing blow it received four months ago when french and dutch voters rejected its planned constitution , observers are still playing down monday 's deal , warning that turkey 's eventual membership could take years . fischer said the negotiations " will last a long time , ten , 15 years , perhaps more . " under the terms of the eu offer to ankara , turkey can not hope to join the bloc before 2014 , and there is no absolute guarantee of membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " europe won today .
that is for me the key point , " fischer added . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed the official start of talks with turkey to join the european union , but warned that the country must win over the skeptical european public . " europe must learn more about turkey .
and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " barroso said in a statement released late monday . " hello europe " in turkey the mood was jubiliant on tuesday . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül reiterated past ankara statements that eu entry could bridge gaps between christians and muslims and help to halt islamic militancy . " this is a win-win situation and the world will also win , " gül said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish trader reads a newspaper with a headline that reads : " we stood firm and won " the turkish media was ecstatic tuesday at the outcome of the negotiations with the eu . " hello europe " was the headline splashed on the mass-selling daily hürriyet .
" twice in history , we 've turned back from the gates leading to vienna , " the paper wrote in reference to austria 's fierce resistance to turkey 's eu membership . " now we 're entering europe on the way to peace and cooperation , " the daily wrote , adding that turkey 's 42-year-old dream of finding a place a europe , was finally become reality . another turkish daily , milliyet spoke of " a new europe and a new turkey . "
the paper wrote that it was the first time that europe was sitting down at the same table with an islamic country and called it " a crucially important step " by the eu " to become a global power . " " turkey and the eu merge their destinies , civilizations embrace , " the daily sabah wrote , while vatan praised ankara 's hard bargaining with the headline : " we stood firm , we won . " the blue and red of the eu and turkish flags were the backdrop to most front pages , while a vatan cartoon depicted the gold stars of the eu flag sparkling on the skyline between two minarets . doubts persist over full membership but elsewhere in europe , doubts persisted in conservative quarters about the wisdom of giving a populous muslim-dominated country a formal date to open eu membership talks at a time when opinion polls show that many europeans are against full membership . former french president valery giscard d 'estaing attacked the move , claiming that if successful they would undermine the basic aim of the eu . he told the rtl radio station that " france used to have a grand project - the political union of europe " - but will now " no longer have a message to bear . " he added , " we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone .
that 's what i regret . " in germany , home to the largest turkish immigrant community in europe and where the conservatives led by angela merkel are supportive of austria 's stance to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership , some papers too struck a cautious tone . " with the fixation on full membership there is the risk of the eu being destroyed by over-stretching .
so who is being stubborn here ? " the center-right frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote . the conservative die welt said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel " spoke out loud what numerous europeans think , but are not allowed to say : full eu membership for turkey is nonsense until the fundamental questions of the eu 's purpose , size and finances have been clarified .

dw 's baha güngör heaves a big sigh of relief . monday was to have marked the official launch of landmark entry talks with turkey .
but as the day approached , it seemed more and more unlikely that the negotiations would go ahead as scheduled .
chief among the trouble-makers was austria , which insisted that talks with turkey could only begin if accession negotiations were also opened with croatia . but then , contrary to all expectations , a last-ditch deal was reached after two days of tense debate - salvaging , just in the nick of time , the eu 's reputation as a sturdy super-structure able to take the heat . strategic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-awaited start of turkey 's entry talks represents an historic step for the eu , and a key reinforcement of its security interests in a strategic region .
while turkey once guarded europe 's south-eastern border as a member of nato during the cold war era , it now occupies a key position within the middle east conflict belt . the ultimate aim of the talks is , inevitably , turkish accession , but entry is by no means in the bag .
it will be years before the decision is taken whether or not to allow a politically , economically and socially transformed turkey to join the eu as a full member .
for the time being , piling on the pressure is counterproductive - all it will do is fan the flames of anti-eu sentiment within this mainly muslim country . and the turkish population 's reservations about too hasty a move towards the eu are just as understandable as europe 's wariness of turkey .
the country is well aware it still has many obstacles to weather , and it will be years before its vast regional disparities can start to narrow .
it 's a problem europe has experienced itself - and nowhere more painfully than germany , a country that has been trying to breach the gap between east and west for the last 15 years , and paying a heavy cost in the process . eu compatibility but turkey will also have to prove it is eu-compatible when it comes to democracy , human rights , the armenian question and the kurdish conflict - which will include demonstrating belief in european values in its approach to problem-solving . sorting out cyprus is another challenge turkey faces , and will be a key test of its willingness to compromise . turkey will have to adopt 35 chapters of eu law , and that means every single eu member state has 35 veto opportunities , since every chapter has to be unanimously agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik austria 's shenanigans over the last few days are more than likely to be repeated by one country or another , sooner or later . the risk of failure is acute given that every member state will have to ratify turkey 's entry agreement , some of which by referendum . after its speedy intake of eight new eastern european countries last year , which it 's still belly-aching about , the eu now has another set of problems to deal with .
at least it realized in time that it would n't have been fair to vent its frustration on turkey . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey and eu agree on membership talks the european union clinched an 11th-hour accord with turkey monday to clear the way for landmark talks with the vast mainly muslim state to go ahead , after marathon talks overcame austrian objections .

from the former east germany , he also played a key role in the campaign to reconstruct dresden 's landmark frauenkirche , or church of our lady . born in 1943 in sosa , saxony , ludwig güttler says that october 3 , 1990 is a date he 'll never forget . " german unification was one of the most extraordinary and moving times of my life , " he said .
" it was as if a wound that had never stopped hurting finally began to heal . " success in east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig güttler has played a crucial role in the reconstruction effort in fact , güttler had been one of the lucky ones .
during east germany 's communist years , he was solo trumpeter at the händel festival orchestra in halle and the dresden philharmonic before going on to teach at the international music seminar in weimar and the carl maria von weber conservatory in dresden , where he was a professor until 1990 . even so , gaining permission to travel outside the confines of the gdr was a constant battle .
but by the time the berlin wall had fallen in 1989 , ludwig güttler was performing where and when he wanted .
he was recognized as a virtuoso of international stature and acclaimed around the world as a conductor , scholar , concert promoter and sponsor . unlike many others from the gdr , he went from strength to strength over the next 15 years , appearing as a soloist and conductor at major concert venues both at home and abroad . reclaiming an east german landmark not content with his illustrious career , he threw himself into the reconstruction of dresden 's frauenkirche , a project that cost over 100 million euros .
güttler 's appeals and fundraising activities proved invaluable . " nothing is impossible , " he said .
" the reconstruction of the frauenkirche has a crucial social significance - it was an overwhelming task in terms of building , but it also represented so much more than that . " the advantages of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again after dresden was destroyed in the allies ' fire-bombing in 1945 , the frauenkirche remained a ruin for decades .
the ruling communists were uninterested in its renovation , but it became a touchstone to east germany 's grass roots peace movement . then , after the collapse of the iron curtain , a lobby group came together that was committed to seeing the frauenkirche returned to its former glory - a development that would never have come to fruition in the gdr . despite his successful career , ludwig güttler worked tirelessly as its spokesman . " from the very start , i wanted music to remain my main priority , " he said .
" but at some point i put my work as a teacher on hold in order to devote myself to the reconstruction project . " bildunterschrift : güttler participated in charity concerts , such as this one on dec .
23 , 1993 , from the beginning but it was also his musical credentials that made his fundraising so effective .
ludwig güttler played many concerts on behalf of the frauenkirche .
today , he says it was worth it .

2 , 2005 .
" we are all winners : europe ...
turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , where he was joined by his turkish counterpart abdullah gul . gul hailed the accord : " what is important for us is that the prospect of full membership is very clear .
there is no alternative such as a privileged partnership . " the talks had been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called negotiating framework , which sets out their principles and logistics . the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first constitution in may and june . listen and learn eu leaders have said those polls showed they need to listen more to the public .
yet the most recent survey by the union 's own eurobarometer institute shows that 52 percent of people oppose turkey 's candidacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso " europe must learn more about turkey , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso hours after the ceremony took place .
" and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " he said . britain 's tony blair hailed the talks - and said there was plenty of time to overcome all the " understandable " concerns . " it 's a very , very big change for the european union , there 's no doubt about that .
it -lrb- would -rrb- be unnatural if there were n't worries and concerns , " he said in london . croatia talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's foreign affairs and european integration minister kolinda grabar kitarovic , right , shakes hands with luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn prior to talks between the eu and croatia in luxembourg in a double breakthrough , the eu also trumpeted the start of delayed talks with ex-yugoslav state croatia , after zagreb was deemed by un prosecutors to be helping find a key warcrimes suspect . zagreb 's failure to arrest former general ante gotovina had previously blocked the former yugoslav republic 's bid to begin accession talks , which were originally due to start seven months ago . in a report to the european union on monday , the un war crimes tribunal 's chief prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia had " fully cooperated " with the hague-based tribunal in efforts to locate war crimes suspect gotovina and dismantle his support network . no guarantees the eu insists that starting membership negotiations , which are likely to take at least a decade , do not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan acknowledged the road would be long . " the real work has just begun , " he said in parliament .
" the implementation -lrb- of reforms -rrb- in particular will try us and there will be a great struggle to fully implement the harmonization laws - we will pursue our path with the same determination . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- hailed the opening of talks as a way to push forward dialogue between civilizations . " this step has created a feeling of confidence and courage among nations of the islamic world ... to pursue the democratic process ... in order to consolidate regional and international peace , " oic chief ekmeleddin ihsanoglu said . but former french president valery giscard d 'estaing - architect of the bloc 's near-dead constitution - immediately slammed the deal , which he has warned could lead to the end of the eu . " france used to have a grand project : the political union of europe , " he said .
" we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone : that 's what i regret .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's path to the eu relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal breaking the mold eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey opinion : merkel 's turkish delight europe -pipe- 04.10.2005 opinion : eu and turkey take historic step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's boat has finally come in the eu 's wrangling over the negotiation framework with turkey over accession has finally reached a happy conclusion .
dw 's baha güngör heaves a big sigh of relief . monday was to have marked the official launch of landmark entry talks with turkey .
but as the day approached , it seemed more and more unlikely that the negotiations would go ahead as scheduled .
chief among the trouble-makers was austria , which insisted that talks with turkey could only begin if accession negotiations were also opened with croatia . but then , contrary to all expectations , a last-ditch deal was reached after two days of tense debate - salvaging , just in the nick of time , the eu 's reputation as a sturdy super-structure able to take the heat . strategic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-awaited start of turkey 's entry talks represents an historic step for the eu , and a key reinforcement of its security interests in a strategic region .
while turkey once guarded europe 's south-eastern border as a member of nato during the cold war era , it now occupies a key position within the middle east conflict belt . the ultimate aim of the talks is , inevitably , turkish accession , but entry is by no means in the bag .
it will be years before the decision is taken whether or not to allow a politically , economically and socially transformed turkey to join the eu as a full member .
for the time being , piling on the pressure is counterproductive - all it will do is fan the flames of anti-eu sentiment within this mainly muslim country . and the turkish population 's reservations about too hasty a move towards the eu are just as understandable as europe 's wariness of turkey .
the country is well aware it still has many obstacles to weather , and it will be years before its vast regional disparities can start to narrow .
it 's a problem europe has experienced itself - and nowhere more painfully than germany , a country that has been trying to breach the gap between east and west for the last 15 years , and paying a heavy cost in the process . eu compatibility but turkey will also have to prove it is eu-compatible when it comes to democracy , human rights , the armenian question and the kurdish conflict - which will include demonstrating belief in european values in its approach to problem-solving . sorting out cyprus is another challenge turkey faces , and will be a key test of its willingness to compromise . turkey will have to adopt 35 chapters of eu law , and that means every single eu member state has 35 veto opportunities , since every chapter has to be unanimously agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik austria 's shenanigans over the last few days are more than likely to be repeated by one country or another , sooner or later . the risk of failure is acute given that every member state will have to ratify turkey 's entry agreement , some of which by referendum . after its speedy intake of eight new eastern european countries last year , which it 's still belly-aching about , the eu now has another set of problems to deal with .
at least it realized in time that it would n't have been fair to vent its frustration on turkey . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey and eu agree on membership talks the european union clinched an 11th-hour accord with turkey monday to clear the way for landmark talks with the vast mainly muslim state to go ahead , after marathon talks overcame austrian objections .
-lrb- oct .
3 , 2005 -rrb- turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .
-lrb- oct .
3 , 2005 -rrb- turkey challenges eu to be " world player " turkey 's prime minister challenged the european union on sunday to be a " world player " rather than a " christian club , " as the bloc deliberated whether to open formal membership talks with the largely muslim country .

" what can i say , naturally i am overwhelmed , " hänsch told afp . hänsch , a physics professor at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-universität , and american scientist john l. hall shared half of the prize for their groundbreaking work on understanding light . their development of laser-based precision spectroscopy opens the way to the next generation of gps navigation and ultra-precise atomic clocks . how light emitted by a candle differs from the beam produced by a laser in a cd player , or how the already stunning accuracy of atomic clocks could be improved , were among questions this year 's laureates had tackled successfully , the nobel academy said . interest beyond scientific community hänsch , 63 , described his research as a " continuous project with many detours , meanders and also of course frustrations " which had led to findings that he knew would cause interest way beyond the scientific community . " it was the sort of discovery that makes headlines quickly , " he said . he said he had believed that his work would win the nobel prize one day . " i just had n't expected it to come this year , " he said . roy j. glauber , an 80-year-old physics professor at harvard university , won the other half of the nobel prize for establishing the basis of quantum optics , which explained the fundamental difference between sources of light such as light bulbs and lasers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as humans have populated the earth , we have been fascinated by optical phenomena and gradually unravelled the nature of light , " the academy said .
" with the aid of light , we can orient ourselves in our daily lives or observe the most distant galaxies of the universe . " glauber 's pioneering work on applying quantum physics to optical phenomena is over four decades old , being first reported in 1963 . the landmark development by hall and hänsch of the so-called optical frequency comb technique is much more recent , dating from the late 1990s , and shed new light on the difference between matter and anti-matter , as well as allowing time to be measured with unsurpassed precision . following einstein 's lead the 2005 prize comes exactly a century after albert einstein 's " annus mirabilis " - the miracle year in which the german-born genius wrote papers that smashed barriers to knowledge about the physical universe and reshaped our perception of it . bildunterschrift : among einstein 's achievements was ground-breaking work on the nature of light , a foundation upon which all three of this year 's nobel winners built their work . light was first described in the mid-19th century as a form of waves .
einstein , in his theory of the so-called photo-electric effect , also identified light as " lumpy " form , made of particles of energy called photons .
he won the 1921 nobel prize for this . the 2005 laureates will receive a gold medal and share a check for 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1.1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- at the formal prize ceremony held , as tradition dictates , on december 10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , alfred nobel . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's path to the eu relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal breaking the mold eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey opinion : merkel 's turkish delight europe -pipe- 04.10.2005 opinion : eu and turkey take historic step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's boat has finally come in the eu 's wrangling over the negotiation framework with turkey over accession has finally reached a happy conclusion .
dw 's baha güngör heaves a big sigh of relief . monday was to have marked the official launch of landmark entry talks with turkey .
but as the day approached , it seemed more and more unlikely that the negotiations would go ahead as scheduled .
chief among the trouble-makers was austria , which insisted that talks with turkey could only begin if accession negotiations were also opened with croatia . but then , contrary to all expectations , a last-ditch deal was reached after two days of tense debate - salvaging , just in the nick of time , the eu 's reputation as a sturdy super-structure able to take the heat . strategic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-awaited start of turkey 's entry talks represents an historic step for the eu , and a key reinforcement of its security interests in a strategic region .
while turkey once guarded europe 's south-eastern border as a member of nato during the cold war era , it now occupies a key position within the middle east conflict belt . the ultimate aim of the talks is , inevitably , turkish accession , but entry is by no means in the bag .
it will be years before the decision is taken whether or not to allow a politically , economically and socially transformed turkey to join the eu as a full member .
for the time being , piling on the pressure is counterproductive - all it will do is fan the flames of anti-eu sentiment within this mainly muslim country . and the turkish population 's reservations about too hasty a move towards the eu are just as understandable as europe 's wariness of turkey .
the country is well aware it still has many obstacles to weather , and it will be years before its vast regional disparities can start to narrow .
it 's a problem europe has experienced itself - and nowhere more painfully than germany , a country that has been trying to breach the gap between east and west for the last 15 years , and paying a heavy cost in the process . eu compatibility but turkey will also have to prove it is eu-compatible when it comes to democracy , human rights , the armenian question and the kurdish conflict - which will include demonstrating belief in european values in its approach to problem-solving . sorting out cyprus is another challenge turkey faces , and will be a key test of its willingness to compromise . turkey will have to adopt 35 chapters of eu law , and that means every single eu member state has 35 veto opportunities , since every chapter has to be unanimously agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik austria 's shenanigans over the last few days are more than likely to be repeated by one country or another , sooner or later . the risk of failure is acute given that every member state will have to ratify turkey 's entry agreement , some of which by referendum . after its speedy intake of eight new eastern european countries last year , which it 's still belly-aching about , the eu now has another set of problems to deal with .
at least it realized in time that it would n't have been fair to vent its frustration on turkey . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey and eu agree on membership talks the european union clinched an 11th-hour accord with turkey monday to clear the way for landmark talks with the vast mainly muslim state to go ahead , after marathon talks overcame austrian objections .
-lrb- oct .
3 , 2005 -rrb- turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .

3 , 2005 -rrb- turkey challenges eu to be " world player " turkey 's prime minister challenged the european union on sunday to be a " world player " rather than a " christian club , " as the bloc deliberated whether to open formal membership talks with the largely muslim country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's path to the eu relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal breaking the mold eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey opinion : merkel 's turkish delight europe -pipe- 04.10.2005 opinion : eu and turkey take historic step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's boat has finally come in the eu 's wrangling over the negotiation framework with turkey over accession has finally reached a happy conclusion .
dw 's baha güngör heaves a big sigh of relief . monday was to have marked the official launch of landmark entry talks with turkey .
but as the day approached , it seemed more and more unlikely that the negotiations would go ahead as scheduled .
chief among the trouble-makers was austria , which insisted that talks with turkey could only begin if accession negotiations were also opened with croatia . but then , contrary to all expectations , a last-ditch deal was reached after two days of tense debate - salvaging , just in the nick of time , the eu 's reputation as a sturdy super-structure able to take the heat . strategic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-awaited start of turkey 's entry talks represents an historic step for the eu , and a key reinforcement of its security interests in a strategic region .
while turkey once guarded europe 's south-eastern border as a member of nato during the cold war era , it now occupies a key position within the middle east conflict belt . the ultimate aim of the talks is , inevitably , turkish accession , but entry is by no means in the bag .
it will be years before the decision is taken whether or not to allow a politically , economically and socially transformed turkey to join the eu as a full member .
for the time being , piling on the pressure is counterproductive - all it will do is fan the flames of anti-eu sentiment within this mainly muslim country . and the turkish population 's reservations about too hasty a move towards the eu are just as understandable as europe 's wariness of turkey .
the country is well aware it still has many obstacles to weather , and it will be years before its vast regional disparities can start to narrow .
it 's a problem europe has experienced itself - and nowhere more painfully than germany , a country that has been trying to breach the gap between east and west for the last 15 years , and paying a heavy cost in the process . eu compatibility but turkey will also have to prove it is eu-compatible when it comes to democracy , human rights , the armenian question and the kurdish conflict - which will include demonstrating belief in european values in its approach to problem-solving . sorting out cyprus is another challenge turkey faces , and will be a key test of its willingness to compromise . turkey will have to adopt 35 chapters of eu law , and that means every single eu member state has 35 veto opportunities , since every chapter has to be unanimously agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik austria 's shenanigans over the last few days are more than likely to be repeated by one country or another , sooner or later . the risk of failure is acute given that every member state will have to ratify turkey 's entry agreement , some of which by referendum . after its speedy intake of eight new eastern european countries last year , which it 's still belly-aching about , the eu now has another set of problems to deal with .
at least it realized in time that it would n't have been fair to vent its frustration on turkey . baha güngör -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey and eu agree on membership talks the european union clinched an 11th-hour accord with turkey monday to clear the way for landmark talks with the vast mainly muslim state to go ahead , after marathon talks overcame austrian objections .

the two german armies , once prepared to shoot at each other , had to put mistrust aside and be combined smoothly into one unit . the german army , the bundeswehr , has been marking its 50th anniversary this year with numerous ceremonies . fifteen years ago it swallowed up the east german combat forces , the national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- , when the official reunification of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- took effect .
the two armies had different traditions , different mentalities and different leadership styles .
the nva soldiers would have to go through a more difficult transition than the majority of east germans .
" on october 2nd , the -lrb- east german -rrb- soldiers went into their barracks in nva uniforms and on the next morning they came out in olive green nato colors , " remembered jörg schönbohm , who was at that time the head of the bundeswehr 's eastern command .
" the gdr flag was lowered , the flag of the federal republic raised .
the mood was subdued , marked by waiting , and by mistrust . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one time warsaw pact members .
in 1990 , the nva ceased to exist and became part of the bundeswehr , a nato member in an instant , the size of the bundeswehr increased by 90,000 soldiers .
not everyone in the former warsaw pact member wanted to see the immediate dissolution of the army but the government in bonn , the capital at that time , said there was no chance that two armies would stand side-by-side or that there would even be an nva department within the defense ministry .
east germany left marks on the nva fifty-thousand former east german soldiers decided that they had an opportunity to further their careers in the bundeswehr and signed on for two years .
there would be exceptions as to who could become bundeswehr soldiers .
almost all high-ranking officers were excluded from continuing their work in the military .
bildunterschrift : nva members on maneuver " the sed -lrb- the east germany coimmunist party -rrb- dictatorship has left its mark , " stressed then defense minister gerhard stoltenberg , pointing out that most generals and admirals had been members of the sed .
they would be unable to impart the bundeswehr 's motto of inner leadership and the citizen in uniform .
the highest officers had simply been molded by the sed .
" the command-giving tactic had to be replaced by the assignment-giving tactic . -lrb- ... -rrb-
this was something that most nva officers learned with great effort , " said gunnar digutsch , nva expert from the university of hanover .
not only were commissioned nva officers finding it difficult in the bundeswehr .
already after one year , three-quarters of those who resigned to serve their new army had quit .
the " army of unity " was sold to the public as a success , but it was mostly young recruits who had not yet been indoctrinated into the nva ideology , who mentally accepted unity .
the army as an example of dialogue the nva had to be completely made over .
military barracks were renovated or razed to the ground .
some 1.3 million small arms , ammunition and military machinery were sold , passed along to another country , or simply scrapped .
new units were created ; a mix of west german and east germans found themselves thrown together in companies , battalions and divisions .
recruits from eisenach -lrb- in the east -rrb- met those from koblenz -lrb- in the west -rrb- , and a dialogue was started at the most basic level .
" the bundeswehr was a kind of contact point for young people , " said digutsch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers laying a wreath in memory of all who were killed in wars yet , while young people were exchanging experiences at the bottom , those at the top faced large challenges , most of all the reduction of the army from 600,000 to 370,000 soldiers .
it was part of the peace dividend of reunification .
that meant uprooting soldiers and their families around germany in what were already turbulent times .
by the mid-90 's , the process was completed and many former nva soldiers , due to their long-time military experience , found employment with industrial companies .
future for young easterners fifteen years after the merger of the bundeswehr with the nva , the newest recruits from both halves of the country are less curious about just how much effort it took to remold the army .
of more interest is the fact that , like on the private labor market , soldiers are paid less in the east than in the west .
nevertheless , more and more young men and women from the east are joining the bundeswehr .
" we -lrb- the army -rrb- have a relative high amount of recruits coming from the east .
these ambitious young officers are of course involved in the missions abroad , " said digutsch .
" i am certain that of these young people , a few will make it up into the upper ranks .

but they stayed silent about the many east-west divisions . british prime minister tony blair , currently presiding over the rotating eu presidency , underlined after talks with putin " how important today , for our own economic future and our own security , that relationship is . " " we want to take , therefore , that relationship ... to a new and more intensive , strengthened level . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who also attended the meeting with putin , told journalists the " two strategic partners " had discussed russian energy supplies to europe , terrorism , drugs trafficking , as well as iran and the middle east . they also agreed on starting to ease visa rules for certain categories of russians traveling to europe . resurgent russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oil well in northern russia near the barents sea export terminal of varandey russia is rapidly growing in wealth and diplomatic clout thanks to the enormous potential of its gas , coal and oil resources .
the country already supplies about half of eu gas needs and is the source or route for about a third of the 25-country bloc 's oil supplies . putin assured that " russia is a reliable partner " and that its resurgent power will be a force for good . " russia keeps raising its output of oil and increases its deliveries to the world market , " he said .
" it helps all the world economy , including the european economy , to grow normally and predictably . " he denied moscow might use eu dependency on russian fuel as a political lever , stressing that major new developments in the gas and oil industry involved both european and russian players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " rumors of europe losing its energy independence are highly exaggerated , " he said . putin said that russia 's rapidly growing economy " allows us favorable conditions for an independent foreign policy .
of course it 's like that . "
but , he added : " we do not intend to stick our noses in the air . " democracy concerns blair denied that the european union would soften its positions on russian democracy and human rights , particularly in chechnya , saying that such delicate questions were still on the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops sit atop an apc while patrolling in grozny , chechnya " for example we discussed the issue of chechnya earlier today , " he said .
" i do n't think the relationship is one of dependence , either on the russian side or the european side .
but what it is is a recognition of a very strong set of mutual interests . " silent treatment however , in the brief remarks to journalists no time was given to the many sour points in eu-russian relations , ranging from russian backing of iran 's nuclear program to the pro-west revolution in ukraine that saw the defeat of a moscow-backed candidate in last winter 's presidential election . on tuesday the eu imposed an arms embargo on the central asian , former soviet republic of uzbekistan .
this was in response to the government 's refusal to accept an international enquiry into the suppression this may of an uprising in the eastern town of andijan . however , moscow remains a steady ally of the uzbek government and has never backed an international probe . neither was there mention of the corruption and political interference that many experts believe prevent russia from attracting greater foreign investment - and thereby transforming the still relatively small economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

hundreds of usaf c-47 's , nicknamed rosinenbomber or " raisin bombers " by the local population , flew food and supplies into west berlin , sustaining residents for an 11-month period , and saving the city from a soviet takeover . generations of gis stationed in europe made their first contact with the continent at the frankfurt base , where huge letters spelling out " gateway to europe " decorate the side of a building .
one of the most famous gis to make the journey was rock legend elvis presley . jazz and hamburgers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley brought rock star glamor to germany during his time as a gi while the " amis " may not have always been loved by the local population , they certainly left their mark on the region .

after all , they brought jazz , chewing gum and hamburgers to a depressed postwar germany . it 's not without a little wistfulness , then , that frankfurt bids goodbye to the base , says frankfurt mayor petra roth . " the base was part of frankfurt life for 60 years , and that 's reflected in the close ties between the city and the us , " she said .
on the other hand , roth said , relinquishing the base offers " immense opportunities " for the development of frankfurt airport , which plans to build a third terminal on the site , to be completed by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops to head home in us military cuts us defense secretary donald rumsfeld revealed major military cuts across the united states on friday which would be offset by returning troops from german bases and other european deployments .

britain currently holds the shared eu presidency . anthony brenton , the british ambassador in moscow , told journalists that energy would be one of the main themes . " russia is a huge and expanding energy exporter and western europe is a large and expanding energy importer , " he said .
but work is needed in " removing glitches in our scope for energy cooperation . " big supplier about half the gas and one-third of the oil used in the 25-country bloc already comes from or via russia .
according to the international energy agency , eu gas demand could rise by 50 percent in the next 15 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue is especially timely in britain , where north sea oil and gas resources are winding down .
next year , for the first time in three decades , the country is expected to become a net importer of gas . putin last week trumpeted rapid economic growth that analysts say has more to do with oil prices of around 65 dollars a barrel than any meaningful reforms .

the wwf study ranked plants across the eu 's 25 member states according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .
carbon dioxide , a byproduct which results from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil , gas and coal , is the primary component of greenhouse gases that trap the sun 's heat and cause the earth 's temperature to rise . german plants among worst offenders germany is home to five of the survey 's ten dirtiest plants - four of which are run by the country 's giant power company rwe .
rwe was labeled as the biggest co2 producer in the european power sector , according to the wwf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe ag utility company headquarters in essen , germany is one of europes ' biggest producers of co2 .
" german power plants are europe 's top ' climate-killers , " ' said wwf expert regine günther . " the summer of 2005 , with the floods , droughts and heat-waves is just a taste of what can happen if co2 emissions are not drastically reduced . energy providers need to stop playing politics and finally start taking protective measures . " the wwf ranking showed that rwe plants in frimmersdorf , weisweiler , neurath and niederraussen ranked second , sixth , seventh and tenth respectively . additionally , a plant in jänschwalde operated by the swedish power company vattenfall ranked fifth . of the dirtiest power plants , 27 out of the 30 are coal-powered facilities . energy sector target of renovation " the power sector is responsible for 37 percent of all man-made co2 , " said imogen zethoven , head of the wwf 's power campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf logo world wildlife fund " coal-fired power stations rank dirtiest , because they use the most co2-intense fuel .
to switch off global warming we have to replace them with cleaner alternatives , such as gas and renewables , " she said , referring to solar , wind and water power . over the next two decades , many of the " dirty thirty " are set to be decommissioned , noted the wwf , calling this a " historic window of opportunity to cut co2 pollution . " replacing the outdated facilities with new coal power stations would result in a 13.5 percent cut in their total co2 emissions by 2030 , it said .
likewise , a shift to gas would slash co2 emissions by 47.8 percent , while replacing them with renewable energy sources would result in a 73.4 percent cut .
europe just part of the equation under the kyoto protocol , industrial countries that have ratified the treaty are required to trim pollution of carbon gases by a deadline of 2012 as compared with a 1990 benchmark .
many scientists still feel however that this effort falls far short of what is needed to avoid a rapid change in climate which could lead to a major global environmental crisis . after all , the un plan does not include the world 's top polluter , the united states , or developing countries such as china and india , where fast economic growth is driving up emissions . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

last monday , the last giant transport plane took off from the base for charleston , south carolina , and this past friday , the last passenger plane moved remaining staff to the spangdahlem base in the eifel region , near cologne . the base officially closes on dec .
31 of this year , but closing ceremonies will be held on oct .
10 .
the farewell has been coming in stages , though , with us units being relocated to other bases since 1995 .
us aircraft have not had a permanent home at rhein-main for years .
the huge , noisy c-130 hercules transport planes were moved to the german base at ramstein and the f-16 fighter jets to aviano , italy . bildunterschrift : a usaf c-117 transport plane prepares to take off from the rhine-main air base . " the planes that you 've seen in recent years at the frankfurt airbase were essentially just passing through , " said wolfgang hofmann , spokesman for the us personnel . the rhein-main base was last a point of tactical importance during the us-led attack on iraq , when planes would take off on a daily basis to transport soldiers and equipment to the persian gulf . needs overhaul us and german authorities signed an agreement in 1999 to close rhein-main by the end of 2005 .
the us air force said it was shutting down the base because its infrastructure was in need of a complete overhaul , making it expensive to maintain .
in addition , frankfurt wanted to expand its airport , and needed the adjoining space occupied by the base .
the closure also comes amid a general shift in the stationing of american troops abroad , as the us decreases its presence in traditional strongholds such as germany , in order to create smaller , more flexible forces around the globe . making history past conflicts in which the base played a key role include the vietnam war , the first gulf war , the afghanistan conflict and the conflict in the former yugoslavia .
but it was shortly after world war two that the base became part of aviation history when it was the coordination point for the berlin airlift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western allied and german officials welcome the first arilift plane , an american c-54 , to land on the runway of the new tegel airport in the french sector of the city of berlin , germany , on nov .

the plane , arriving from frankfurt , is bringing twenty thousand pounds of cheese for the blockaded berlin population . .
that operation began in june 1948 , after soviet authorities halted all traffic by land and water to berlin .
hundreds of usaf c-47 's , nicknamed rosinenbomber or " raisin bombers " by the local population , flew food and supplies into west berlin , sustaining residents for an 11-month period , and saving the city from a soviet takeover . generations of gis stationed in europe made their first contact with the continent at the frankfurt base , where huge letters spelling out " gateway to europe " decorate the side of a building .
one of the most famous gis to make the journey was rock legend elvis presley . jazz and hamburgers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley brought rock star glamor to germany during his time as a gi while the " amis " may not have always been loved by the local population , they certainly left their mark on the region .
some germans credit the gis with making the federal state of hesse cool .
after all , they brought jazz , chewing gum and hamburgers to a depressed postwar germany . it 's not without a little wistfulness , then , that frankfurt bids goodbye to the base , says frankfurt mayor petra roth . " the base was part of frankfurt life for 60 years , and that 's reflected in the close ties between the city and the us , " she said .
on the other hand , roth said , relinquishing the base offers " immense opportunities " for the development of frankfurt airport , which plans to build a third terminal on the site , to be completed by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops to head home in us military cuts us defense secretary donald rumsfeld revealed major military cuts across the united states on friday which would be offset by returning troops from german bases and other european deployments .

" german chancellor gerhard schröder too welcomed the move . " with it the european union has fulfilled a promise that it made to turkey 40 years ago , " the chancellor said . british foreign secretary jack straw , who 's country currently heads holds the rotating eu presidency , too said the agreement was nothing short of historic . " we are all winners : europe , the existing -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik , right , with austrian ambassador to the eu gregor woschnagg the 11th-hour deal followed nerve-wracking marathon negotiations after austria demanded that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join . long road ahead despite the widespread relief in the european union , which is still in turmoil following the crushing blow it received four months ago when french and dutch voters rejected its planned constitution , observers are still playing down monday 's deal , warning that turkey 's eventual membership could take years . fischer said the negotiations " will last a long time , ten , 15 years , perhaps more . " under the terms of the eu offer to ankara , turkey can not hope to join the bloc before 2014 , and there is no absolute guarantee of membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " europe won today .
that is for me the key point , " fischer added . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed the official start of talks with turkey to join the european union , but warned that the country must win over the skeptical european public . " europe must learn more about turkey .
and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " barroso said in a statement released late monday . " hello europe " in turkey the mood was jubiliant on tuesday . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül reiterated past ankara statements that eu entry could bridge gaps between christians and muslims and help to halt islamic militancy . " this is a win-win situation and the world will also win , " gül said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish trader reads a newspaper with a headline that reads : " we stood firm and won " the turkish media was ecstatic tuesday at the outcome of the negotiations with the eu . " hello europe " was the headline splashed on the mass-selling daily hürriyet .
" twice in history , we 've turned back from the gates leading to vienna , " the paper wrote in reference to austria 's fierce resistance to turkey 's eu membership . " now we 're entering europe on the way to peace and cooperation , " the daily wrote , adding that turkey 's 42-year-old dream of finding a place a europe , was finally become reality . another turkish daily , milliyet spoke of " a new europe and a new turkey . "
the paper wrote that it was the first time that europe was sitting down at the same table with an islamic country and called it " a crucially important step " by the eu " to become a global power . " " turkey and the eu merge their destinies , civilizations embrace , " the daily sabah wrote , while vatan praised ankara 's hard bargaining with the headline : " we stood firm , we won . " the blue and red of the eu and turkish flags were the backdrop to most front pages , while a vatan cartoon depicted the gold stars of the eu flag sparkling on the skyline between two minarets . doubts persist over full membership but elsewhere in europe , doubts persisted in conservative quarters about the wisdom of giving a populous muslim-dominated country a formal date to open eu membership talks at a time when opinion polls show that many europeans are against full membership . former french president valery giscard d 'estaing attacked the move , claiming that if successful they would undermine the basic aim of the eu . he told the rtl radio station that " france used to have a grand project - the political union of europe " - but will now " no longer have a message to bear . " he added , " we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone .
that 's what i regret . " in germany , home to the largest turkish immigrant community in europe and where the conservatives led by angela merkel are supportive of austria 's stance to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership , some papers too struck a cautious tone . " with the fixation on full membership there is the risk of the eu being destroyed by over-stretching .
so who is being stubborn here ? " the center-right frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote . the conservative die welt said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel " spoke out loud what numerous europeans think , but are not allowed to say : full eu membership for turkey is nonsense until the fundamental questions of the eu 's purpose , size and finances have been clarified .

" german chancellor gerhard schröder too welcomed the move . " with it the european union has fulfilled a promise that it made to turkey 40 years ago , " the chancellor said . british foreign secretary jack straw , who 's country currently heads holds the rotating eu presidency , too said the agreement was nothing short of historic . " we are all winners : europe , the existing -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik , right , with austrian ambassador to the eu gregor woschnagg the 11th-hour deal followed nerve-wracking marathon negotiations after austria demanded that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join . long road ahead despite the widespread relief in the european union , which is still in turmoil following the crushing blow it received four months ago when french and dutch voters rejected its planned constitution , observers are still playing down monday 's deal , warning that turkey 's eventual membership could take years . fischer said the negotiations " will last a long time , ten , 15 years , perhaps more . " under the terms of the eu offer to ankara , turkey can not hope to join the bloc before 2014 , and there is no absolute guarantee of membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " europe won today .
that is for me the key point , " fischer added . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed the official start of talks with turkey to join the european union , but warned that the country must win over the skeptical european public . " europe must learn more about turkey .
and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " barroso said in a statement released late monday . " hello europe " in turkey the mood was jubiliant on tuesday . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül reiterated past ankara statements that eu entry could bridge gaps between christians and muslims and help to halt islamic militancy . " this is a win-win situation and the world will also win , " gül said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish trader reads a newspaper with a headline that reads : " we stood firm and won " the turkish media was ecstatic tuesday at the outcome of the negotiations with the eu .

" twice in history , we 've turned back from the gates leading to vienna , " the paper wrote in reference to austria 's fierce resistance to turkey 's eu membership .

" " turkey and the eu merge their destinies , civilizations embrace , " the daily sabah wrote , while vatan praised ankara 's hard bargaining with the headline : " we stood firm , we won . " the blue and red of the eu and turkish flags were the backdrop to most front pages , while a vatan cartoon depicted the gold stars of the eu flag sparkling on the skyline between two minarets . doubts persist over full membership but elsewhere in europe , doubts persisted in conservative quarters about the wisdom of giving a populous muslim-dominated country a formal date to open eu membership talks at a time when opinion polls show that many europeans are against full membership . former french president valery giscard d 'estaing attacked the move , claiming that if successful they would undermine the basic aim of the eu . he told the rtl radio station that " france used to have a grand project - the political union of europe " - but will now " no longer have a message to bear .

dw 's baha güngör heaves a big sigh of relief . monday was to have marked the official launch of landmark entry talks with turkey .
but as the day approached , it seemed more and more unlikely that the negotiations would go ahead as scheduled .
chief among the trouble-makers was austria , which insisted that talks with turkey could only begin if accession negotiations were also opened with croatia . but then , contrary to all expectations , a last-ditch deal was reached after two days of tense debate - salvaging , just in the nick of time , the eu 's reputation as a sturdy super-structure able to take the heat . strategic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-awaited start of turkey 's entry talks represents an historic step for the eu , and a key reinforcement of its security interests in a strategic region .
while turkey once guarded europe 's south-eastern border as a member of nato during the cold war era , it now occupies a key position within the middle east conflict belt . the ultimate aim of the talks is , inevitably , turkish accession , but entry is by no means in the bag .
it will be years before the decision is taken whether or not to allow a politically , economically and socially transformed turkey to join the eu as a full member .
for the time being , piling on the pressure is counterproductive - all it will do is fan the flames of anti-eu sentiment within this mainly muslim country . and the turkish population 's reservations about too hasty a move towards the eu are just as understandable as europe 's wariness of turkey .
the country is well aware it still has many obstacles to weather , and it will be years before its vast regional disparities can start to narrow .
it 's a problem europe has experienced itself - and nowhere more painfully than germany , a country that has been trying to breach the gap between east and west for the last 15 years , and paying a heavy cost in the process . eu compatibility but turkey will also have to prove it is eu-compatible when it comes to democracy , human rights , the armenian question and the kurdish conflict - which will include demonstrating belief in european values in its approach to problem-solving . sorting out cyprus is another challenge turkey faces , and will be a key test of its willingness to compromise . turkey will have to adopt 35 chapters of eu law , and that means every single eu member state has 35 veto opportunities , since every chapter has to be unanimously agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik austria 's shenanigans over the last few days are more than likely to be repeated by one country or another , sooner or later . the risk of failure is acute given that every member state will have to ratify turkey 's entry agreement , some of which by referendum . after its speedy intake of eight new eastern european countries last year , which it 's still belly-aching about , the eu now has another set of problems to deal with .

some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink . the beer festival to end all beer festivals was actually a day longer this year than in the past ; it ran until monday 's unity day holiday .
but despite the extra time to tipple , less beer was actually guzzled at this year 's boozy bash than in the past . the 172nd oktoberfest still saw a lot of beer flow down a lot of gullets .
some 6.1 million people descended on the tents set up in the bavarian capital munich to engage in an orgy of beer drinking , pretzel-munching and bratwurst-noshing .
that beat last year 's crowd of 5.9 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down the hatch and while the amount of food consumed also jumped - the number of cows slaughtered rose from 89 to 95 - the amount of the sudsy stuff imbibed fell .
about 6 million liters -lrb- 13 million pints -rrb- of beer were downed , but that is about 100,000 liters below 2004 levels . the unseasonably cool and often wet weather might have dampened the drinking spirit .
others said new regulations that called for the volume of music played - including the famous oom-pah bands - to be lowered before 6 p.m. could have played a role . " when the music volume is lower people tend to drink a bit less but instead eat more , " said gabriele weishäupel , head of the munich tourist office . police are happy about it , reporting a drop in the number of assaults at the festival , down 248 this year compared to 351 last year .
the overall number of criminal acts fell to 1,304 from 1,690 in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

britain currently holds the shared eu presidency . anthony brenton , the british ambassador in moscow , told journalists that energy would be one of the main themes . " russia is a huge and expanding energy exporter and western europe is a large and expanding energy importer , " he said .
but work is needed in " removing glitches in our scope for energy cooperation . " big supplier about half the gas and one-third of the oil used in the 25-country bloc already comes from or via russia .
according to the international energy agency , eu gas demand could rise by 50 percent in the next 15 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue is especially timely in britain , where north sea oil and gas resources are winding down .
next year , for the first time in three decades , the country is expected to become a net importer of gas . putin last week trumpeted rapid economic growth that analysts say has more to do with oil prices of around 65 dollars a barrel than any meaningful reforms .
russia is " among the leaders , " he claimed , noting that oil and gas reserves across russia " are bigger than we think .
these reserves are enough for us and future generations . " he denied monday that moscow wants to use energy sold to western europe as a way to apply political pressure .
the participation of western companies in building a gas pipeline under the baltic and of russian companies ' in distributing gas and electricity in europe " will help to create a very stable system , " he told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction on the torshok-tjumen gas pipeline in der russian region of yaroslav the geo-politically sensitive gas pipeline is to be built under the baltic sea to ship fuel directly to germany , bypassing much of eastern europe and recent eu members such as poland , where relations with moscow are more tense . however , officials on both sides are going out of their way to stress common points . ambassador brenton played down russia 's recent scuppering of an eu attempt to censure iran over its civilian nuclear activities , saying : " my feeling is that this was no more than a tactical divergence . " both sides " are firmly committed to preventing iran from getting nuclear weapons . " wto , visas and anti-terrorism meanwhile , the eu ambassador to moscow , marc franco , expressed support for russia 's entry into the world trade organization and for a relaxing of eu visa rules for russia . for students , bureaucrats , journalists and others needing to travel because of their occupation , " it will be much easier in the future to get multiple-entry and long-term visas , " he told journalists . another major item on the agenda - and the top item in wednesday 's britain-russia talks - will be cooperation in anti-terrorism policies , diplomats said . although london and moscow are talking up cooperation in this area , the kremlin remains infuriated by its failure to extradite akhmed zakayev , a leading chechen separatist representative given political asylum in britain . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .

the wwf study ranked plants across the eu 's 25 member states according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .
carbon dioxide , a byproduct which results from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil , gas and coal , is the primary component of greenhouse gases that trap the sun 's heat and cause the earth 's temperature to rise . german plants among worst offenders germany is home to five of the survey 's ten dirtiest plants - four of which are run by the country 's giant power company rwe .
rwe was labeled as the biggest co2 producer in the european power sector , according to the wwf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe ag utility company headquarters in essen , germany is one of europes ' biggest producers of co2 .
" german power plants are europe 's top ' climate-killers , " ' said wwf expert regine günther . " the summer of 2005 , with the floods , droughts and heat-waves is just a taste of what can happen if co2 emissions are not drastically reduced . energy providers need to stop playing politics and finally start taking protective measures . " the wwf ranking showed that rwe plants in frimmersdorf , weisweiler , neurath and niederraussen ranked second , sixth , seventh and tenth respectively . additionally , a plant in jänschwalde operated by the swedish power company vattenfall ranked fifth . of the dirtiest power plants , 27 out of the 30 are coal-powered facilities . energy sector target of renovation " the power sector is responsible for 37 percent of all man-made co2 , " said imogen zethoven , head of the wwf 's power campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf logo world wildlife fund " coal-fired power stations rank dirtiest , because they use the most co2-intense fuel .
to switch off global warming we have to replace them with cleaner alternatives , such as gas and renewables , " she said , referring to solar , wind and water power . over the next two decades , many of the " dirty thirty " are set to be decommissioned , noted the wwf , calling this a " historic window of opportunity to cut co2 pollution . " replacing the outdated facilities with new coal power stations would result in a 13.5 percent cut in their total co2 emissions by 2030 , it said .
likewise , a shift to gas would slash co2 emissions by 47.8 percent , while replacing them with renewable energy sources would result in a 73.4 percent cut .
europe just part of the equation under the kyoto protocol , industrial countries that have ratified the treaty are required to trim pollution of carbon gases by a deadline of 2012 as compared with a 1990 benchmark .
many scientists still feel however that this effort falls far short of what is needed to avoid a rapid change in climate which could lead to a major global environmental crisis . after all , the un plan does not include the world 's top polluter , the united states , or developing countries such as china and india , where fast economic growth is driving up emissions . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink . the beer festival to end all beer festivals was actually a day longer this year than in the past ; it ran until monday 's unity day holiday .
but despite the extra time to tipple , less beer was actually guzzled at this year 's boozy bash than in the past . the 172nd oktoberfest still saw a lot of beer flow down a lot of gullets .
some 6.1 million people descended on the tents set up in the bavarian capital munich to engage in an orgy of beer drinking , pretzel-munching and bratwurst-noshing .
that beat last year 's crowd of 5.9 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down the hatch and while the amount of food consumed also jumped - the number of cows slaughtered rose from 89 to 95 - the amount of the sudsy stuff imbibed fell .
about 6 million liters -lrb- 13 million pints -rrb- of beer were downed , but that is about 100,000 liters below 2004 levels . the unseasonably cool and often wet weather might have dampened the drinking spirit .
others said new regulations that called for the volume of music played - including the famous oom-pah bands - to be lowered before 6 p.m. could have played a role . " when the music volume is lower people tend to drink a bit less but instead eat more , " said gabriele weishäupel , head of the munich tourist office . police are happy about it , reporting a drop in the number of assaults at the festival , down 248 this year compared to 351 last year .
the overall number of criminal acts fell to 1,304 from 1,690 in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

the two armies had different traditions , different mentalities and different leadership styles .
the nva soldiers would have to go through a more difficult transition than the majority of east germans .
" on october 2nd , the -lrb- east german -rrb- soldiers went into their barracks in nva uniforms and on the next morning they came out in olive green nato colors , " remembered jörg schönbohm , who was at that time the head of the bundeswehr 's eastern command .
" the gdr flag was lowered , the flag of the federal republic raised .
the mood was subdued , marked by waiting , and by mistrust . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one time warsaw pact members .
in 1990 , the nva ceased to exist and became part of the bundeswehr , a nato member in an instant , the size of the bundeswehr increased by 90,000 soldiers .
not everyone in the former warsaw pact member wanted to see the immediate dissolution of the army but the government in bonn , the capital at that time , said there was no chance that two armies would stand side-by-side or that there would even be an nva department within the defense ministry .
east germany left marks on the nva fifty-thousand former east german soldiers decided that they had an opportunity to further their careers in the bundeswehr and signed on for two years .
there would be exceptions as to who could become bundeswehr soldiers .
almost all high-ranking officers were excluded from continuing their work in the military .
bildunterschrift : nva members on maneuver " the sed -lrb- the east germany coimmunist party -rrb- dictatorship has left its mark , " stressed then defense minister gerhard stoltenberg , pointing out that most generals and admirals had been members of the sed .
they would be unable to impart the bundeswehr 's motto of inner leadership and the citizen in uniform .
the highest officers had simply been molded by the sed .
" the command-giving tactic had to be replaced by the assignment-giving tactic . -lrb- ... -rrb-
this was something that most nva officers learned with great effort , " said gunnar digutsch , nva expert from the university of hanover .
not only were commissioned nva officers finding it difficult in the bundeswehr .
already after one year , three-quarters of those who resigned to serve their new army had quit .
the " army of unity " was sold to the public as a success , but it was mostly young recruits who had not yet been indoctrinated into the nva ideology , who mentally accepted unity .
the army as an example of dialogue the nva had to be completely made over .
military barracks were renovated or razed to the ground .
some 1.3 million small arms , ammunition and military machinery were sold , passed along to another country , or simply scrapped .
new units were created ; a mix of west german and east germans found themselves thrown together in companies , battalions and divisions .
recruits from eisenach -lrb- in the east -rrb- met those from koblenz -lrb- in the west -rrb- , and a dialogue was started at the most basic level .
" the bundeswehr was a kind of contact point for young people , " said digutsch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers laying a wreath in memory of all who were killed in wars yet , while young people were exchanging experiences at the bottom , those at the top faced large challenges , most of all the reduction of the army from 600,000 to 370,000 soldiers .
it was part of the peace dividend of reunification .
that meant uprooting soldiers and their families around germany in what were already turbulent times .
by the mid-90 's , the process was completed and many former nva soldiers , due to their long-time military experience , found employment with industrial companies .
future for young easterners fifteen years after the merger of the bundeswehr with the nva , the newest recruits from both halves of the country are less curious about just how much effort it took to remold the army .
of more interest is the fact that , like on the private labor market , soldiers are paid less in the east than in the west .
nevertheless , more and more young men and women from the east are joining the bundeswehr .
" we -lrb- the army -rrb- have a relative high amount of recruits coming from the east .
these ambitious young officers are of course involved in the missions abroad , " said digutsch .
" i am certain that of these young people , a few will make it up into the upper ranks .

from the former east germany , he also played a key role in the campaign to reconstruct dresden 's landmark frauenkirche , or church of our lady . born in 1943 in sosa , saxony , ludwig güttler says that october 3 , 1990 is a date he 'll never forget . " german unification was one of the most extraordinary and moving times of my life , " he said .
" it was as if a wound that had never stopped hurting finally began to heal . " success in east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig güttler has played a crucial role in the reconstruction effort in fact , güttler had been one of the lucky ones .
during east germany 's communist years , he was solo trumpeter at the händel festival orchestra in halle and the dresden philharmonic before going on to teach at the international music seminar in weimar and the carl maria von weber conservatory in dresden , where he was a professor until 1990 . even so , gaining permission to travel outside the confines of the gdr was a constant battle .
but by the time the berlin wall had fallen in 1989 , ludwig güttler was performing where and when he wanted .
he was recognized as a virtuoso of international stature and acclaimed around the world as a conductor , scholar , concert promoter and sponsor . unlike many others from the gdr , he went from strength to strength over the next 15 years , appearing as a soloist and conductor at major concert venues both at home and abroad . reclaiming an east german landmark not content with his illustrious career , he threw himself into the reconstruction of dresden 's frauenkirche , a project that cost over 100 million euros .
güttler 's appeals and fundraising activities proved invaluable . " nothing is impossible , " he said .
" the reconstruction of the frauenkirche has a crucial social significance - it was an overwhelming task in terms of building , but it also represented so much more than that . " the advantages of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again after dresden was destroyed in the allies ' fire-bombing in 1945 , the frauenkirche remained a ruin for decades .
the ruling communists were uninterested in its renovation , but it became a touchstone to east germany 's grass roots peace movement . then , after the collapse of the iron curtain , a lobby group came together that was committed to seeing the frauenkirche returned to its former glory - a development that would never have come to fruition in the gdr . despite his successful career , ludwig güttler worked tirelessly as its spokesman . " from the very start , i wanted music to remain my main priority , " he said .
" but at some point i put my work as a teacher on hold in order to devote myself to the reconstruction project . " bildunterschrift : güttler participated in charity concerts , such as this one on dec .
23 , 1993 , from the beginning but it was also his musical credentials that made his fundraising so effective .
ludwig güttler played many concerts on behalf of the frauenkirche .

" german chancellor gerhard schröder too welcomed the move . " with it the european union has fulfilled a promise that it made to turkey 40 years ago , " the chancellor said . british foreign secretary jack straw , who 's country currently heads holds the rotating eu presidency , too said the agreement was nothing short of historic . " we are all winners : europe , the existing -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , turkey and the international community , " he told an early-hours news conference in luxembourg , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik , right , with austrian ambassador to the eu gregor woschnagg the 11th-hour deal followed nerve-wracking marathon negotiations after austria demanded that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join . long road ahead despite the widespread relief in the european union , which is still in turmoil following the crushing blow it received four months ago when french and dutch voters rejected its planned constitution , observers are still playing down monday 's deal , warning that turkey 's eventual membership could take years . fischer said the negotiations " will last a long time , ten , 15 years , perhaps more . " under the terms of the eu offer to ankara , turkey can not hope to join the bloc before 2014 , and there is no absolute guarantee of membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " europe won today .
that is for me the key point , " fischer added . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed the official start of talks with turkey to join the european union , but warned that the country must win over the skeptical european public . " europe must learn more about turkey .
and turkey must win the hearts and minds of european citizens .
they are the ones who at the end of the day will decide about turkey 's membership , " barroso said in a statement released late monday . " hello europe " in turkey the mood was jubiliant on tuesday . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül reiterated past ankara statements that eu entry could bridge gaps between christians and muslims and help to halt islamic militancy . " this is a win-win situation and the world will also win , " gül said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish trader reads a newspaper with a headline that reads : " we stood firm and won " the turkish media was ecstatic tuesday at the outcome of the negotiations with the eu . " hello europe " was the headline splashed on the mass-selling daily hürriyet .
" twice in history , we 've turned back from the gates leading to vienna , " the paper wrote in reference to austria 's fierce resistance to turkey 's eu membership . " now we 're entering europe on the way to peace and cooperation , " the daily wrote , adding that turkey 's 42-year-old dream of finding a place a europe , was finally become reality . another turkish daily , milliyet spoke of " a new europe and a new turkey . "
the paper wrote that it was the first time that europe was sitting down at the same table with an islamic country and called it " a crucially important step " by the eu " to become a global power . " " turkey and the eu merge their destinies , civilizations embrace , " the daily sabah wrote , while vatan praised ankara 's hard bargaining with the headline : " we stood firm , we won . " the blue and red of the eu and turkish flags were the backdrop to most front pages , while a vatan cartoon depicted the gold stars of the eu flag sparkling on the skyline between two minarets . doubts persist over full membership but elsewhere in europe , doubts persisted in conservative quarters about the wisdom of giving a populous muslim-dominated country a formal date to open eu membership talks at a time when opinion polls show that many europeans are against full membership . former french president valery giscard d 'estaing attacked the move , claiming that if successful they would undermine the basic aim of the eu . he told the rtl radio station that " france used to have a grand project - the political union of europe " - but will now " no longer have a message to bear . " he added , " we have allowed two further enlargements which are obviously going to transform europe into a large free trade zone .
that 's what i regret . " in germany , home to the largest turkish immigrant community in europe and where the conservatives led by angela merkel are supportive of austria 's stance to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership , some papers too struck a cautious tone . " with the fixation on full membership there is the risk of the eu being destroyed by over-stretching .
so who is being stubborn here ? " the center-right frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote . the conservative die welt said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel " spoke out loud what numerous europeans think , but are not allowed to say : full eu membership for turkey is nonsense until the fundamental questions of the eu 's purpose , size and finances have been clarified .

the wwf study ranked plants across the eu 's 25 member states according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .
carbon dioxide , a byproduct which results from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil , gas and coal , is the primary component of greenhouse gases that trap the sun 's heat and cause the earth 's temperature to rise . german plants among worst offenders germany is home to five of the survey 's ten dirtiest plants - four of which are run by the country 's giant power company rwe .
rwe was labeled as the biggest co2 producer in the european power sector , according to the wwf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe ag utility company headquarters in essen , germany is one of europes ' biggest producers of co2 .
" german power plants are europe 's top ' climate-killers , " ' said wwf expert regine günther . " the summer of 2005 , with the floods , droughts and heat-waves is just a taste of what can happen if co2 emissions are not drastically reduced . energy providers need to stop playing politics and finally start taking protective measures . " the wwf ranking showed that rwe plants in frimmersdorf , weisweiler , neurath and niederraussen ranked second , sixth , seventh and tenth respectively . additionally , a plant in jänschwalde operated by the swedish power company vattenfall ranked fifth . of the dirtiest power plants , 27 out of the 30 are coal-powered facilities . energy sector target of renovation " the power sector is responsible for 37 percent of all man-made co2 , " said imogen zethoven , head of the wwf 's power campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf logo world wildlife fund " coal-fired power stations rank dirtiest , because they use the most co2-intense fuel .
to switch off global warming we have to replace them with cleaner alternatives , such as gas and renewables , " she said , referring to solar , wind and water power . over the next two decades , many of the " dirty thirty " are set to be decommissioned , noted the wwf , calling this a " historic window of opportunity to cut co2 pollution . " replacing the outdated facilities with new coal power stations would result in a 13.5 percent cut in their total co2 emissions by 2030 , it said .
likewise , a shift to gas would slash co2 emissions by 47.8 percent , while replacing them with renewable energy sources would result in a 73.4 percent cut .
europe just part of the equation under the kyoto protocol , industrial countries that have ratified the treaty are required to trim pollution of carbon gases by a deadline of 2012 as compared with a 1990 benchmark .
many scientists still feel however that this effort falls far short of what is needed to avoid a rapid change in climate which could lead to a major global environmental crisis . after all , the un plan does not include the world 's top polluter , the united states , or developing countries such as china and india , where fast economic growth is driving up emissions . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink . the beer festival to end all beer festivals was actually a day longer this year than in the past ; it ran until monday 's unity day holiday .
but despite the extra time to tipple , less beer was actually guzzled at this year 's boozy bash than in the past . the 172nd oktoberfest still saw a lot of beer flow down a lot of gullets .
some 6.1 million people descended on the tents set up in the bavarian capital munich to engage in an orgy of beer drinking , pretzel-munching and bratwurst-noshing .
that beat last year 's crowd of 5.9 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down the hatch and while the amount of food consumed also jumped - the number of cows slaughtered rose from 89 to 95 - the amount of the sudsy stuff imbibed fell .
about 6 million liters -lrb- 13 million pints -rrb- of beer were downed , but that is about 100,000 liters below 2004 levels . the unseasonably cool and often wet weather might have dampened the drinking spirit .
others said new regulations that called for the volume of music played - including the famous oom-pah bands - to be lowered before 6 p.m. could have played a role . " when the music volume is lower people tend to drink a bit less but instead eat more , " said gabriele weishäupel , head of the munich tourist office . police are happy about it , reporting a drop in the number of assaults at the festival , down 248 this year compared to 351 last year .
the overall number of criminal acts fell to 1,304 from 1,690 in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

the former manchester united and northern ireland player is being treated in the intensive care unit of london 's cromwell hospital .
best , 59 , was admitted with flu-like symptoms but became " seriously ill " and is being treated with antibiotics .
professor roger williams said best 's condition was not alcohol-related .
since a liver transplant in 2002 he has been more susceptible to infections .
professor williams , who has been responsible for best 's care since the transplant , said best was responding well to treatment since admission on saturday .
" he is serious but improving , with the emphasis on improving , " he said .
george best 's health march 2000 : severe liver damage diagnosed february 2001 : treated for pneumonia april 2001 : anti-alcohol pellets implanted into his stomach july 2002 : undergoes liver transplant november 2004 : routine operation to check on liver transplant october 2005 : treated for kidney infection in intensive care decline of the golden boy " the infection has caused him to be severely ill but he is certainly responding to treatment and we hope to move him out of intensive care in the next 24 hours . "
prof williams told bbc radio five live that the former footballer 's current illness was not " directly related " to his alcoholism , despite admitting concern at best 's failure to give up drinking .
but this notion has been disputed by the national kidney research fund .
a spokesman said best 's present condition " could well be the result of taking a combination of immunosuppressive drugs , drugs to curb his desire for alcohol , and possible alcoholic consumption " .
but he went on : " it is highly unlikely his kidney infection was caused solely by taking the drugs he was given to prevent him drinking . "
' very ill ' best 's agent phil hughes added that the star was " responding to treatment " , although he was " still very , very ill " .
" his kidneys are showing signs of improvements , " he said .
" after a few tests they decided that it was his kidneys that were infected and this was due to the medication he 's been taking for his liver .
" his function tests are showing improvements so we 're keeping our fingers crossed " .
leaving the hospital on monday , best 's son calum told waiting reporters : " he 's ok .
he 's stabilised . "
despite warnings that continuing to drink after the transplant could kill him , best failed to give up alcohol .
' quickie ' divorce in november 2004 , george best declared himself " fit and healthy " after undergoing a routine operation to check on his liver transplant .
earlier last year he was banned from driving for 20 months after pleading guilty to drink-driving .
his marriage to his former air hostess wife alex ended in a " quickie " divorce a few months later .
his transplant had prompted questions about whether alcoholics should get donor livers , and best 's doctor warned that continued drinking would be catastrophic .
best received the transplant at the private cromwell hospital , which specialises in liver disease and transplants .
he has visited the hospital several times since , either for check-ups or because of infection .

once you are inside , you forget about the city 's potholed roads , utterly rowdy traffic and in-your-face poverty .
instead , inorbit , the biggest shopping mall in india 's commercial city mumbai -lrb- bombay -rrb- , is buzzing with customers .
it is a rich man 's world too , with multi-screen cinemas , restaurants , games and branded shops - well out of the reach of many of the country 's one billion people .
but india 's middle-classes , widely travelled and with deep pockets , are flocking to malls .
" i prefer shopping in malls because i get nearly everything i need under one roof , " says sheela .
naina agrees .
" it 's fun to shop here .
it 's different .
it offers more variety than the high street . "
rapid growth india 's organised retail industry accounts for just 3 % of the country 's total retail sales , though it is poised to grow by 97 % per year in the next five years to a staggering $ 24bn .
we indians are not so shop savvy arun nanda , mahindra and mahindra fuelling this growth are india 's sprawling shopping malls , which are increasingly challenging high street stores , corner shops and village markets alike .
just five years ago , there were shopping arcades but no malls .
today there are nearly 100 big shopping malls in the country , more than half of them in delhi and mumbai alone .
and in two years there will be 360 malls across the country .
more than 20 are in various stages of development in delhi and mumbai .
foreign investors among them is india 's biggest shopping mall , ambi , which is being built in gurgaon , near delhi .
critics say the malls attract window-shoppers in need of a place to hang out spread over 3.2 million square feet , it is set to become a virtual town , where multi-screen cinemas , recreational facilities for adults and children , food courts and branded outlets will fill the space it will have exclusive showrooms of international brands , where , according to the developers , customers will have to shop by prior appointment .
" it 'll be like an integrated township , where you 'll get everything , " says har baksh of the developers ambience .

the man was detained at thornhill street , in the canton area of the city following a raid at 0600 bst on monday .
he was one of five people detained during raids on monday in south wales , the west midlands and london .
the home office confirmed on tuesday that the five were being held at the high-security long lartin prison in worcestershire .
' national security ' on monday , the home office said the man from cardiff , believed to be a foreign national , was facing deportation because his presence was " not conducive to the public good " .
a home office spokesman confirmed that " the immigration service detained five individuals in accordance with the home secretary 's powers to deport individuals whose presence in the uk is not conducive to the public good for reasons of national security " .
he added : " they will be held in secure prison service accommodation and we will not disclose their names . "
city councillor ramesh patel said he was shocked by the arrest .
" you never expect something like this to happen on your own doorstep , but if we look at it very carefully we are a capital city and at some point we are going to get targeted , " he said .
you just do n't imagine it 's going to happen - it 's always going to happen somewhere else and not on your doorstep neighbour liz coombes a south wales police spokesman said officers had supported the immigration service in the raid .
near neighbour michael hart told the bbc : " at 6 o 'clock this morning i looked out the window and there was a police van parked across the road .
" i looked to my right and there were two policeman guarding the lane , alongside my house .
" i thought there was trouble in the pub .
i got dressed , went out and said : ' what 's going on ? '
the policeman said : ' we ca n't tell you at the moment . " '
mr hart also described how he later saw two low-loaders take away cars belonging to the detained man .
another neighbour , liz coombes , said she found it " unbelievable " the detained man had been living in her street .
" you just do n't imagine it 's going to happen .
it 's always going to happen somewhere else and not on your doorstep .
it 's quite unbelievable really . "
monday 's detentions bring to 22 the number who have been detained across the uk since july under the immigration act 1971 as part of a crackdown on terrorists and their supporters in the wake of the 7 july suicide bombings in london .
the act gives powers to deport individuals and to detain them pending deportation .
a detailed search has taken place at the property and a car has been taken from the street for examination .

help the aged also wants money paid out since the new revaluation of homes to be paid back .
the controversial exercise , which has been postponed in england , was discussed in the assembly on tuesday as labour 's budget plans are debated .
council tax was under the spotlight as the opposition united to call for changes in the budget .
all the prices for the services like electricity and gas have gone up ... but my pension has not gone up by £ 30 maureen jenner , pensioner one of those affected by rebanding is pensioner maureen jenner , whose bungalow , above ferryside , carmarthenshire , went up from band e to f , which saw her monthly council tax bill rise from £ 107 to £ 131 .
" i was very angry when it went up , i found out about it on the internet , " said mrs jenner , a widow .
she added : " it 's disgraceful , it is a hardship .
what is happening is all the prices for the services like electricity and gas have gone up , the rates have gone up such a big amount , but my pension has not gone up by £ 30 .
" people are certainly having to economise in order to meet bills .
i have got a private pension but if you have n't you have to go cap-in-hand . "
' income poor ' mrs jenner , chair of the carmarthenshire older people 's partnership , said she knew many pensioners who did not want to feel " undignified " over their finances .
" if it was paid out of income then people would n't have to suffer any indignity .
you can be property rich but income poor . "
last week pensioner sylvia hardy , from exeter , was jailed for seven days for refusing to pay an increase in her council tax .
mrs jenner said she understood why some pensioners would rather go to jail than pay increases .
in 2003 every home in wales was revalued .
some 60 % stayed in the same band , 33 % moved up at least one and eight per cent moved down .
it was announced last month the revaluation exercise for england would be postponed until after the next general election .
sir michael lyons , professor of public policy at birmingham university , is reviewing the way english local authorities are funded .
the welsh rebanding has led to protests and mrs jenner joined a protest at the assembly in february .
the welsh local government association , which met in swansea on monday , called upon the treasury - not the assembly government - to provide greater transitional relief in wales to cap further band rises .

el salvador - already shaken by the eruption of its biggest volcano - was worst hit with at least 31 deaths .
the government has declared a state of emergency and is evacuating thousands amid warnings of further rains .
stan also left a trail of misery elsewhere , killing at least four people in guatemala and four in honduras .
the storm swept across mexico 's yucatan peninsula over the weekend , drenching central america with three days of solid rain .
" 60 % of the country is in danger of landslides , " el salvador 's president tony saca warned .
" the risk caused by this accumulation of water is worrying . "
the country 's director of the national emergency centre , mauricio ferrer , said some 300 communities had been flooded .
more than 8,500 people had been forced to flee their homes , and were being accommodated in 122 shelters , he added .
routes swamped officials said a landslide buried five members of the same family , including three children , in san marcos , south-east of the salvadorean capital , san salvador .
" they are trapped in the mud that drowned them , " sobbed ana ramos , aunt to the mother of the family .
rescue workers are racing to find landslide and flood victims eighteen people were said to have died in the villages of chaparral , ateos , and lourdes , west of san salvador .
emergency personnel were trying to reach stricken areas , but were hampered as landslides and swollen rivers cut off major routes .
meanwhile , officials are keeping watch on ilamatepec volcano , 65km -lrb- 40miles -rrb- west of the capital , after it erupted early on saturday , killing two people and forcing thousands to flee .
a state of emergency has also been declared in parts of guatemala , after dozens of communities were also stranded by floods .
" we are noticing a critical situation in the south where the rivers have overflowed their banks , " said disaster agency official hugo hernandez .
the victims included a pregnant woman , her son and nephew , who died when their house was flattened about 250km -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- west of guatemala city , officials said .
three children were reportedly among those killed in the floods and mudslides that hit honduras .

west , the 39-year-old son of actors timothy west and prunella scales , has starred in films including howards end , iris and persuasion , and the 2003 bbc drama cambridge spies .
but he remains best known for his classical roles in the theatre , including an award-winning hamlet at the royal shakespeare company , as well as an acknowledged flair for directing .
now west steps into the shoes of michael grandage , as artistic director of one of britain 's leading regional theatres .
" i believe in the crucible , we have the most exciting stage in england , " says west , who launches the new season playing benedick in shakespeare 's much ado about nothing .
west played double agent anthony blunt in cambridge spies " unlike many theatres , there is no proscenium , so the audience and the actors are in the same room - i think that is essential for any truly moving experience . "
" there is a very strong sense of civic pride about the theatre , " says west of the three-stage theatre complex , which includes the crucible , the lyceum and the studio .
it was n't always so .
when michael grandage took over the running of the theatre in 2000 , regional theatre was in the doldrums .
but a much-needed cash injection from the arts council in 2001 heralded a new era of confidence in regional theatre , spearheaded by bold artistic directors like grandage and jude kelly at the west yorkshire playhouse .
over the past five years , audience figures have increased 71 % for in-house productions , bringing stars of the calibre of kenneth branagh and joseph fiennes to sheffield .
regional theatres : best of the rest " i think the £ 12.5m that was found four years ago - that wiped out the crude deficits of many years of under-funding - has allowed theatres to think in longer terms , with slightly larger casts , " explains west .
" it has meant that artistic directors like my predecessor have been able to look at the future with some ambition and some scope . "
" let 's not pretend that we are swimming in pots of cash , " stresses west .
" we are looking at an increase of inflation for the next two years . "
" nobody is in it for the money , everybody is in it for the love .
but it 's a vibrant and exciting time . "
west believes both stars and theatre-goers see sheffield as " a very proper alternative to the mad and fickle , time-consuming and expensive , london theatre " .
" i have n't really been in the job long enough yet , but i suspect a sea-change is occurring in terms of how regional theatre is perceived in this country . "
" sheffield is a theatre that tries to offer something for everyone that lives in sheffield , but it is also a theatre that there are reasons to visit if you are coming from london as well . "
we ca n't be a high street theatre , we ca n't just be putting on west end revivals samuel west west 's opening season includes three new plays , a christmas revival of the 1968 burt bacharach musical promises , promises , and howard brenton 's epic romans in britain .
casting has yet to be finalised on many of the shows later in the season , but west - like his predecessor - will not shy away from celebrity casting .
west is keen to bring his father -lrb- r -rrb- to perform in sheffield next year " i have no problem with celebrity at all .
when you are looking for big names , it 's always a toss up whether you can get them in advance , or whether you are better getting them at the last minute . "
" it is essential to fit the actor to the part .
i 've made no secret of the fact that some of the recent star casting in the west end leaves me mildly depressed . "
" but i think the sort of people that will come to sheffield are the sort of people who want to play these parts - and play them in a theatre where they will get the highest artistic standards applied to the production , and a very attentive and intelligent audience . "
much ado about nothing runs until 5 november at the crucible theatre , sheffield .

west , the 39-year-old son of actors timothy west and prunella scales , has starred in films including howards end , iris and persuasion , and the 2003 bbc drama cambridge spies .
but he remains best known for his classical roles in the theatre , including an award-winning hamlet at the royal shakespeare company , as well as an acknowledged flair for directing .
now west steps into the shoes of michael grandage , as artistic director of one of britain 's leading regional theatres .
" i believe in the crucible , we have the most exciting stage in england , " says west , who launches the new season playing benedick in shakespeare 's much ado about nothing .
west played double agent anthony blunt in cambridge spies " unlike many theatres , there is no proscenium , so the audience and the actors are in the same room - i think that is essential for any truly moving experience . "

alex neil , convener of holyrood 's enterprise committee , said the current scheme fails trainees and employers .
the scottish national party msp wants more flexible traineeships , paying the minimum wage and covering older people .
a scottish executive spokesman said its modern apprenticeships scheme had helped tens of thousands of people .
but mr neil said the current apprentice system was too inflexible and did not provide trainees with the skills needed to plug gaps in the labour market .
the modern apprenticeship programme should be doing much more to give people the skills in which they can get a job alex neil msp enterprise committee convener he also said less than half the annual apprentice courses are completed .
mr neil , who will outline his proposals at a skills conference in st andrews on tuesday , said there was a need to lever greater employer investment in skills and a greater focus on individuals .
and he said this would require a move away from " an exclusively supply side drive approach " which focused on training companies and schemes .
apprenticeships should be offered to older people , especially middle-aged , long-term unemployed men , according to mr neil .
academic basis he told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " the modern apprenticeship programme should be doing much more to give people the skills in which they can get a job at the end of it .
" there are major skills shortages in the building trade , in oil and gas , in care homes and in a whole range of other sectors in scotland and yet they can not get the people with the skills . "
business has disputed the need for minimum wage and he said all trainees should be paid the minimum wage , a proposal that has already attracted criticism from employers .
chief executive of scottish engineering , peter hughes , dismissed the call for paying the minimum wage .
mr hughes said : " he 's also falling into the trap of thinking that modern apprenticeships are routes for kids who are not academically qualified .
" nothing could be further than the truth . "
but stephen boyd of the stuc welcomed the proposals .
he said : " too many young people are leaving trainee schemes to work in places like mcdonalds , which unfortunately receive higher levels of pay .
dropping out " the way to address this is quite simple , it 's for the quality of the training to be improved and the level of remuneration to be improved accordingly . "
the executive said the current scheme enabled young people to learn crucial skills , while helping to ensure that companies could recruit employees with the level of skills and training they needed .
but deputy minister for enterprise and lifelong learning , allan wilson , said while some young people were not interested , the scheme had a good success rate of 60 % .
we 've got all immigrants now working for us , who are people who wish to work jim mcphie mcphie 's craft bakers he said : " giving qualitative training can be a problem for some but most modern apprenticeships have encouraged young people to follow structured training routes , which are developed to industry standards and national qualifications .
" the vast majority of modern apprenticeships go on to very good job prospects . "
the minister also dismissed the need to broaden the age range of the scheme .
craig douglas dropped out of his apprenticeship with a refrigeration firm after he ended up doing deliveries .
he said : " the engineers that were meant to be training us up , they were n't getting paid , they were n't trained to teach new younger engineers , i felt as if i was coasting along . "

alex neil , convener of holyrood 's enterprise committee , said the current scheme fails trainees and employers .
the scottish national party msp wants more flexible traineeships , paying the minimum wage and covering older people .
a scottish executive spokesman said its modern apprenticeships scheme had helped tens of thousands of people .
but mr neil said the current apprentice system was too inflexible and did not provide trainees with the skills needed to plug gaps in the labour market .
the modern apprenticeship programme should be doing much more to give people the skills in which they can get a job alex neil msp enterprise committee convener he also said less than half the annual apprentice courses are completed .
mr neil , who will outline his proposals at a skills conference in st andrews on tuesday , said there was a need to lever greater employer investment in skills and a greater focus on individuals .
and he said this would require a move away from " an exclusively supply side drive approach " which focused on training companies and schemes .
apprenticeships should be offered to older people , especially middle-aged , long-term unemployed men , according to mr neil .
academic basis he told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " the modern apprenticeship programme should be doing much more to give people the skills in which they can get a job at the end of it .
" there are major skills shortages in the building trade , in oil and gas , in care homes and in a whole range of other sectors in scotland and yet they can not get the people with the skills . "
business has disputed the need for minimum wage and he said all trainees should be paid the minimum wage , a proposal that has already attracted criticism from employers .
chief executive of scottish engineering , peter hughes , dismissed the call for paying the minimum wage .
mr hughes said : " he 's also falling into the trap of thinking that modern apprenticeships are routes for kids who are not academically qualified .
" nothing could be further than the truth . "
but stephen boyd of the stuc welcomed the proposals .
he said : " too many young people are leaving trainee schemes to work in places like mcdonalds , which unfortunately receive higher levels of pay .
dropping out " the way to address this is quite simple , it 's for the quality of the training to be improved and the level of remuneration to be improved accordingly . "
the executive said the current scheme enabled young people to learn crucial skills , while helping to ensure that companies could recruit employees with the level of skills and training they needed .
but deputy minister for enterprise and lifelong learning , allan wilson , said while some young people were not interested , the scheme had a good success rate of 60 % .
we 've got all immigrants now working for us , who are people who wish to work jim mcphie mcphie 's craft bakers he said : " giving qualitative training can be a problem for some but most modern apprenticeships have encouraged young people to follow structured training routes , which are developed to industry standards and national qualifications .
" the vast majority of modern apprenticeships go on to very good job prospects . "
the minister also dismissed the need to broaden the age range of the scheme .

the modern apprenticeship programme should be doing much more to give people the skills in which they can get a job " alex neil msp enterprise committee convener he also said less than half the annual apprentice courses are completed .
mr neil , who will outline his proposals at a skills conference in st andrews on tuesday , said there was a need to lever greater employer investment in skills and a greater focus on individuals .
and he said this would require a move away from " an exclusively supply side drive approach " which focused on training companies and schemes .
apprenticeships should be offered to older people , especially middle-aged , long-term unemployed men , according to mr neil .
academic basis he told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " the modern apprenticeship programme should be doing much more to give people the skills in which they can get a job at the end of it .
" there are major skills shortages in the building trade , in oil and gas , in care homes and in a whole range of other sectors in scotland and yet they can not get the people with the skills . "
and he said all trainees should be paid the minimum wage , a proposal that has already attracted criticism from employers .
chief executive of scottish engineering , peter hughes , dismissed the call for paying the minimum wage .
mr hughes said : " he 's also falling into the trap of thinking that modern apprenticeships are routes for kids who are not academically qualified .
" nothing could be further than the truth . "
but stephen boyd of the stuc welcomed the proposals .
he said : " too many young people are leaving trainee schemes to work in places like mcdonalds , which unfortunately receive higher levels of pay .
dropping out " the way to address this is quite simple , it 's for the quality of the training to be improved and the level of remuneration to be improved accordingly . "
the executive said the current scheme enabled young people to learn crucial skills , while helping to ensure that companies could recruit employees with the level of skills and training they needed .
but deputy minister for enterprise and lifelong learning , allan wilson , said while some young people were not interested , the scheme had a good success rate of 60 % . "
we 've got all immigrants now working for us , who are people who wish to work " jim mcphie mcphie 's craft bakers he said : " giving qualitative training can be a problem for some but most modern apprenticeships have encouraged young people to follow structured training routes , which are developed to industry standards and national qualifications .
" the vast majority of modern apprenticeships go on to very good job prospects . "
the minister also dismissed the need to broaden the age range of the scheme .
craig douglas dropped out of his apprenticeship with a refrigeration firm after he ended up doing deliveries .
he said : " the engineers that were meant to be training us up , they were n't getting paid , they were n't trained to teach new younger engineers , i felt as if i was coasting along . "
jim mcphie , of mcphie 's craft bakers in glasgow , has given up on the scheme , claiming he has found that many scots not already in higher education did not want to work .
he said : " we 've got all immigrants now working for us , who are people who wish to work , wish to be trained and the difference is quite remarkable . "

he was much loved and admired for his appearances in the long-running series the two ronnies , with ronnie corbett , as prison inmate fletcher , in the series porridge , and as arkwright , the bumbling , stuttering , sex-obsessed shopkeeper in open all hours .
born in bedford in 1929 , barker went to school in oxford , became an architecture student and even toyed with the idea of becoming a bank manager , the archetypal middle-class profession he would later parody so effectively in his comic sketches .
however , he joined aylesbury repertory company in 1948 , while still in his teens , before taking to the west end stage at the invitation of sir peter hall , where he appeared in mourning becomes her in 1955 .
masterful wordplay he appeared in several more plays , and also broke into radio .
he was in 300 editions of the navy lark as a b johnson .
ronnie barker first worked with ronnie corbett in the frost report and frost on sunday , programmes for which he also wrote scripts .
in 1971 they teamed up for the first two ronnies .
barker was the inimitable fletcher in porridge in all , there were a dozen series .
at its peak , more than 17 million viewers watched what had become a national institution , and the show was also admired abroad .
the scripts relied on masterful wordplay and impeccable timing , and barker wrote many of them .
barker himself , however , was among many viewers who regarded his portrayal of fletcher in porridge as the best work he ever did .
the series ended in 1977 , and was followed by the less successful going straight , about fletcher 's return to civilian life .
open all hours , with david jason , which ran for several series , was the work which ronnie barker probably enjoyed most .
he also played - less successfully - a welsh photographer in the magnificent evans and , later , a short-sighted removal man in clarence .
comic chameleon he wrote three films without dialogue - a home of your own , futtocks end and the picnic .
ronnie barker won a number of awards .
in the late 1970s he was three times the british academy 's best light entertainment performer , and in 1975 he took the royal television society 's award for outstanding creative achievement .
in 2004 barker was honoured with a bafta tribute award and celebration evening for his contribution to comedy .
one of britain 's favourite comic talents barker was a man of contradictions .
he never liked sex or obscenity on television , but there was no shortage of frisky gags in the two ronnies .
equally convincing in an overall , uniform or frilly frock , one of comedy 's great chameleons was less happy when asked to walk on stage and play himself .
he was modest about his writing skills and often submitted his scripts under pseudonyms , in order for them to be judged on their own merits .
able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters , barker pronounced himself " completely boring " without a script .
and when he considered that his own scripts had begun to decline in quality , he left showbusiness in 1988 to open an antique shop near his oxfordshire home .
resisted as well as citing a decline in health for his reason for retiring , barker said he always felt he should quit while he was ahead , and he had no further ambitions .
he resisted all calls back from retirement , until he felt compelled to write a play for his actress daughter charlotte , in 1998 .
the play received poor notices , and barker 's name was only added to the bill at the behest of the director .
he finally gave in to public demand in 2002 , delighting millions of viewers with his first tv drama appearance in more than a decade , as winston churchill 's manservant , in the gathering storm .
three years before , he had enjoyed a two ronnies reunion night on bbc one .

he was much loved and admired for his appearances in the long-running series the two ronnies , with ronnie corbett , as prison inmate fletcher , in the series porridge , and as arkwright , the bumbling , stuttering , sex-obsessed shopkeeper in open all hours .
born in bedford in 1929 , barker went to school in oxford , became an architecture student and even toyed with the idea of becoming a bank manager , the archetypal middle-class profession he would later parody so effectively in his comic sketches .
however , he joined aylesbury repertory company in 1948 , while still in his teens , before taking to the west end stage at the invitation of sir peter hall , where he appeared in mourning becomes her in 1955 .
masterful wordplay he appeared in several more plays , and also broke into radio .
he was in 300 editions of the navy lark as a b johnson .
ronnie barker first worked with ronnie corbett in the frost report and frost on sunday , programmes for which he also wrote scripts .
in 1971 they teamed up for the first two ronnies .
barker was the inimitable fletcher in porridge in all , there were a dozen series .
at its peak , more than 17 million viewers watched what had become a national institution , and the show was also admired abroad .
the scripts relied on masterful wordplay and impeccable timing , and barker wrote many of them .
barker himself , however , was among many viewers who regarded his portrayal of fletcher in porridge as the best work he ever did .
the series ended in 1977 , and was followed by the less successful going straight , about fletcher 's return to civilian life .
open all hours , with david jason , which ran for several series , was the work which ronnie barker probably enjoyed most .
he also played - less successfully - a welsh photographer in the magnificent evans and , later , a short-sighted removal man in clarence .
comic chameleon he wrote three films without dialogue - a home of your own , futtocks end and the picnic .
ronnie barker won a number of awards .
in the late 1970s he was three times the british academy 's best light entertainment performer , and in 1975 he took the royal television society 's award for outstanding creative achievement .
in 2004 barker was honoured with a bafta tribute award and celebration evening for his contribution to comedy .
one of britain 's favourite comic talents barker was a man of contradictions .
he never liked sex or obscenity on television , but there was no shortage of frisky gags in the two ronnies .
equally convincing in an overall , uniform or frilly frock , one of comedy 's great chameleons was less happy when asked to walk on stage and play himself .
he was modest about his writing skills and often submitted his scripts under pseudonyms , in order for them to be judged on their own merits .
able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters , barker pronounced himself " completely boring " without a script .
and when he considered that his own scripts had begun to decline in quality , he left showbusiness in 1988 to open an antique shop near his oxfordshire home .
resisted as well as citing a decline in health for his reason for retiring , barker said he always felt he should quit while he was ahead , and he had no further ambitions .
he resisted all calls back from retirement , until he felt compelled to write a play for his actress daughter charlotte , in 1998 .
the play received poor notices , and barker 's name was only added to the bill at the behest of the director .
he finally gave in to public demand in 2002 , delighting millions of viewers with his first tv drama appearance in more than a decade , as winston churchill 's manservant , in the gathering storm .
three years before , he had enjoyed a two ronnies reunion night on bbc one .
barker joined corbett to introduce the best of their sketches , and the hardware shop " four candles - fork handles ! " set-piece was judged the most popular by a television audience of millions .
earlier this year the two actors once again reunited for the two ronnies sketchbook , for a six-week run that proved popular with audiences .
viewers rediscovered the pleasures of the duo 's tightly scripted routines , and proved that while corbett 's golfing jumpers had passed their sell by date , the pair 's impeccable delivery and the comic chemistry between them had a longer lasting appeal .

statistics show that tech-savvy criminals are starting to turn away from e-mailed viruses to webpages to snare their victims .
also , say security firms , criminals are using spyware to get hold of personal data they can sell or use themselves .
fake programs that pose as proper products or security updates are reported to be on the rise .
tactical shift monthly statistics on the threats facing web users are showing a steep decline in the traditional line up of malicious e-mail viruses .
before now many virus writers have used mass mailed messages that spread viruses by either tricking people into opening the message or by exploiting bugs in microsoft 's outlook program .
but as the creators of these malicious programs increasingly look for a financial return , they are turning to websites , worms and spyware programs to do the work .
" more and more malicious code is appearing in web traffic as opposed to e-mail , " said mark sunner , chief technology officer at messagelabs .
for instance , said mr sunner , many phishing attacks use fake websites to try to steal login details and personal information rather than just rely on people filling in fields on a fake mailed message .
while statistics on top net threats gathered by security firms sophos and kasperksy labs reveal a list dominated by e-mail worms , such as netsky and mytob , also starting to appear in large numbers are spyware programs .

willie walsh said he did not " see any requirement " for compulsory job cuts as ba tries to save £ 300m by 2008 .
" going forward we have the chance to slim down through natural attrition , " the ba chief executive told the bbc .
unions have expressed fears of huge job losses as ba contends with soaring fuel costs and moves its heathrow operations to the new terminal 5 in 2008 .
no job target " the focus will be on having the right numbers " willie walsh , ba chief executive but mr walsh said he would work closely with unions to ensure that the airline had the right number of staff to deliver a world class service .
" we have not put a target on any job numbers , " mr walsh said .
" terminal 5 will give us the opportunity to get greater efficiencies .

mr walsh started work as ba boss on monday after spending four months working alongside his predecessor sir rod eddington .
he was previously chief executive of irish carrier aer lingus .
business class ba is planning to spend about £ 300m on consolidating its existing heathrow operations at the new terminal 5 .
mr walsh has previously said the move would enable the airline to tackle existing working practices which were " completely irrelevant " to enhancing customer service and safety .
the carrier is to spend more than £ 100m on improving its facilities for business customers on long-haul flights , mr walsh added .
it plans to launch its new business-class seat , which will convert into a full flat bed , before the end of the year .

longannet power station in fife appears at number 17 on a list of the least efficient among the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide .
the report said that 27 of the 30 dirtiest power plants were coal-fired .
operator scottish power said the plant was well within eu and british guidelines for emissions .
the firm said that the continued use of coal-fired power was a legacy of the past .
this generation of coal-fired power station will come to an end in the next decade scottish power it said scottish power was the biggest generator and developer of wind energy in the uk .
a spokesman said : " this generation of coal-fired power station will come to an end in the next decade .
" in the meantime , the most effective thing to do is to build-up renewable energy sources and run our existing coal power stations as efficiently as possible . "
five of wwf 's " dirty 30 " power stations were in germany .
longannet was the highest placed uk plant .
what we 'd like to see is development of scotland 's massive renewables potential dr dan barlow wwf scotland head of policy for wwf scotland , dr dan barlow , told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that inefficient stations should be phased out .
he said : " what we 'd like to see is development of scotland 's massive renewables potential , scottish power are already investing in renewables and there 's much more that could be done to further that .
" and there are also options including gas which are much more efficient than coal and we 'd like to see those options being used as replacement mechanisms . "
dr barlow called on stricter limits to be set on the emission trading system which creates carbon dioxide quotas .
he added : " the system to date has quite high limits so it does n't act as a big enough incentive to drive people away from inefficient fossil fuelled power stations . "

he is physically and verbally aggressive , finds it difficult to understand what people are saying to him , and has problems managing his money .
the condition he is thought to have is estimated to affect one in 100 people , yet most people have never heard of it .
foetal alcohol spectrum disorder -lrb- fasd -rrb- is caused by mothers drinking alcohol when pregnant .
i 'd have a bottle of wine for breakfast , a bottle of wine at night tracey hayter it is thought that exposure to too much alcohol can damage the front of a developing baby 's brain .
resulting symptoms include learning difficulties , problems processing information , poor judgement , a lack of emotional control and an inability to control sexual impulses .
one form of fasd is known as foetal alcohol syndrome -lrb- fas -rrb- .
people with fas not only have behavioural problems , they also show signs of tell-tale physical characteristics , such as narrow eyes , a flattened philtrum -lrb- space below the nose -rrb- and a thin top lip .
it is caused by heavy drinking during pregnancy .
some medical experts believe that fas could affect one in 1,000 babies .
numbers unclear in britain , it is only the full version of the disorder which is officially recognised , and even then it is under-reported .
i 've pulled knives about and i 've been violent , but i 've not realised i 've done it chris shorten figures suggest there were 150 cases last year , out of approximately 675,000 live births , but the world health organisation estimates that there were between 470 and 880 .
now , experts think there could be 10 times this number with some form of fasd .
chris ' mother , tracey hayter , admits that she drank heavily while pregnant with him .
" i 'd have a bottle of wine for breakfast , a bottle of wine at night .
this was quite a common thing . "
government guidelines on safe drinking advise women either to stop drinking altogether when pregnant or to stick to just one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week .
tracey drank after chris ' father walked out chris has been having to deal with the knowledge that his disability was probably caused by something his mother did .
moreover , he has to live with his disability itself .
a 20-year-old with fas has the reading ability of a 16-year-old , the money management skills of an 11-year-old , the emotional maturity of a six-year-old , and an average iq of 80 .
when chris stays at his mum 's house trouble can often ensue .
chris explains : " i 've been in the house and i 've pulled knives about and i 've been violent , but i 've not realised i 've done it .
" but sometimes when the police turn up i 'll think ' oh i 've done it ' , but then sometimes it 's too late because then they take you to the station and go through all that , and then you end up more angry because you realised what it is you 've done . "
but until his condition is recognised , he is just another young man on the housing list , flitting between bed and breakfast placements where he finds it hard to keep to the house rules , crashing on friends ' sofas , or even breaking into cars just to have somewhere to lie down for the night .
challenging guidelines it has always been believed that fas and fasd can only be caused by heavy drinking in pregnancy , but there is an increasing body of opinion now stating that low to moderate drinking -lrb- as little as a couple of drinks twice a week -rrb- may be enough to harm an unborn child .
the only guaranteed safe message is to say that , if you can avoid it , do n't drink dr raja mukherjee dr raja mukherjee , a psychiatrist specialising in fasd at st george 's , university of london , says : " one or two units is ambiguous .
people do n't drink one to two units ; they drink more .
" how quickly can you drink one to two units ?
is it safe for everybody - big or small , different sizes of people , who we know metabolise alcohol in different ways ?
is it safe to say that for every single person out there , every single person that is pregnant , that they can drink that level ?
" i do n't agree .
i think the only guaranteed safe message is to say that , if you can avoid it , do n't drink . "
" do n't drink " is the message that pregnant women in the us and canada receive .
the current uk government guidelines were published in 1995 , but a report due in 2006 , commissioned by the department of health , is looking into whether there is enough evidence to suggest the advice should change .
chris and his mum , desperate to get him diagnosed so he can receive proper support , have now sought the advice of dr mukherjee .
the diagnosis he gives is astonishing , and both chris and tracey know that it will change the course of their lives .

he is physically and verbally aggressive , finds it difficult to understand what people are saying to him , and has problems managing his money .
the condition he is thought to have is estimated to affect one in 100 people , yet most people have never heard of it .
foetal alcohol spectrum disorder -lrb- fasd -rrb- is caused by mothers drinking alcohol when pregnant .
i 'd have a bottle of wine for breakfast , a bottle of wine at night tracey hayter it is thought that exposure to too much alcohol can damage the front of a developing baby 's brain .
resulting symptoms include learning difficulties , problems processing information , poor judgement , a lack of emotional control and an inability to control sexual impulses .
one form of fasd is known as foetal alcohol syndrome -lrb- fas -rrb- .
people with fas not only have behavioural problems , they also show signs of tell-tale physical characteristics , such as narrow eyes , a flattened philtrum -lrb- space below the nose -rrb- and a thin top lip .
it is caused by heavy drinking during pregnancy .
some medical experts believe that fas could affect one in 1,000 babies .
numbers unclear in britain , it is only the full version of the disorder which is officially recognised , and even then it is under-reported .
i 've pulled knives about and i 've been violent , but i 've not realised i 've done it chris shorten figures suggest there were 150 cases last year , out of approximately 675,000 live births , but the world health organisation estimates that there were between 470 and 880 .
now , experts think there could be 10 times this number with some form of fasd .
chris ' mother , tracey hayter , admits that she drank heavily while pregnant with him .
" i 'd have a bottle of wine for breakfast , a bottle of wine at night .
this was quite a common thing . "
government guidelines on safe drinking advise women either to stop drinking altogether when pregnant or to stick to just one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week .
tracey drank after chris ' father walked out chris has been having to deal with the knowledge that his disability was probably caused by something his mother did .
moreover , he has to live with his disability itself .
a 20-year-old with fas has the reading ability of a 16-year-old , the money management skills of an 11-year-old , the emotional maturity of a six-year-old , and an average iq of 80 .
when chris stays at his mum 's house trouble can often ensue .
chris explains : " i 've been in the house and i 've pulled knives about and i 've been violent , but i 've not realised i 've done it .
" but sometimes when the police turn up i 'll think ' oh i 've done it ' , but then sometimes it 's too late because then they take you to the station and go through all that , and then you end up more angry because you realised what it is you 've done . "
but until his condition is recognised , he is just another young man on the housing list , flitting between bed and breakfast placements where he finds it hard to keep to the house rules , crashing on friends ' sofas , or even breaking into cars just to have somewhere to lie down for the night .
challenging guidelines it has always been believed that fas and fasd can only be caused by heavy drinking in pregnancy , but there is an increasing body of opinion now stating that low to moderate drinking -lrb- as little as a couple of drinks twice a week -rrb- may be enough to harm an unborn child .
the only guaranteed safe message is to say that , if you can avoid it , do n't drink dr raja mukherjee dr raja mukherjee , a psychiatrist specialising in fasd at st george 's , university of london , says : " one or two units is ambiguous .
people do n't drink one to two units ; they drink more .
" how quickly can you drink one to two units ?
is it safe for everybody - big or small , different sizes of people , who we know metabolise alcohol in different ways ?
is it safe to say that for every single person out there , every single person that is pregnant , that they can drink that level ?
" i do n't agree .
i think the only guaranteed safe message is to say that , if you can avoid it , do n't drink . "
" do n't drink " is the message that pregnant women in the us and canada receive .
the current uk government guidelines were published in 1995 , but a report due in 2006 , commissioned by the department of health , is looking into whether there is enough evidence to suggest the advice should change .
chris and his mum , desperate to get him diagnosed so he can receive proper support , have now sought the advice of dr mukherjee .
the diagnosis he gives is astonishing , and both chris and tracey know that it will change the course of their lives .

longannet power station in fife appears at number 17 on a list of the least efficient among the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide .
the report said that 27 of the 30 dirtiest power plants were coal-fired .
operator scottish power said the plant was well within eu and british guidelines for emissions .
the firm said that the continued use of coal-fired power was a legacy of the past . "
this generation of coal-fired power station will come to an end in the next decade " scottish power it said scottish power was the biggest generator and developer of wind energy in the uk .
a spokesman said : " this generation of coal-fired power station will come to an end in the next decade .
" in the meantime , the most effective thing to do is to build-up renewable energy sources and run our existing coal power stations as efficiently as possible . "
five of wwf 's " dirty 30 " power stations were in germany .
longannet was the highest placed uk plant . "
what we 'd like to see is development of scotland 's massive renewables potential " dr dan barlow wwf scotland head of policy for wwf scotland , dr dan barlow , told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that inefficient stations should be phased out .
he said : " what we 'd like to see is development of scotland 's massive renewables potential , scottish power are already investing in renewables and there 's much more that could be done to further that .
" and there are also options including gas which are much more efficient than coal and we 'd like to see those options being used as replacement mechanisms . "
dr barlow called on stricter limits to be set on the emission trading system which creates carbon dioxide quotas .
he added : " the system to date has quite high limits so it does n't act as a big enough incentive to drive people away from inefficient fossil fuelled power stations . "
