" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .
" any other future compromise would have been considerably more expensive for germany , " christian democratic union finance expert steffen kampeter told reuters . over the seven-year budgetary period beginning in 2007 , germany will end up paying about .42 percent of its gross domestic product to brussels , an increase of .09 percent over 2004 .
britain , italy and france will also end up handing more to the eu . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de budget deal hints at changing power structure in europe the eu budget was saved by the bloc 's most powerful leaders .

" " they decorate their windows in red and blue , red for christmas and blue for hanukkah , " she said .
" we wanted to make use of the very rare occasion that the two festivals fall within the same week this year to show where they come from and how they have changed . " no historic co n n ectio n betwee n holidays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient jewish roots are all that connect hanukkah and christmas roots in the jewish history are the only connections christmas has with hanukkah - the eight-day festival of lights which begins on the 25th day of the hebrew month of kislev . to those who are strangers to the customs of hanukkah in berlin , where the holocaust reduced a jewish population of about 190,000 to 10,000 registered with the city 's jewish community , the exhibition recalls that it celebrates the defeat by the maccabees of the syrian antiochius iv in 165 bc and their recapture of jerusalem . the museum explains that every night one more of the eight candles in the menorah , a nine-arm candelabrum , should be lit from the one in the middle and that the prayer spoken at the same time celebrates the defeat of the powerful by the weak . moder n holiday mixi n g more visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa lights the menorah a portion of the exhibition , which spreads through six halls and contains some 700 objects , deals with how to overcome the so-called " december dilemma " and send out neutral , politically-correct seasonal greetings . there has been a measure of cultural cross-pollination between the holidays as school christmas pageants become winter musicals and wishes of " merry christmas " turn to " happy holidays , " friedlander said . " it has become quite common for jewish families to give their children presents over hanukkah because it is so close to christmas , " she told the afp news agency . products for a n y celebratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new yorker magazine 's " the night before hanukkah " perhaps as an echo of the commercialization of christmas , one room at the exhibition is devoted to the wealth of products on sale around the celebrations . " a real american-type market has developed around hanukkah , " friedlander said .
" apart from sweets and the menorah which one finds in all different guises , the real trend of the year is a stuffed toy of the warrior judah maccabee , which is perhaps becoming the equivalent of father christmas for jewish children . " she said she had noticed that new york 's many mixed jewish-catholic couples have begun to combine christmas and hanukkah traditions . " one finds christmas trees decorated with objects normally symbolizing hanukkah , like small menorahs , " he said . the weih n ukka exhibitio n ru n s u n til ja n .

germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .
" what i am dealing with is … common standards … and that is an area where there is consensus also from germany , " he said . tackli n g illegal immigratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes to deter illegal immigration in the face of the high numbers of migrants living illegally in the eu , lawful migration has to be eased and clear criteria for migration must be formulated , frattini added . " today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .
our aim must be to tackle this illegal immigration within a legal framework . " the eu 's efforts to counter illegal immigration has so far largely focused on strengthening border controls and procedures for expelling illegal migrants . frattini now wants rules that make it easier for low-skilled workers to enter the bloc , thus effectively deterring illegal work . one example the eu commissioner provided was that of the european agricultural sector , which usually faces demands for people willing to take on low-paid work . frattini said the eu should have a special system which would allow seasonal workers from outside the bloc to work in europe a number of months each year for four to five years .

" premiere now has an increased room for financial maneuver to further develop its choice of programs in all areas , " premiere announced on wednesday after the decision . but the channel headed by austrian georg kofler has no other genuine programming other than the bundesliga . even kofler admitted there was " no plan b , " although the group was quick to point out that it retained rights to show matches from the 2006 world cup finals that take place in germany and the champions league , europe 's top club competition , from 2006 until 2009 . but helmut thoma , the former head of the rtl media group , said premiere faced a struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere bet the farm on retaining the rights - and lost it all " the prospects of premiere have always gone hand-in-hand with the rights to soccer , " he told afp .
" it is going to be very hard to survive without soccer . " premiere only launched on the frankfurt stock market this year and its shares plunged more than 40 percent on wednesday in the wake of the decision . cable gets rights over premiere i n surprise move in a surprise decision , the dfl decided that live soccer in germany , one of europe 's top leagues , will be shown by arena , a consortium of two small cable tv operators that is in talks with the far bigger kabel deutschland . public broadcasters ard , zdf and dsf will show highlights . most german householders are connected to cable tv , which effectively means that soccer on television will become more widely accessible in germany . premiere , once part of the giant kirch media empire , built its success on soccer , modeling itself on france 's canal plus and the rupert murdoch-owned sky in britain . under the current system , nearly 3.4 million people pay premiere a minimum 20 euros -lrb- $ 23.7 -rrb- a month for the right to see bundesliga domestic matches and champions league games that the other channels are not allowed to broadcast . a n estimated 10 perce n t of subscribers may dump premiere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer premiere packages will be sold in the coming years , say analysts having lost the right to show live matches , many analysts are speculating that viewers will desert the channel .
some put the figure at around one third , while kofler believes it will be more like 10 percent . premiere had in fact made the most lucrative offer to the dfl in a bid to retain its rights - around 300 million euros a season , according to reports . but it made the crucial error of attempting to insist that the " sportschau " show , shown on state channel ard early on a saturday evening and the essential round-up for all football fans , be moved to a late night slot to give more time between the live games and the highlights . some observers believe that premiere was punished for its negotiating stance . " it was a bad negotiating technique , " said hypovereinsbank analyst peter-thilo hasler . new deal aims to " give the bu n desliga back to germa n y " many soccer fans were angry at the plan and the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d described it , tongue in cheek , as a " danger to national security . " " we are very happy to be able to give the bundesliga back to germany , " said bernard de roos , head of the winning unity consortium , which includes the ish and iesy operators with kabel deutschland expected to take a 50 percent share . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere loses live german soccer rights to cable group the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- has dropped longtime partner , pay-tv company premiere , as the provider of live bundesliga games and has ruled in favor of a consortium of cable television operators .

" premiere now has an increased room for financial maneuver to further develop its choice of programs in all areas , " premiere announced on wednesday after the decision . but the channel headed by austrian georg kofler has no other genuine programming other than the bundesliga . even kofler admitted there was " no plan b , " although the group was quick to point out that it retained rights to show matches from the 2006 world cup finals that take place in germany and the champions league , europe 's top club competition , from 2006 until 2009 . but helmut thoma , the former head of the rtl media group , said premiere faced a struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere bet the farm on retaining the rights - and lost it all " the prospects of premiere have always gone hand-in-hand with the rights to soccer , " he told afp .
" it is going to be very hard to survive without soccer . " premiere only launched on the frankfurt stock market this year and its shares plunged more than 40 percent on wednesday in the wake of the decision . cable gets rights over premiere i n surprise move in a surprise decision , the dfl decided that live soccer in germany , one of europe 's top leagues , will be shown by arena , a consortium of two small cable tv operators that is in talks with the far bigger kabel deutschland . public broadcasters ard , zdf and dsf will show highlights . most german householders are connected to cable tv , which effectively means that soccer on television will become more widely accessible in germany . premiere , once part of the giant kirch media empire , built its success on soccer , modeling itself on france 's canal plus and the rupert murdoch-owned sky in britain . under the current system , nearly 3.4 million people pay premiere a minimum 20 euros -lrb- $ 23.7 -rrb- a month for the right to see bundesliga domestic matches and champions league games that the other channels are not allowed to broadcast . a n estimated 10 perce n t of subscribers may dump premiere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer premiere packages will be sold in the coming years , say analysts having lost the right to show live matches , many analysts are speculating that viewers will desert the channel .
some put the figure at around one third , while kofler believes it will be more like 10 percent . premiere had in fact made the most lucrative offer to the dfl in a bid to retain its rights - around 300 million euros a season , according to reports . but it made the crucial error of attempting to insist that the " sportschau " show , shown on state channel ard early on a saturday evening and the essential round-up for all football fans , be moved to a late night slot to give more time between the live games and the highlights . some observers believe that premiere was punished for its negotiating stance . " it was a bad negotiating technique , " said hypovereinsbank analyst peter-thilo hasler . new deal aims to " give the bu n desliga back to germa n y " many soccer fans were angry at the plan and the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d described it , tongue in cheek , as a " danger to national security .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .

a recent survey shows that christmas trees are more essential to a good time than family . ahh … christmas .
the time of year when you welcome those far-flung relatives back into your life and forget the painful incidents of previous years such as your embarrassing uncle 's annual drunken rendition of " i saw mother kissing santa claus " while wearing comedy reindeer antlers . it 's the time when all that familial animosity can be forgotten and you and yours can congregate round the christmas tree to belt out hymns and carols in an attempt to do your bit for peace on earth . for some germans , however , that scenario is closer to hell on earth than goodwill to all .
according to a survey in germany 's focus magazine , the tree may feature in most people 's ideal christmas celebration but the relatives gathered around it , well , you can forget them ! family takes a back seat to the good ol ' ta n n e n baum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas with the dogs - but without the family the survey found that 75 percent of germans could not bear to be without their beloved tannenbaum at christmas but only 65 percent said that spending time with relatives was essential to enjoying the festive period . and 3 percent of the 1,014 people polled about attitudes to christmas gave a massive " bah , humbug ! " to the whole thing and said that they could do without christmas full stop . elsewhere in the poll , a materially obsessed 42 percent said christmas just would n't be christmas without presents , while 57 percent said that , after the tree , singing carols was the next most vital ingredient of a happy yuletide . help is at ha n d for forgetful carol e n thusiasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how does it go again ? "
that 57 percent will be happy to know that when it comes to that integral part of the celebrations , there should be no fear of looking stupid when the first few lines of " jingle bells " peters out in a muffled hum .
help is at hand for forgetful carol enthusiasts in the form of a free help line which provides song texts and musical notes on request . if the delivery service wo n't ease that festive mental blockage in time to save face , then be prepared to have doris grassmugg or one of her colleagues sing at you down the phone from their office in graz , austria . the company has around 12,000 songs available , so even the most obscure carol rendition stands a good chance of being saved . merry christmas , everyone ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich under the christmas tree shops selling souvenirs for soccer fans are doing good business in germany ahead of christmas and in the lead up to the 2006 world cup matches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.12.2005 no room for holocaust denial in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's memorial to the holocaust was opened in may this year german politicians swiftly condemned iran 's president when he called into question israel 's right to exist and said the holocaust was a myth .
their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .
delayed acknowledgement west germany was indeed slow to come to turns with its nazi past .
the nuremberg war crimes tribunal brought the horrors of hitler 's regime to light , despite the fact that many germans did n't want to talk about what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has come clean about the holocaust " people were ashamed .
people felt guilty and did n't want to deal with it publicly , " benz said .
but they did n't deny it . " west germany first made an effort during the student demonstrations in the late 1960s .
they were n't just protesting against the vietnam war , but also demanded that their parents speak openly about the nazi past . an unexpectedly passionate debate developed in west germany in the late 1970s , when " holocaust , " an american mini-series about a jewish family during the third reich , was aired on television .
people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine . " it affects the agitator who claims the jews prey on the german people , that they invented the holocaust for that purpose , that foreigners should all be thrown out and that the discussion should finally be over with , " benz said .
" he must be punished because he engages in incitement of the masses , because he slanders the memory of those murdered , because he slanders our fellow citizens . " austria imposes even tougher penalties for such offences . historian and holocaust-denier david irving , who was recently arrested there , faces up to 20 years in jail . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants un to censure iran over president 's remarks germany plans to ask the un security council to punish iran for remarks made by its president questioning the reality of the holocaust , a senior government official says in an interview to be published sunday .

their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .
delayed acknowledgement west germany was indeed slow to come to turns with its nazi past .
the nuremberg war crimes tribunal brought the horrors of hitler 's regime to light , despite the fact that many germans did n't want to talk about what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has come clean about the holocaust " people were ashamed .
people felt guilty and did n't want to deal with it publicly , " benz said .
but they did n't deny it . " west germany first made an effort during the student demonstrations in the late 1960s .
they were n't just protesting against the vietnam war , but also demanded that their parents speak openly about the nazi past . an unexpectedly passionate debate developed in west germany in the late 1970s , when " holocaust , " an american mini-series about a jewish family during the third reich , was aired on television .
people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine . " it affects the agitator who claims the jews prey on the german people , that they invented the holocaust for that purpose , that foreigners should all be thrown out and that the discussion should finally be over with , " benz said .
" he must be punished because he engages in incitement of the masses , because he slanders the memory of those murdered , because he slanders our fellow citizens . " austria imposes even tougher penalties for such offences . historian and holocaust-denier david irving , who was recently arrested there , faces up to 20 years in jail . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants un to censure iran over president 's remarks germany plans to ask the un security council to punish iran for remarks made by its president questioning the reality of the holocaust , a senior government official says in an interview to be published sunday .

their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .
delayed acknowledgement west germany was indeed slow to come to turns with its nazi past .
the nuremberg war crimes tribunal brought the horrors of hitler 's regime to light , despite the fact that many germans did n't want to talk about what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has come clean about the holocaust " people were ashamed .
people felt guilty and did n't want to deal with it publicly , " benz said .
but they did n't deny it . " west germany first made an effort during the student demonstrations in the late 1960s .
they were n't just protesting against the vietnam war , but also demanded that their parents speak openly about the nazi past . an unexpectedly passionate debate developed in west germany in the late 1970s , when " holocaust , " an american mini-series about a jewish family during the third reich , was aired on television .
people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine . " it affects the agitator who claims the jews prey on the german people , that they invented the holocaust for that purpose , that foreigners should all be thrown out and that the discussion should finally be over with , " benz said .
" he must be punished because he engages in incitement of the masses , because he slanders the memory of those murdered , because he slanders our fellow citizens . " austria imposes even tougher penalties for such offences . historian and holocaust-denier david irving , who was recently arrested there , faces up to 20 years in jail . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants un to censure iran over president 's remarks germany plans to ask the un security council to punish iran for remarks made by its president questioning the reality of the holocaust , a senior government official says in an interview to be published sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2005 eu budget deal costs germany more than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after lavish praise for her negotiating skills , merkel is now under fire praised as a dealmaker par excellence after engineering last week 's eu budget compromise , angela merkel has drawn the the opposition 's ire after it emerged that germany 's payments to brussels are set to increase . the annual check germany , already the european union 's biggest net-contributor before the newest deal , sends to finance the european union grew by another 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- as part of the delicate budget deal chancellor merkel brokered last week . " we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .
" any other future compromise would have been considerably more expensive for germany , " christian democratic union finance expert steffen kampeter told reuters . over the seven-year budgetary period beginning in 2007 , germany will end up paying about .42 percent of its gross domestic product to brussels , an increase of .09 percent over 2004 .
britain , italy and france will also end up handing more to the eu . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de budget deal hints at changing power structure in europe the eu budget was saved by the bloc 's most powerful leaders .

their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin .

people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2005 eu budget deal costs germany more than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after lavish praise for her negotiating skills , merkel is now under fire praised as a dealmaker par excellence after engineering last week 's eu budget compromise , angela merkel has drawn the the opposition 's ire after it emerged that germany 's payments to brussels are set to increase . the annual check germany , already the european union 's biggest net-contributor before the newest deal , sends to finance the european union grew by another 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- as part of the delicate budget deal chancellor merkel brokered last week . " we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.12.2005 opinion : germany 's afghan job still important , still dangerous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kabul , jung said 1,850 german peacekeepers would move north almost 2,000 german soldiers will move from kabul to northern afghanistan , leaving 500 in the capital , defense minister jung said on thursday .
though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .
but that has changed .
the suicide attacks present a much greater danger .
there 's no adequate protection from attackers prepared to sacrifice their lives .
even the " dingo " armored vehicles defense minister jung handed over to the troops ca n't change that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier dies when in a suicide attack near a nato vehicle in kabul the new kind of threat fuels the suspicion that those pulling the strings have changed .
while in the past former militia leaders and drug barons trying to defend their realms were considered responsible , the new wave of violence brings to mind the work of islamic terrorists .
their aim : putting an end to the process of democratization .
afghan politicians fear that their country could become a new battlefield of islamic terror .
ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .
without security there is no democracy . joachim hagen , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german isaf troops honor fallen soldier in a memorial service on tuesday , isaf soldiers in kabul paid tribute to a german peacekeeper killed in monday 's suicide attacks .

" " they decorate their windows in red and blue , red for christmas and blue for hanukkah , " she said .

" no historic co n n ectio n betwee n holidays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient jewish roots are all that connect hanukkah and christmas roots in the jewish history are the only connections christmas has with hanukkah - the eight-day festival of lights which begins on the 25th day of the hebrew month of kislev . to those who are strangers to the customs of hanukkah in berlin , where the holocaust reduced a jewish population of about 190,000 to 10,000 registered with the city 's jewish community , the exhibition recalls that it celebrates the defeat by the maccabees of the syrian antiochius iv in 165 bc and their recapture of jerusalem . the museum explains that every night one more of the eight candles in the menorah , a nine-arm candelabrum , should be lit from the one in the middle and that the prayer spoken at the same time celebrates the defeat of the powerful by the weak . moder n holiday mixi n g more visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa lights the menorah a portion of the exhibition , which spreads through six halls and contains some 700 objects , deals with how to overcome the so-called " december dilemma " and send out neutral , politically-correct seasonal greetings . there has been a measure of cultural cross-pollination between the holidays as school christmas pageants become winter musicals and wishes of " merry christmas " turn to " happy holidays , " friedlander said . " it has become quite common for jewish families to give their children presents over hanukkah because it is so close to christmas , " she told the afp news agency . products for a n y celebratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new yorker magazine 's " the night before hanukkah " perhaps as an echo of the commercialization of christmas , one room at the exhibition is devoted to the wealth of products on sale around the celebrations . " a real american-type market has developed around hanukkah , " friedlander said .
" apart from sweets and the menorah which one finds in all different guises , the real trend of the year is a stuffed toy of the warrior judah maccabee , which is perhaps becoming the equivalent of father christmas for jewish children . " she said she had noticed that new york 's many mixed jewish-catholic couples have begun to combine christmas and hanukkah traditions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2005 eu wants to attract highly-skilled migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants to make it easier for skilled workers to gain entry to the bloc the european commission wants special immigration rules to lure high-skilled workers from outside the bloc as well as measures to better fight the growing problem of illegal immigration . addressing a news conference in brussels , eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini underlined that the 25-nation european union will need more immigrants in future to offset the impact of graying populations across the bloc . according to eu statistics , the eu workforce will decline by 52 million between 2004 and 2050 .
germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .
" what i am dealing with is … common standards … and that is an area where there is consensus also from germany , " he said . tackli n g illegal immigratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes to deter illegal immigration in the face of the high numbers of migrants living illegally in the eu , lawful migration has to be eased and clear criteria for migration must be formulated , frattini added . " today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .
our aim must be to tackle this illegal immigration within a legal framework . " the eu 's efforts to counter illegal immigration has so far largely focused on strengthening border controls and procedures for expelling illegal migrants . frattini now wants rules that make it easier for low-skilled workers to enter the bloc , thus effectively deterring illegal work . one example the eu commissioner provided was that of the european agricultural sector , which usually faces demands for people willing to take on low-paid work . frattini said the eu should have a special system which would allow seasonal workers from outside the bloc to work in europe a number of months each year for four to five years .

" premiere now has an increased room for financial maneuver to further develop its choice of programs in all areas , " premiere announced on wednesday after the decision . but the channel headed by austrian georg kofler has no other genuine programming other than the bundesliga . even kofler admitted there was " no plan b , " although the group was quick to point out that it retained rights to show matches from the 2006 world cup finals that take place in germany and the champions league , europe 's top club competition , from 2006 until 2009 . but helmut thoma , the former head of the rtl media group , said premiere faced a struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere bet the farm on retaining the rights - and lost it all " the prospects of premiere have always gone hand-in-hand with the rights to soccer , " he told afp .
" it is going to be very hard to survive without soccer . " premiere only launched on the frankfurt stock market this year and its shares plunged more than 40 percent on wednesday in the wake of the decision . cable gets rights over premiere i n surprise move in a surprise decision , the dfl decided that live soccer in germany , one of europe 's top leagues , will be shown by arena , a consortium of two small cable tv operators that is in talks with the far bigger kabel deutschland . public broadcasters ard , zdf and dsf will show highlights . most german householders are connected to cable tv , which effectively means that soccer on television will become more widely accessible in germany . premiere , once part of the giant kirch media empire , built its success on soccer , modeling itself on france 's canal plus and the rupert murdoch-owned sky in britain . under the current system , nearly 3.4 million people pay premiere a minimum 20 euros -lrb- $ 23.7 -rrb- a month for the right to see bundesliga domestic matches and champions league games that the other channels are not allowed to broadcast . a n estimated 10 perce n t of subscribers may dump premiere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer premiere packages will be sold in the coming years , say analysts having lost the right to show live matches , many analysts are speculating that viewers will desert the channel .
some put the figure at around one third , while kofler believes it will be more like 10 percent . premiere had in fact made the most lucrative offer to the dfl in a bid to retain its rights - around 300 million euros a season , according to reports . but it made the crucial error of attempting to insist that the " sportschau " show , shown on state channel ard early on a saturday evening and the essential round-up for all football fans , be moved to a late night slot to give more time between the live games and the highlights . some observers believe that premiere was punished for its negotiating stance . " it was a bad negotiating technique , " said hypovereinsbank analyst peter-thilo hasler . new deal aims to " give the bu n desliga back to germa n y " many soccer fans were angry at the plan and the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d described it , tongue in cheek , as a " danger to national security . " " we are very happy to be able to give the bundesliga back to germany , " said bernard de roos , head of the winning unity consortium , which includes the ish and iesy operators with kabel deutschland expected to take a 50 percent share . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere loses live german soccer rights to cable group the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- has dropped longtime partner , pay-tv company premiere , as the provider of live bundesliga games and has ruled in favor of a consortium of cable television operators .

" microsoft leaves kroes with " n o alter n ative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to show the commission can not be ignored " i have given microsoft every opportunity to comply with its obligations , " said competition commissioner neelie kroes in a statement .
" however , i have been left with no alternative other than to proceed via the formal route to ensure microsoft 's compliance , " she added . the us company said the commission 's criticism were " unjustified " because it had submitted on time new documents it claimed that eu regulators and an independent trustee advising on the case had not even read . " we are fully committed to comply with the decision , " microsoft general counsel brad smith in a statement . " we 've shipped a new version of windows , we 've paid an historic fine , and we 've provided unprecedented access to microsoft technology to promote inter-operability with other industry players , " he added . tech gia n t massively fi n ed for abusi n g its positio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft manufactures the leading operation system in the industry the eu competition watchdog already fined the software group in march 2004 a record 497 million euros for abusing its dominant market position . it also called on microsoft to market a version of its windows operating system without bundling it with its software media player and to divulge information about its operating system needed by manufacturers of competing products . the eu 's second-highest court gave its backing in december 2004 to the commission order to implement remedies , which microsoft wanted suspended . " it is now one year since the court of first instance confirmed that microsoft had to comply with the remedies imposed by the march 2004 decision , " the commission spokesman for competition , jonathan todd , told journalists .
" the commission very much regrets that one year on microsoft has still failed to do so , " he added . the case continues to drag on as the commission looks into " informal complaints " against the group . further n o n -complia n ce could lead to higher daily fi n es if microsoft remains defiant , the commission could decide to increase the daily fine . " we would have preferred obviously that microsoft complied quickly as they indicated this time last year that they would , " todd said .
" i would like to stress that we expect of course microsoft to comply with the march 2004 decision and not with their own interpretation of the march 2004 decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's brad smith says the company has done enough but microsoft insisted it had done everything to satisfy the commission , which accused of making inconsistent demands . " we continue working quickly to meet the commission 's new and changing demands , " smith said .

germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .
" what i am dealing with is … common standards … and that is an area where there is consensus also from germany , " he said . tackli n g illegal immigratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes to deter illegal immigration in the face of the high numbers of migrants living illegally in the eu , lawful migration has to be eased and clear criteria for migration must be formulated , frattini added . " today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .
our aim must be to tackle this illegal immigration within a legal framework . " the eu 's efforts to counter illegal immigration has so far largely focused on strengthening border controls and procedures for expelling illegal migrants . frattini now wants rules that make it easier for low-skilled workers to enter the bloc , thus effectively deterring illegal work . one example the eu commissioner provided was that of the european agricultural sector , which usually faces demands for people willing to take on low-paid work . frattini said the eu should have a special system which would allow seasonal workers from outside the bloc to work in europe a number of months each year for four to five years .
that would discourage illegal entry or people overstaying their visa permits , he argued . luri n g the highly-skilled the european commission has also emphasized that it must make efforts to attract highly-skilled , talented workers from outside the eu who now prefer the us to europe . the eu commission estimates that by 2030 , europe will be facing a workforce shortfall of 20 million people . " we propose a speeded up application processes in order to encourage highly-talented people to come to europe to work here , " frattini said . in addition to make it easier for highly-skilled workers to gain entry to the eu , the proposals include the introduction of an eu work permit valid in all 25 member states as well as making it easier for non eu-workers holding jobs with european multinationals to travel and work in those companies ' european offices . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe gets tough on immigrant crisis the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .

their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .
delayed acknowledgement west germany was indeed slow to come to turns with its nazi past .
the nuremberg war crimes tribunal brought the horrors of hitler 's regime to light , despite the fact that many germans did n't want to talk about what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has come clean about the holocaust " people were ashamed .
people felt guilty and did n't want to deal with it publicly , " benz said .
but they did n't deny it . " west germany first made an effort during the student demonstrations in the late 1960s .
they were n't just protesting against the vietnam war , but also demanded that their parents speak openly about the nazi past . an unexpectedly passionate debate developed in west germany in the late 1970s , when " holocaust , " an american mini-series about a jewish family during the third reich , was aired on television .
people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine . " it affects the agitator who claims the jews prey on the german people , that they invented the holocaust for that purpose , that foreigners should all be thrown out and that the discussion should finally be over with , " benz said .
" he must be punished because he engages in incitement of the masses , because he slanders the memory of those murdered , because he slanders our fellow citizens . " austria imposes even tougher penalties for such offences . historian and holocaust-denier david irving , who was recently arrested there , faces up to 20 years in jail . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants un to censure iran over president 's remarks germany plans to ask the un security council to punish iran for remarks made by its president questioning the reality of the holocaust , a senior government official says in an interview to be published sunday .

germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .
" what i am dealing with is … common standards … and that is an area where there is consensus also from germany , " he said . tackli n g illegal immigratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes to deter illegal immigration in the face of the high numbers of migrants living illegally in the eu , lawful migration has to be eased and clear criteria for migration must be formulated , frattini added . " today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .
our aim must be to tackle this illegal immigration within a legal framework . " the eu 's efforts to counter illegal immigration has so far largely focused on strengthening border controls and procedures for expelling illegal migrants . frattini now wants rules that make it easier for low-skilled workers to enter the bloc , thus effectively deterring illegal work . one example the eu commissioner provided was that of the european agricultural sector , which usually faces demands for people willing to take on low-paid work . frattini said the eu should have a special system which would allow seasonal workers from outside the bloc to work in europe a number of months each year for four to five years .

their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin .

people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine .

their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .

people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine . " it affects the agitator who claims the jews prey on the german people , that they invented the holocaust for that purpose , that foreigners should all be thrown out and that the discussion should finally be over with , " benz said .

" premiere now has an increased room for financial maneuver to further develop its choice of programs in all areas , " premiere announced on wednesday after the decision . but the channel headed by austrian georg kofler has no other genuine programming other than the bundesliga . even kofler admitted there was " no plan b , " although the group was quick to point out that it retained rights to show matches from the 2006 world cup finals that take place in germany and the champions league , europe 's top club competition , from 2006 until 2009 . but helmut thoma , the former head of the rtl media group , said premiere faced a struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere bet the farm on retaining the rights - and lost it all " the prospects of premiere have always gone hand-in-hand with the rights to soccer , " he told afp .
" it is going to be very hard to survive without soccer . " premiere only launched on the frankfurt stock market this year and its shares plunged more than 40 percent on wednesday in the wake of the decision . cable gets rights over premiere i n surprise move in a surprise decision , the dfl decided that live soccer in germany , one of europe 's top leagues , will be shown by arena , a consortium of two small cable tv operators that is in talks with the far bigger kabel deutschland . public broadcasters ard , zdf and dsf will show highlights . most german householders are connected to cable tv , which effectively means that soccer on television will become more widely accessible in germany . premiere , once part of the giant kirch media empire , built its success on soccer , modeling itself on france 's canal plus and the rupert murdoch-owned sky in britain . under the current system , nearly 3.4 million people pay premiere a minimum 20 euros -lrb- $ 23.7 -rrb- a month for the right to see bundesliga domestic matches and champions league games that the other channels are not allowed to broadcast . a n estimated 10 perce n t of subscribers may dump premiere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer premiere packages will be sold in the coming years , say analysts having lost the right to show live matches , many analysts are speculating that viewers will desert the channel .
some put the figure at around one third , while kofler believes it will be more like 10 percent . premiere had in fact made the most lucrative offer to the dfl in a bid to retain its rights - around 300 million euros a season , according to reports . but it made the crucial error of attempting to insist that the " sportschau " show , shown on state channel ard early on a saturday evening and the essential round-up for all football fans , be moved to a late night slot to give more time between the live games and the highlights . some observers believe that premiere was punished for its negotiating stance . " it was a bad negotiating technique , " said hypovereinsbank analyst peter-thilo hasler . new deal aims to " give the bu n desliga back to germa n y " many soccer fans were angry at the plan and the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d described it , tongue in cheek , as a " danger to national security . " " we are very happy to be able to give the bundesliga back to germany , " said bernard de roos , head of the winning unity consortium , which includes the ish and iesy operators with kabel deutschland expected to take a 50 percent share . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere loses live german soccer rights to cable group the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- has dropped longtime partner , pay-tv company premiere , as the provider of live bundesliga games and has ruled in favor of a consortium of cable television operators .

21 , 2005 -rrb- niche channels interrupt tv monotony digital tv and its expanded array of special interest programming can break up the relentless parade of folk music festivals and reality tv on german television .
but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on .
-lrb- march 31 , 2005 -rrb- german soccer not on the ball financially germany 's bundesliga may face a brighter economic future , says a new study .
but when it comes to making millions from tv rights , the top soccer league is languishing when compared to its european counterparts .

afghan politicians fear that their country could become a new battlefield of islamic terror .
ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden .

germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .
" what i am dealing with is … common standards … and that is an area where there is consensus also from germany , " he said . tackli n g illegal immigratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes to deter illegal immigration in the face of the high numbers of migrants living illegally in the eu , lawful migration has to be eased and clear criteria for migration must be formulated , frattini added . " today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .
our aim must be to tackle this illegal immigration within a legal framework . " the eu 's efforts to counter illegal immigration has so far largely focused on strengthening border controls and procedures for expelling illegal migrants . frattini now wants rules that make it easier for low-skilled workers to enter the bloc , thus effectively deterring illegal work . one example the eu commissioner provided was that of the european agricultural sector , which usually faces demands for people willing to take on low-paid work . frattini said the eu should have a special system which would allow seasonal workers from outside the bloc to work in europe a number of months each year for four to five years .
that would discourage illegal entry or people overstaying their visa permits , he argued . luri n g the highly-skilled the european commission has also emphasized that it must make efforts to attract highly-skilled , talented workers from outside the eu who now prefer the us to europe . the eu commission estimates that by 2030 , europe will be facing a workforce shortfall of 20 million people . " we propose a speeded up application processes in order to encourage highly-talented people to come to europe to work here , " frattini said . in addition to make it easier for highly-skilled workers to gain entry to the eu , the proposals include the introduction of an eu work permit valid in all 25 member states as well as making it easier for non eu-workers holding jobs with european multinationals to travel and work in those companies ' european offices . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe gets tough on immigrant crisis the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .

though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .
but that has changed .
the suicide attacks present a much greater danger .
there 's no adequate protection from attackers prepared to sacrifice their lives .
even the " dingo " armored vehicles defense minister jung handed over to the troops ca n't change that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier dies when in a suicide attack near a nato vehicle in kabul the new kind of threat fuels the suspicion that those pulling the strings have changed .
while in the past former militia leaders and drug barons trying to defend their realms were considered responsible , the new wave of violence brings to mind the work of islamic terrorists .
their aim : putting an end to the process of democratization .
afghan politicians fear that their country could become a new battlefield of islamic terror .
ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .

" " they decorate their windows in red and blue , red for christmas and blue for hanukkah , " she said .
" we wanted to make use of the very rare occasion that the two festivals fall within the same week this year to show where they come from and how they have changed . " no historic co n n ectio n betwee n holidays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient jewish roots are all that connect hanukkah and christmas roots in the jewish history are the only connections christmas has with hanukkah - the eight-day festival of lights which begins on the 25th day of the hebrew month of kislev . to those who are strangers to the customs of hanukkah in berlin , where the holocaust reduced a jewish population of about 190,000 to 10,000 registered with the city 's jewish community , the exhibition recalls that it celebrates the defeat by the maccabees of the syrian antiochius iv in 165 bc and their recapture of jerusalem . the museum explains that every night one more of the eight candles in the menorah , a nine-arm candelabrum , should be lit from the one in the middle and that the prayer spoken at the same time celebrates the defeat of the powerful by the weak . moder n holiday mixi n g more visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa lights the menorah a portion of the exhibition , which spreads through six halls and contains some 700 objects , deals with how to overcome the so-called " december dilemma " and send out neutral , politically-correct seasonal greetings . there has been a measure of cultural cross-pollination between the holidays as school christmas pageants become winter musicals and wishes of " merry christmas " turn to " happy holidays , " friedlander said . " it has become quite common for jewish families to give their children presents over hanukkah because it is so close to christmas , " she told the afp news agency . products for a n y celebratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new yorker magazine 's " the night before hanukkah " perhaps as an echo of the commercialization of christmas , one room at the exhibition is devoted to the wealth of products on sale around the celebrations . " a real american-type market has developed around hanukkah , " friedlander said .
" apart from sweets and the menorah which one finds in all different guises , the real trend of the year is a stuffed toy of the warrior judah maccabee , which is perhaps becoming the equivalent of father christmas for jewish children . " she said she had noticed that new york 's many mixed jewish-catholic couples have begun to combine christmas and hanukkah traditions .

" " they decorate their windows in red and blue , red for christmas and blue for hanukkah , " she said .
" we wanted to make use of the very rare occasion that the two festivals fall within the same week this year to show where they come from and how they have changed . " no historic co n n ectio n betwee n holidays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient jewish roots are all that connect hanukkah and christmas roots in the jewish history are the only connections christmas has with hanukkah - the eight-day festival of lights which begins on the 25th day of the hebrew month of kislev . to those who are strangers to the customs of hanukkah in berlin , where the holocaust reduced a jewish population of about 190,000 to 10,000 registered with the city 's jewish community , the exhibition recalls that it celebrates the defeat by the maccabees of the syrian antiochius iv in 165 bc and their recapture of jerusalem . the museum explains that every night one more of the eight candles in the menorah , a nine-arm candelabrum , should be lit from the one in the middle and that the prayer spoken at the same time celebrates the defeat of the powerful by the weak . moder n holiday mixi n g more visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa lights the menorah a portion of the exhibition , which spreads through six halls and contains some 700 objects , deals with how to overcome the so-called " december dilemma " and send out neutral , politically-correct seasonal greetings . there has been a measure of cultural cross-pollination between the holidays as school christmas pageants become winter musicals and wishes of " merry christmas " turn to " happy holidays , " friedlander said . " it has become quite common for jewish families to give their children presents over hanukkah because it is so close to christmas , " she told the afp news agency . products for a n y celebratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new yorker magazine 's " the night before hanukkah " perhaps as an echo of the commercialization of christmas , one room at the exhibition is devoted to the wealth of products on sale around the celebrations . " a real american-type market has developed around hanukkah , " friedlander said .
" apart from sweets and the menorah which one finds in all different guises , the real trend of the year is a stuffed toy of the warrior judah maccabee , which is perhaps becoming the equivalent of father christmas for jewish children . " she said she had noticed that new york 's many mixed jewish-catholic couples have begun to combine christmas and hanukkah traditions . " one finds christmas trees decorated with objects normally symbolizing hanukkah , like small menorahs , " he said . the weih n ukka exhibitio n ru n s u n til ja n .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .
" any other future compromise would have been considerably more expensive for germany , " christian democratic union finance expert steffen kampeter told reuters . over the seven-year budgetary period beginning in 2007 , germany will end up paying about .42 percent of its gross domestic product to brussels , an increase of .09 percent over 2004 .

their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .
delayed acknowledgement west germany was indeed slow to come to turns with its nazi past .
the nuremberg war crimes tribunal brought the horrors of hitler 's regime to light , despite the fact that many germans did n't want to talk about what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has come clean about the holocaust " people were ashamed .

but they did n't deny it . " west germany first made an effort during the student demonstrations in the late 1960s .
they were n't just protesting against the vietnam war , but also demanded that their parents speak openly about the nazi past . an unexpectedly passionate debate developed in west germany in the late 1970s , when " holocaust , " an american mini-series about a jewish family during the third reich , was aired on television .
people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine .

" if that does not happen , and two or three years from now we face the next problems , then i would be for making the rules mandatory , " he added . nearly all germany 's political parties called for ackermann to step down , at least until the case against him is closed , fearing germany could end up labeled as a socially irresponsible country that permits predatory business practices without regard for the nation 's employees . the judges made it clear " that no stock can be given to the immorality that has spread over top levels of business , " former social democratic party general secretary klaus uwe benneter told the n-tv news station . ackermann and five co-defendants are accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped 57 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- worth of golden handshakes after the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . dangers for german business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders fear court decisions could hinder innovation in germany but not everyone agrees that politicians should become overly involved in the business world . " politicians would be well advised to restrain themselves , " christian democratic union deputy chairman wolfgang bosbach said of the calls for ackermann 's resignation .
" this is an issue for the deutsche bank , the supervisory board and its chairman . " german business leaders added that the country stands to lose in a globalized world if courts are able to get involved in corporate decision making . " the judgment shows that we in germany have a backwards case-law , " jan pieter krahnen of center of financial studies in frankfurt told the berliner zeitung .
" it could mean a real set-back for the german economy 's power to compete . " ackermann has run deutsche bank according to an anglo-saxon model that puts investors ' concerns first in a country where the state and employees ' interests are normally given the most importance , according to krahnen . seen by many as a leader who was able to improve deutsche bank 's international position - and bottom line , the retrial decision could scare away foreign investors , afraid their success could be directly followed by lawsuits . during the trial , ackermann , who earned 11 million euros last year , said germany needed to " wake up " to the reality of bonuses , such as those paid to mannesmann executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers divided over mannesmann ruling european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2005 eu budget deal costs germany more than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after lavish praise for her negotiating skills , merkel is now under fire praised as a dealmaker par excellence after engineering last week 's eu budget compromise , angela merkel has drawn the the opposition 's ire after it emerged that germany 's payments to brussels are set to increase . the annual check germany , already the european union 's biggest net-contributor before the newest deal , sends to finance the european union grew by another 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- as part of the delicate budget deal chancellor merkel brokered last week . " we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .
" any other future compromise would have been considerably more expensive for germany , " christian democratic union finance expert steffen kampeter told reuters . over the seven-year budgetary period beginning in 2007 , germany will end up paying about .42 percent of its gross domestic product to brussels , an increase of .09 percent over 2004 .
britain , italy and france will also end up handing more to the eu . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de budget deal hints at changing power structure in europe the eu budget was saved by the bloc 's most powerful leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2005 eu budget deal costs germany more than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after lavish praise for her negotiating skills , merkel is now under fire praised as a dealmaker par excellence after engineering last week 's eu budget compromise , angela merkel has drawn the the opposition 's ire after it emerged that germany 's payments to brussels are set to increase . the annual check germany , already the european union 's biggest net-contributor before the newest deal , sends to finance the european union grew by another 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- as part of the delicate budget deal chancellor merkel brokered last week . " we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .

a recent survey shows that christmas trees are more essential to a good time than family . ahh … christmas .
the time of year when you welcome those far-flung relatives back into your life and forget the painful incidents of previous years such as your embarrassing uncle 's annual drunken rendition of " i saw mother kissing santa claus " while wearing comedy reindeer antlers . it 's the time when all that familial animosity can be forgotten and you and yours can congregate round the christmas tree to belt out hymns and carols in an attempt to do your bit for peace on earth . for some germans , however , that scenario is closer to hell on earth than goodwill to all .

nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .

defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .

" premiere now has an increased room for financial maneuver to further develop its choice of programs in all areas , " premiere announced on wednesday after the decision . but the channel headed by austrian georg kofler has no other genuine programming other than the bundesliga . even kofler admitted there was " no plan b , " although the group was quick to point out that it retained rights to show matches from the 2006 world cup finals that take place in germany and the champions league , europe 's top club competition , from 2006 until 2009 . but helmut thoma , the former head of the rtl media group , said premiere faced a struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere bet the farm on retaining the rights - and lost it all " the prospects of premiere have always gone hand-in-hand with the rights to soccer , " he told afp .
" it is going to be very hard to survive without soccer . " premiere only launched on the frankfurt stock market this year and its shares plunged more than 40 percent on wednesday in the wake of the decision . cable gets rights over premiere i n surprise move in a surprise decision , the dfl decided that live soccer in germany , one of europe 's top leagues , will be shown by arena , a consortium of two small cable tv operators that is in talks with the far bigger kabel deutschland . public broadcasters ard , zdf and dsf will show highlights . most german householders are connected to cable tv , which effectively means that soccer on television will become more widely accessible in germany . premiere , once part of the giant kirch media empire , built its success on soccer , modeling itself on france 's canal plus and the rupert murdoch-owned sky in britain . under the current system , nearly 3.4 million people pay premiere a minimum 20 euros -lrb- $ 23.7 -rrb- a month for the right to see bundesliga domestic matches and champions league games that the other channels are not allowed to broadcast . a n estimated 10 perce n t of subscribers may dump premiere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer premiere packages will be sold in the coming years , say analysts having lost the right to show live matches , many analysts are speculating that viewers will desert the channel .
some put the figure at around one third , while kofler believes it will be more like 10 percent . premiere had in fact made the most lucrative offer to the dfl in a bid to retain its rights - around 300 million euros a season , according to reports . but it made the crucial error of attempting to insist that the " sportschau " show , shown on state channel ard early on a saturday evening and the essential round-up for all football fans , be moved to a late night slot to give more time between the live games and the highlights . some observers believe that premiere was punished for its negotiating stance . " it was a bad negotiating technique , " said hypovereinsbank analyst peter-thilo hasler . new deal aims to " give the bu n desliga back to germa n y " many soccer fans were angry at the plan and the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d described it , tongue in cheek , as a " danger to national security . " " we are very happy to be able to give the bundesliga back to germany , " said bernard de roos , head of the winning unity consortium , which includes the ish and iesy operators with kabel deutschland expected to take a 50 percent share . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere loses live german soccer rights to cable group the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- has dropped longtime partner , pay-tv company premiere , as the provider of live bundesliga games and has ruled in favor of a consortium of cable television operators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2005 eu budget deal costs germany more than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after lavish praise for her negotiating skills , merkel is now under fire praised as a dealmaker par excellence after engineering last week 's eu budget compromise , angela merkel has drawn the the opposition 's ire after it emerged that germany 's payments to brussels are set to increase . the annual check germany , already the european union 's biggest net-contributor before the newest deal , sends to finance the european union grew by another 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- as part of the delicate budget deal chancellor merkel brokered last week . " we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .
" any other future compromise would have been considerably more expensive for germany , " christian democratic union finance expert steffen kampeter told reuters . over the seven-year budgetary period beginning in 2007 , germany will end up paying about .42 percent of its gross domestic product to brussels , an increase of .09 percent over 2004 .
britain , italy and france will also end up handing more to the eu . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de budget deal hints at changing power structure in europe the eu budget was saved by the bloc 's most powerful leaders .

" no historic co n n ectio n betwee n holidays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient jewish roots are all that connect hanukkah and christmas roots in the jewish history are the only connections christmas has with hanukkah - the eight-day festival of lights which begins on the 25th day of the hebrew month of kislev . to those who are strangers to the customs of hanukkah in berlin , where the holocaust reduced a jewish population of about 190,000 to 10,000 registered with the city 's jewish community , the exhibition recalls that it celebrates the defeat by the maccabees of the syrian antiochius iv in 165 bc and their recapture of jerusalem . the museum explains that every night one more of the eight candles in the menorah , a nine-arm candelabrum , should be lit from the one in the middle and that the prayer spoken at the same time celebrates the defeat of the powerful by the weak . moder n holiday mixi n g more visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa lights the menorah a portion of the exhibition , which spreads through six halls and contains some 700 objects , deals with how to overcome the so-called " december dilemma " and send out neutral , politically-correct seasonal greetings . there has been a measure of cultural cross-pollination between the holidays as school christmas pageants become winter musicals and wishes of " merry christmas " turn to " happy holidays , " friedlander said .

" a real american-type market has developed around hanukkah , " friedlander said .
" apart from sweets and the menorah which one finds in all different guises , the real trend of the year is a stuffed toy of the warrior judah maccabee , which is perhaps becoming the equivalent of father christmas for jewish children . " she said she had noticed that new york 's many mixed jewish-catholic couples have begun to combine christmas and hanukkah traditions .

germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .
" what i am dealing with is … common standards … and that is an area where there is consensus also from germany , " he said . tackli n g illegal immigratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes to deter illegal immigration in the face of the high numbers of migrants living illegally in the eu , lawful migration has to be eased and clear criteria for migration must be formulated , frattini added . " today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .
our aim must be to tackle this illegal immigration within a legal framework . " the eu 's efforts to counter illegal immigration has so far largely focused on strengthening border controls and procedures for expelling illegal migrants . frattini now wants rules that make it easier for low-skilled workers to enter the bloc , thus effectively deterring illegal work . one example the eu commissioner provided was that of the european agricultural sector , which usually faces demands for people willing to take on low-paid work . frattini said the eu should have a special system which would allow seasonal workers from outside the bloc to work in europe a number of months each year for four to five years .
that would discourage illegal entry or people overstaying their visa permits , he argued . luri n g the highly-skilled the european commission has also emphasized that it must make efforts to attract highly-skilled , talented workers from outside the eu who now prefer the us to europe . the eu commission estimates that by 2030 , europe will be facing a workforce shortfall of 20 million people . " we propose a speeded up application processes in order to encourage highly-talented people to come to europe to work here , " frattini said . in addition to make it easier for highly-skilled workers to gain entry to the eu , the proposals include the introduction of an eu work permit valid in all 25 member states as well as making it easier for non eu-workers holding jobs with european multinationals to travel and work in those companies ' european offices . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe gets tough on immigrant crisis the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .

" microsoft leaves kroes with " n o alter n ative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to show the commission can not be ignored " i have given microsoft every opportunity to comply with its obligations , " said competition commissioner neelie kroes in a statement .
" however , i have been left with no alternative other than to proceed via the formal route to ensure microsoft 's compliance , " she added . the us company said the commission 's criticism were " unjustified " because it had submitted on time new documents it claimed that eu regulators and an independent trustee advising on the case had not even read . " we are fully committed to comply with the decision , " microsoft general counsel brad smith in a statement . " we 've shipped a new version of windows , we 've paid an historic fine , and we 've provided unprecedented access to microsoft technology to promote inter-operability with other industry players , " he added . tech gia n t massively fi n ed for abusi n g its positio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft manufactures the leading operation system in the industry the eu competition watchdog already fined the software group in march 2004 a record 497 million euros for abusing its dominant market position . it also called on microsoft to market a version of its windows operating system without bundling it with its software media player and to divulge information about its operating system needed by manufacturers of competing products . the eu 's second-highest court gave its backing in december 2004 to the commission order to implement remedies , which microsoft wanted suspended . " it is now one year since the court of first instance confirmed that microsoft had to comply with the remedies imposed by the march 2004 decision , " the commission spokesman for competition , jonathan todd , told journalists .
" the commission very much regrets that one year on microsoft has still failed to do so , " he added . the case continues to drag on as the commission looks into " informal complaints " against the group . further n o n -complia n ce could lead to higher daily fi n es if microsoft remains defiant , the commission could decide to increase the daily fine . " we would have preferred obviously that microsoft complied quickly as they indicated this time last year that they would , " todd said .
" i would like to stress that we expect of course microsoft to comply with the march 2004 decision and not with their own interpretation of the march 2004 decision .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .
" any other future compromise would have been considerably more expensive for germany , " christian democratic union finance expert steffen kampeter told reuters . over the seven-year budgetary period beginning in 2007 , germany will end up paying about .42 percent of its gross domestic product to brussels , an increase of .09 percent over 2004 .
britain , italy and france will also end up handing more to the eu . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de budget deal hints at changing power structure in europe the eu budget was saved by the bloc 's most powerful leaders .

germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .
" what i am dealing with is … common standards … and that is an area where there is consensus also from germany , " he said . tackli n g illegal immigratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes to deter illegal immigration in the face of the high numbers of migrants living illegally in the eu , lawful migration has to be eased and clear criteria for migration must be formulated , frattini added . " today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .
our aim must be to tackle this illegal immigration within a legal framework . " the eu 's efforts to counter illegal immigration has so far largely focused on strengthening border controls and procedures for expelling illegal migrants . frattini now wants rules that make it easier for low-skilled workers to enter the bloc , thus effectively deterring illegal work . one example the eu commissioner provided was that of the european agricultural sector , which usually faces demands for people willing to take on low-paid work . frattini said the eu should have a special system which would allow seasonal workers from outside the bloc to work in europe a number of months each year for four to five years .
that would discourage illegal entry or people overstaying their visa permits , he argued . luri n g the highly-skilled the european commission has also emphasized that it must make efforts to attract highly-skilled , talented workers from outside the eu who now prefer the us to europe . the eu commission estimates that by 2030 , europe will be facing a workforce shortfall of 20 million people . " we propose a speeded up application processes in order to encourage highly-talented people to come to europe to work here , " frattini said . in addition to make it easier for highly-skilled workers to gain entry to the eu , the proposals include the introduction of an eu work permit valid in all 25 member states as well as making it easier for non eu-workers holding jobs with european multinationals to travel and work in those companies ' european offices . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe gets tough on immigrant crisis the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .

thierse suggested a set of rule to create a correlation between managers ' performance and the compensation they receive to ensure they work in their company 's best interest . politicians call for ackermann 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has to prove he was working in deutsche bank 's best interest thierse said he wanted to see whether business leaders would implement voluntary ethics guidelines after seeing the case 's results . " if that does not happen , and two or three years from now we face the next problems , then i would be for making the rules mandatory , " he added . nearly all germany 's political parties called for ackermann to step down , at least until the case against him is closed , fearing germany could end up labeled as a socially irresponsible country that permits predatory business practices without regard for the nation 's employees . the judges made it clear " that no stock can be given to the immorality that has spread over top levels of business , " former social democratic party general secretary klaus uwe benneter told the n-tv news station . ackermann and five co-defendants are accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped 57 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- worth of golden handshakes after the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . dangers for german business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders fear court decisions could hinder innovation in germany but not everyone agrees that politicians should become overly involved in the business world . " politicians would be well advised to restrain themselves , " christian democratic union deputy chairman wolfgang bosbach said of the calls for ackermann 's resignation .
" this is an issue for the deutsche bank , the supervisory board and its chairman . " german business leaders added that the country stands to lose in a globalized world if courts are able to get involved in corporate decision making . " the judgment shows that we in germany have a backwards case-law , " jan pieter krahnen of center of financial studies in frankfurt told the berliner zeitung .
" it could mean a real set-back for the german economy 's power to compete . " ackermann has run deutsche bank according to an anglo-saxon model that puts investors ' concerns first in a country where the state and employees ' interests are normally given the most importance , according to krahnen . seen by many as a leader who was able to improve deutsche bank 's international position - and bottom line , the retrial decision could scare away foreign investors , afraid their success could be directly followed by lawsuits . during the trial , ackermann , who earned 11 million euros last year , said germany needed to " wake up " to the reality of bonuses , such as those paid to mannesmann executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers divided over mannesmann ruling european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job .

though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .
but that has changed .
the suicide attacks present a much greater danger .
there 's no adequate protection from attackers prepared to sacrifice their lives .
even the " dingo " armored vehicles defense minister jung handed over to the troops ca n't change that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier dies when in a suicide attack near a nato vehicle in kabul the new kind of threat fuels the suspicion that those pulling the strings have changed .
while in the past former militia leaders and drug barons trying to defend their realms were considered responsible , the new wave of violence brings to mind the work of islamic terrorists .
their aim : putting an end to the process of democratization .
afghan politicians fear that their country could become a new battlefield of islamic terror .
ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .

" premiere now has an increased room for financial maneuver to further develop its choice of programs in all areas , " premiere announced on wednesday after the decision . but the channel headed by austrian georg kofler has no other genuine programming other than the bundesliga . even kofler admitted there was " no plan b , " although the group was quick to point out that it retained rights to show matches from the 2006 world cup finals that take place in germany and the champions league , europe 's top club competition , from 2006 until 2009 . but helmut thoma , the former head of the rtl media group , said premiere faced a struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere bet the farm on retaining the rights - and lost it all " the prospects of premiere have always gone hand-in-hand with the rights to soccer , " he told afp .
" it is going to be very hard to survive without soccer . " premiere only launched on the frankfurt stock market this year and its shares plunged more than 40 percent on wednesday in the wake of the decision . cable gets rights over premiere i n surprise move in a surprise decision , the dfl decided that live soccer in germany , one of europe 's top leagues , will be shown by arena , a consortium of two small cable tv operators that is in talks with the far bigger kabel deutschland . public broadcasters ard , zdf and dsf will show highlights . most german householders are connected to cable tv , which effectively means that soccer on television will become more widely accessible in germany . premiere , once part of the giant kirch media empire , built its success on soccer , modeling itself on france 's canal plus and the rupert murdoch-owned sky in britain . under the current system , nearly 3.4 million people pay premiere a minimum 20 euros -lrb- $ 23.7 -rrb- a month for the right to see bundesliga domestic matches and champions league games that the other channels are not allowed to broadcast . a n estimated 10 perce n t of subscribers may dump premiere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer premiere packages will be sold in the coming years , say analysts having lost the right to show live matches , many analysts are speculating that viewers will desert the channel .
some put the figure at around one third , while kofler believes it will be more like 10 percent . premiere had in fact made the most lucrative offer to the dfl in a bid to retain its rights - around 300 million euros a season , according to reports . but it made the crucial error of attempting to insist that the " sportschau " show , shown on state channel ard early on a saturday evening and the essential round-up for all football fans , be moved to a late night slot to give more time between the live games and the highlights . some observers believe that premiere was punished for its negotiating stance . " it was a bad negotiating technique , " said hypovereinsbank analyst peter-thilo hasler . new deal aims to " give the bu n desliga back to germa n y " many soccer fans were angry at the plan and the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d described it , tongue in cheek , as a " danger to national security . " " we are very happy to be able to give the bundesliga back to germany , " said bernard de roos , head of the winning unity consortium , which includes the ish and iesy operators with kabel deutschland expected to take a 50 percent share . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere loses live german soccer rights to cable group the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- has dropped longtime partner , pay-tv company premiere , as the provider of live bundesliga games and has ruled in favor of a consortium of cable television operators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.12.2005 opinion : germany 's afghan job still important , still dangerous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kabul , jung said 1,850 german peacekeepers would move north almost 2,000 german soldiers will move from kabul to northern afghanistan , leaving 500 in the capital , defense minister jung said on thursday .
though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .
but that has changed .
the suicide attacks present a much greater danger .
there 's no adequate protection from attackers prepared to sacrifice their lives .
even the " dingo " armored vehicles defense minister jung handed over to the troops ca n't change that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier dies when in a suicide attack near a nato vehicle in kabul the new kind of threat fuels the suspicion that those pulling the strings have changed .
while in the past former militia leaders and drug barons trying to defend their realms were considered responsible , the new wave of violence brings to mind the work of islamic terrorists .
their aim : putting an end to the process of democratization .
afghan politicians fear that their country could become a new battlefield of islamic terror .
ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .
without security there is no democracy . joachim hagen , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german isaf troops honor fallen soldier in a memorial service on tuesday , isaf soldiers in kabul paid tribute to a german peacekeeper killed in monday 's suicide attacks .

though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .
but that has changed .
the suicide attacks present a much greater danger .
there 's no adequate protection from attackers prepared to sacrifice their lives .
even the " dingo " armored vehicles defense minister jung handed over to the troops ca n't change that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier dies when in a suicide attack near a nato vehicle in kabul the new kind of threat fuels the suspicion that those pulling the strings have changed .
while in the past former militia leaders and drug barons trying to defend their realms were considered responsible , the new wave of violence brings to mind the work of islamic terrorists .
their aim : putting an end to the process of democratization .
afghan politicians fear that their country could become a new battlefield of islamic terror .
ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .
without security there is no democracy . joachim hagen , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german isaf troops honor fallen soldier in a memorial service on tuesday , isaf soldiers in kabul paid tribute to a german peacekeeper killed in monday 's suicide attacks .

nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .

at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .

ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .

defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .

though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .
but that has changed .
the suicide attacks present a much greater danger .
there 's no adequate protection from attackers prepared to sacrifice their lives .
even the " dingo " armored vehicles defense minister jung handed over to the troops ca n't change that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier dies when in a suicide attack near a nato vehicle in kabul the new kind of threat fuels the suspicion that those pulling the strings have changed .

germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .
" what i am dealing with is … common standards … and that is an area where there is consensus also from germany , " he said . tackli n g illegal immigratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes to deter illegal immigration in the face of the high numbers of migrants living illegally in the eu , lawful migration has to be eased and clear criteria for migration must be formulated , frattini added . " today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .

their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .
delayed acknowledgement west germany was indeed slow to come to turns with its nazi past .
the nuremberg war crimes tribunal brought the horrors of hitler 's regime to light , despite the fact that many germans did n't want to talk about what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has come clean about the holocaust " people were ashamed .
people felt guilty and did n't want to deal with it publicly , " benz said .
but they did n't deny it . " west germany first made an effort during the student demonstrations in the late 1960s .
they were n't just protesting against the vietnam war , but also demanded that their parents speak openly about the nazi past . an unexpectedly passionate debate developed in west germany in the late 1970s , when " holocaust , " an american mini-series about a jewish family during the third reich , was aired on television .
people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine . " it affects the agitator who claims the jews prey on the german people , that they invented the holocaust for that purpose , that foreigners should all be thrown out and that the discussion should finally be over with , " benz said .
" he must be punished because he engages in incitement of the masses , because he slanders the memory of those murdered , because he slanders our fellow citizens . " austria imposes even tougher penalties for such offences . historian and holocaust-denier david irving , who was recently arrested there , faces up to 20 years in jail . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants un to censure iran over president 's remarks germany plans to ask the un security council to punish iran for remarks made by its president questioning the reality of the holocaust , a senior government official says in an interview to be published sunday .

" " they decorate their windows in red and blue , red for christmas and blue for hanukkah , " she said .
" we wanted to make use of the very rare occasion that the two festivals fall within the same week this year to show where they come from and how they have changed . " no historic co n n ectio n betwee n holidays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient jewish roots are all that connect hanukkah and christmas roots in the jewish history are the only connections christmas has with hanukkah - the eight-day festival of lights which begins on the 25th day of the hebrew month of kislev . to those who are strangers to the customs of hanukkah in berlin , where the holocaust reduced a jewish population of about 190,000 to 10,000 registered with the city 's jewish community , the exhibition recalls that it celebrates the defeat by the maccabees of the syrian antiochius iv in 165 bc and their recapture of jerusalem . the museum explains that every night one more of the eight candles in the menorah , a nine-arm candelabrum , should be lit from the one in the middle and that the prayer spoken at the same time celebrates the defeat of the powerful by the weak . moder n holiday mixi n g more visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa lights the menorah a portion of the exhibition , which spreads through six halls and contains some 700 objects , deals with how to overcome the so-called " december dilemma " and send out neutral , politically-correct seasonal greetings . there has been a measure of cultural cross-pollination between the holidays as school christmas pageants become winter musicals and wishes of " merry christmas " turn to " happy holidays , " friedlander said . " it has become quite common for jewish families to give their children presents over hanukkah because it is so close to christmas , " she told the afp news agency . products for a n y celebratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new yorker magazine 's " the night before hanukkah " perhaps as an echo of the commercialization of christmas , one room at the exhibition is devoted to the wealth of products on sale around the celebrations . " a real american-type market has developed around hanukkah , " friedlander said .
" apart from sweets and the menorah which one finds in all different guises , the real trend of the year is a stuffed toy of the warrior judah maccabee , which is perhaps becoming the equivalent of father christmas for jewish children . " she said she had noticed that new york 's many mixed jewish-catholic couples have begun to combine christmas and hanukkah traditions .

" for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .
delayed acknowledgement west germany was indeed slow to come to turns with its nazi past .
the nuremberg war crimes tribunal brought the horrors of hitler 's regime to light , despite the fact that many germans did n't want to talk about what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has come clean about the holocaust " people were ashamed .
people felt guilty and did n't want to deal with it publicly , " benz said .
but they did n't deny it . " west germany first made an effort during the student demonstrations in the late 1960s .
they were n't just protesting against the vietnam war , but also demanded that their parents speak openly about the nazi past . an unexpectedly passionate debate developed in west germany in the late 1970s , when " holocaust , " an american mini-series about a jewish family during the third reich , was aired on television .
people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine . " it affects the agitator who claims the jews prey on the german people , that they invented the holocaust for that purpose , that foreigners should all be thrown out and that the discussion should finally be over with , " benz said .
" he must be punished because he engages in incitement of the masses , because he slanders the memory of those murdered , because he slanders our fellow citizens . " austria imposes even tougher penalties for such offences . historian and holocaust-denier david irving , who was recently arrested there , faces up to 20 years in jail . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants un to censure iran over president 's remarks germany plans to ask the un security council to punish iran for remarks made by its president questioning the reality of the holocaust , a senior government official says in an interview to be published sunday .

" however , i have been left with no alternative other than to proceed via the formal route to ensure microsoft 's compliance , " she added . the us company said the commission 's criticism were " unjustified " because it had submitted on time new documents it claimed that eu regulators and an independent trustee advising on the case had not even read . " we are fully committed to comply with the decision , " microsoft general counsel brad smith in a statement .

" it is now one year since the court of first instance confirmed that microsoft had to comply with the remedies imposed by the march 2004 decision , " the commission spokesman for competition , jonathan todd , told journalists .
" the commission very much regrets that one year on microsoft has still failed to do so , " he added . the case continues to drag on as the commission looks into " informal complaints " against the group . further n o n -complia n ce could lead to higher daily fi n es if microsoft remains defiant , the commission could decide to increase the daily fine . " we would have preferred obviously that microsoft complied quickly as they indicated this time last year that they would , " todd said .
" i would like to stress that we expect of course microsoft to comply with the march 2004 decision and not with their own interpretation of the march 2004 decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's brad smith says the company has done enough but microsoft insisted it had done everything to satisfy the commission , which accused of making inconsistent demands .

" we would have preferred obviously that microsoft complied quickly as they indicated this time last year that they would , " todd said .

germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .
" what i am dealing with is … common standards … and that is an area where there is consensus also from germany , " he said . tackli n g illegal immigratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes to deter illegal immigration in the face of the high numbers of migrants living illegally in the eu , lawful migration has to be eased and clear criteria for migration must be formulated , frattini added . " today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .
our aim must be to tackle this illegal immigration within a legal framework . " the eu 's efforts to counter illegal immigration has so far largely focused on strengthening border controls and procedures for expelling illegal migrants . frattini now wants rules that make it easier for low-skilled workers to enter the bloc , thus effectively deterring illegal work . one example the eu commissioner provided was that of the european agricultural sector , which usually faces demands for people willing to take on low-paid work . frattini said the eu should have a special system which would allow seasonal workers from outside the bloc to work in europe a number of months each year for four to five years .
that would discourage illegal entry or people overstaying their visa permits , he argued . luri n g the highly-skilled the european commission has also emphasized that it must make efforts to attract highly-skilled , talented workers from outside the eu who now prefer the us to europe . the eu commission estimates that by 2030 , europe will be facing a workforce shortfall of 20 million people . " we propose a speeded up application processes in order to encourage highly-talented people to come to europe to work here , " frattini said . in addition to make it easier for highly-skilled workers to gain entry to the eu , the proposals include the introduction of an eu work permit valid in all 25 member states as well as making it easier for non eu-workers holding jobs with european multinationals to travel and work in those companies ' european offices . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe gets tough on immigrant crisis the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .
" any other future compromise would have been considerably more expensive for germany , " christian democratic union finance expert steffen kampeter told reuters . over the seven-year budgetary period beginning in 2007 , germany will end up paying about .42 percent of its gross domestic product to brussels , an increase of .09 percent over 2004 .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .

" in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies .

" premiere now has an increased room for financial maneuver to further develop its choice of programs in all areas , " premiere announced on wednesday after the decision . but the channel headed by austrian georg kofler has no other genuine programming other than the bundesliga . even kofler admitted there was " no plan b , " although the group was quick to point out that it retained rights to show matches from the 2006 world cup finals that take place in germany and the champions league , europe 's top club competition , from 2006 until 2009 . but helmut thoma , the former head of the rtl media group , said premiere faced a struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere bet the farm on retaining the rights - and lost it all " the prospects of premiere have always gone hand-in-hand with the rights to soccer , " he told afp .
" it is going to be very hard to survive without soccer . " premiere only launched on the frankfurt stock market this year and its shares plunged more than 40 percent on wednesday in the wake of the decision . cable gets rights over premiere i n surprise move in a surprise decision , the dfl decided that live soccer in germany , one of europe 's top leagues , will be shown by arena , a consortium of two small cable tv operators that is in talks with the far bigger kabel deutschland . public broadcasters ard , zdf and dsf will show highlights . most german householders are connected to cable tv , which effectively means that soccer on television will become more widely accessible in germany . premiere , once part of the giant kirch media empire , built its success on soccer , modeling itself on france 's canal plus and the rupert murdoch-owned sky in britain . under the current system , nearly 3.4 million people pay premiere a minimum 20 euros -lrb- $ 23.7 -rrb- a month for the right to see bundesliga domestic matches and champions league games that the other channels are not allowed to broadcast . a n estimated 10 perce n t of subscribers may dump premiere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer premiere packages will be sold in the coming years , say analysts having lost the right to show live matches , many analysts are speculating that viewers will desert the channel .
some put the figure at around one third , while kofler believes it will be more like 10 percent . premiere had in fact made the most lucrative offer to the dfl in a bid to retain its rights - around 300 million euros a season , according to reports . but it made the crucial error of attempting to insist that the " sportschau " show , shown on state channel ard early on a saturday evening and the essential round-up for all football fans , be moved to a late night slot to give more time between the live games and the highlights . some observers believe that premiere was punished for its negotiating stance . " it was a bad negotiating technique , " said hypovereinsbank analyst peter-thilo hasler . new deal aims to " give the bu n desliga back to germa n y " many soccer fans were angry at the plan and the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d described it , tongue in cheek , as a " danger to national security . " " we are very happy to be able to give the bundesliga back to germany , " said bernard de roos , head of the winning unity consortium , which includes the ish and iesy operators with kabel deutschland expected to take a 50 percent share . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere loses live german soccer rights to cable group the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- has dropped longtime partner , pay-tv company premiere , as the provider of live bundesliga games and has ruled in favor of a consortium of cable television operators .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden .

" a real american-type market has developed around hanukkah , " friedlander said .
" apart from sweets and the menorah which one finds in all different guises , the real trend of the year is a stuffed toy of the warrior judah maccabee , which is perhaps becoming the equivalent of father christmas for jewish children .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .
" any other future compromise would have been considerably more expensive for germany , " christian democratic union finance expert steffen kampeter told reuters . over the seven-year budgetary period beginning in 2007 , germany will end up paying about .42 percent of its gross domestic product to brussels , an increase of .09 percent over 2004 .
britain , italy and france will also end up handing more to the eu . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de budget deal hints at changing power structure in europe the eu budget was saved by the bloc 's most powerful leaders .

" premiere now has an increased room for financial maneuver to further develop its choice of programs in all areas , " premiere announced on wednesday after the decision . but the channel headed by austrian georg kofler has no other genuine programming other than the bundesliga . even kofler admitted there was " no plan b , " although the group was quick to point out that it retained rights to show matches from the 2006 world cup finals that take place in germany and the champions league , europe 's top club competition , from 2006 until 2009 . but helmut thoma , the former head of the rtl media group , said premiere faced a struggle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere bet the farm on retaining the rights - and lost it all " the prospects of premiere have always gone hand-in-hand with the rights to soccer , " he told afp .
" it is going to be very hard to survive without soccer .

some put the figure at around one third , while kofler believes it will be more like 10 percent . premiere had in fact made the most lucrative offer to the dfl in a bid to retain its rights - around 300 million euros a season , according to reports . but it made the crucial error of attempting to insist that the " sportschau " show , shown on state channel ard early on a saturday evening and the essential round-up for all football fans , be moved to a late night slot to give more time between the live games and the highlights . some observers believe that premiere was punished for its negotiating stance . " it was a bad negotiating technique , " said hypovereinsbank analyst peter-thilo hasler . new deal aims to " give the bu n desliga back to germa n y " many soccer fans were angry at the plan and the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d described it , tongue in cheek , as a " danger to national security .

though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .
but that has changed .
the suicide attacks present a much greater danger .
there 's no adequate protection from attackers prepared to sacrifice their lives .
even the " dingo " armored vehicles defense minister jung handed over to the troops ca n't change that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier dies when in a suicide attack near a nato vehicle in kabul the new kind of threat fuels the suspicion that those pulling the strings have changed .
while in the past former militia leaders and drug barons trying to defend their realms were considered responsible , the new wave of violence brings to mind the work of islamic terrorists .
their aim : putting an end to the process of democratization .
afghan politicians fear that their country could become a new battlefield of islamic terror .
ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .

germany , hungary , italy and latvia are already facing a fall in the working age population . harmo n izatio n , but n o quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini has ambitious plans to plug the eu 's looming gaps in skilled labor at the same time , frattini said he was aware of the nervousness in national capitals on sensitive issues of asylum and immigration . he assured that in the face of strong resistance from heavyweight members like germany and france , the eu would not make immigration quotas binding on any of its members . " it is up to germany , it is up to each member state to decide whether and how many people have to be admitted every year .
i will respect this principle , " frattini said . the new german interior minister wolfgang schäuble had made it clear to frattini that germany 's tough stance on the issue would n't change even after a change of government in berlin . frattini however said that the aim of the eu was to harmonize and coordinate immigration standards and the rights of non-eu workers across the bloc .

" today , it 's the case that all member states have their own immigration policies and at the same time a high level of illegal immigration .
our aim must be to tackle this illegal immigration within a legal framework . " the eu 's efforts to counter illegal immigration has so far largely focused on strengthening border controls and procedures for expelling illegal migrants . frattini now wants rules that make it easier for low-skilled workers to enter the bloc , thus effectively deterring illegal work . one example the eu commissioner provided was that of the european agricultural sector , which usually faces demands for people willing to take on low-paid work . frattini said the eu should have a special system which would allow seasonal workers from outside the bloc to work in europe a number of months each year for four to five years .
that would discourage illegal entry or people overstaying their visa permits , he argued . luri n g the highly-skilled the european commission has also emphasized that it must make efforts to attract highly-skilled , talented workers from outside the eu who now prefer the us to europe . the eu commission estimates that by 2030 , europe will be facing a workforce shortfall of 20 million people . " we propose a speeded up application processes in order to encourage highly-talented people to come to europe to work here , " frattini said . in addition to make it easier for highly-skilled workers to gain entry to the eu , the proposals include the introduction of an eu work permit valid in all 25 member states as well as making it easier for non eu-workers holding jobs with european multinationals to travel and work in those companies ' european offices . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe gets tough on immigrant crisis the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.12.2005 opinion : germany 's afghan job still important , still dangerous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kabul , jung said 1,850 german peacekeepers would move north almost 2,000 german soldiers will move from kabul to northern afghanistan , leaving 500 in the capital , defense minister jung said on thursday .
though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .
but that has changed .
the suicide attacks present a much greater danger .
there 's no adequate protection from attackers prepared to sacrifice their lives .
even the " dingo " armored vehicles defense minister jung handed over to the troops ca n't change that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier dies when in a suicide attack near a nato vehicle in kabul the new kind of threat fuels the suspicion that those pulling the strings have changed .
while in the past former militia leaders and drug barons trying to defend their realms were considered responsible , the new wave of violence brings to mind the work of islamic terrorists .
their aim : putting an end to the process of democratization .
afghan politicians fear that their country could become a new battlefield of islamic terror .
ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .
without security there is no democracy . joachim hagen , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german isaf troops honor fallen soldier in a memorial service on tuesday , isaf soldiers in kabul paid tribute to a german peacekeeper killed in monday 's suicide attacks .

their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .

they were n't just protesting against the vietnam war , but also demanded that their parents speak openly about the nazi past . an unexpectedly passionate debate developed in west germany in the late 1970s , when " holocaust , " an american mini-series about a jewish family during the third reich , was aired on television .
people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine . " it affects the agitator who claims the jews prey on the german people , that they invented the holocaust for that purpose , that foreigners should all be thrown out and that the discussion should finally be over with , " benz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.12.2005 no room for holocaust denial in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's memorial to the holocaust was opened in may this year german politicians swiftly condemned iran 's president when he called into question israel 's right to exist and said the holocaust was a myth .
their reactions reflect a broad consensus on the issue in german society . germany 's parliamentarians were in agreement : president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli and anti-jewish remarks were " entirely unacceptable . " ahmadinejad caused international outrage in the past few weeks with a series of remarks , in which he said israel - described as a tumor - should be wiped off the map , or moved to europe , casting doubt on whether the mass extermination of jews in nazi germany ever took place . " for us , the unconditional acknowledgement of the state of israel 's right to exist is one of the fundamental pillars of german foreign policy , " pronounced deputy foreign minister gernot erler in the name of the german government .
aside from a small group of right-wing extremists , a broad consensus in german society sees the world war ii extermination of six million jews as a historical fact that can not be denied , according to historian wolfgang benz , who heads the center for anti-semitism research in berlin . " everyone has gotten it : the holocaust took place , the genocide existed .
and it wrought horrible consequences that we continue to suffer from today , " benz said .
delayed acknowledgement west germany was indeed slow to come to turns with its nazi past .
the nuremberg war crimes tribunal brought the horrors of hitler 's regime to light , despite the fact that many germans did n't want to talk about what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has come clean about the holocaust " people were ashamed .
people felt guilty and did n't want to deal with it publicly , " benz said .
but they did n't deny it . " west germany first made an effort during the student demonstrations in the late 1960s .
they were n't just protesting against the vietnam war , but also demanded that their parents speak openly about the nazi past . an unexpectedly passionate debate developed in west germany in the late 1970s , when " holocaust , " an american mini-series about a jewish family during the third reich , was aired on television .
people began to grasp the emotional dimension of the holocaust in which real people were killed , not just an abstract figure of six million , benz said . in the mid-1980s , german newspapers were filled with the so-called historiker-streit , a passionate dispute between german historians , not about whether the holocaust occurred , but about whether it was a unique event in world history .
in the end , the opinion prevailed that the holocaust was a crime that could not be equated or even compared to the horrors of stalin 's regime in the soviet union .
holocaust denial illegal germany 's parliament passed legislation in 1985 , making it a crime to deny the extermination of the jews .
in 1994 , the law was tightened . now , anyone who publicly endorses , denies or plays down the genocide against the jews faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and no less than the imposition of a fine . " it affects the agitator who claims the jews prey on the german people , that they invented the holocaust for that purpose , that foreigners should all be thrown out and that the discussion should finally be over with , " benz said .
" he must be punished because he engages in incitement of the masses , because he slanders the memory of those murdered , because he slanders our fellow citizens . " austria imposes even tougher penalties for such offences . historian and holocaust-denier david irving , who was recently arrested there , faces up to 20 years in jail . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants un to censure iran over president 's remarks germany plans to ask the un security council to punish iran for remarks made by its president questioning the reality of the holocaust , a senior government official says in an interview to be published sunday .

" microsoft leaves kroes with " n o alter n ative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to show the commission can not be ignored " i have given microsoft every opportunity to comply with its obligations , " said competition commissioner neelie kroes in a statement .
" however , i have been left with no alternative other than to proceed via the formal route to ensure microsoft 's compliance , " she added . the us company said the commission 's criticism were " unjustified " because it had submitted on time new documents it claimed that eu regulators and an independent trustee advising on the case had not even read . " we are fully committed to comply with the decision , " microsoft general counsel brad smith in a statement . " we 've shipped a new version of windows , we 've paid an historic fine , and we 've provided unprecedented access to microsoft technology to promote inter-operability with other industry players , " he added . tech gia n t massively fi n ed for abusi n g its positio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft manufactures the leading operation system in the industry the eu competition watchdog already fined the software group in march 2004 a record 497 million euros for abusing its dominant market position . it also called on microsoft to market a version of its windows operating system without bundling it with its software media player and to divulge information about its operating system needed by manufacturers of competing products . the eu 's second-highest court gave its backing in december 2004 to the commission order to implement remedies , which microsoft wanted suspended . " it is now one year since the court of first instance confirmed that microsoft had to comply with the remedies imposed by the march 2004 decision , " the commission spokesman for competition , jonathan todd , told journalists .
" the commission very much regrets that one year on microsoft has still failed to do so , " he added . the case continues to drag on as the commission looks into " informal complaints " against the group . further n o n -complia n ce could lead to higher daily fi n es if microsoft remains defiant , the commission could decide to increase the daily fine . " we would have preferred obviously that microsoft complied quickly as they indicated this time last year that they would , " todd said .
" i would like to stress that we expect of course microsoft to comply with the march 2004 decision and not with their own interpretation of the march 2004 decision .

though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .

defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .

" " they decorate their windows in red and blue , red for christmas and blue for hanukkah , " she said .

" no historic co n n ectio n betwee n holidays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient jewish roots are all that connect hanukkah and christmas roots in the jewish history are the only connections christmas has with hanukkah - the eight-day festival of lights which begins on the 25th day of the hebrew month of kislev . to those who are strangers to the customs of hanukkah in berlin , where the holocaust reduced a jewish population of about 190,000 to 10,000 registered with the city 's jewish community , the exhibition recalls that it celebrates the defeat by the maccabees of the syrian antiochius iv in 165 bc and their recapture of jerusalem . the museum explains that every night one more of the eight candles in the menorah , a nine-arm candelabrum , should be lit from the one in the middle and that the prayer spoken at the same time celebrates the defeat of the powerful by the weak . moder n holiday mixi n g more visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa lights the menorah a portion of the exhibition , which spreads through six halls and contains some 700 objects , deals with how to overcome the so-called " december dilemma " and send out neutral , politically-correct seasonal greetings . there has been a measure of cultural cross-pollination between the holidays as school christmas pageants become winter musicals and wishes of " merry christmas " turn to " happy holidays , " friedlander said . " it has become quite common for jewish families to give their children presents over hanukkah because it is so close to christmas , " she told the afp news agency . products for a n y celebratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new yorker magazine 's " the night before hanukkah " perhaps as an echo of the commercialization of christmas , one room at the exhibition is devoted to the wealth of products on sale around the celebrations . " a real american-type market has developed around hanukkah , " friedlander said .
" apart from sweets and the menorah which one finds in all different guises , the real trend of the year is a stuffed toy of the warrior judah maccabee , which is perhaps becoming the equivalent of father christmas for jewish children . " she said she had noticed that new york 's many mixed jewish-catholic couples have begun to combine christmas and hanukkah traditions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2005 eu budget deal costs germany more than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after lavish praise for her negotiating skills , merkel is now under fire praised as a dealmaker par excellence after engineering last week 's eu budget compromise , angela merkel has drawn the the opposition 's ire after it emerged that germany 's payments to brussels are set to increase . the annual check germany , already the european union 's biggest net-contributor before the newest deal , sends to finance the european union grew by another 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- as part of the delicate budget deal chancellor merkel brokered last week . " we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.12.2005 opinion : germany 's afghan job still important , still dangerous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kabul , jung said 1,850 german peacekeepers would move north almost 2,000 german soldiers will move from kabul to northern afghanistan , leaving 500 in the capital , defense minister jung said on thursday .
though kabul remains dangerous , it 's even worse elsewhere in the country . franz-josef jung learned his lesson .
nowadays a good defense minister 's visit to the troops includes mentioning the looming danger but still gives the impression of confidence .
particularly before christmas .
at the same time , this visit ca n't hide the fact that the german soldiers in afghanistan have to reckon on deadly attacks every day .
the past few weeks have shown that clearly enough .
just five weeks ago , a german soldier was killed in a suicide attack in kabul . so far , the danger to the isaf peacekeeping troops in afghanistan has been fairly predictable .
often only a badly aimed rocket flew over the heads of the soldiers .
but that has changed .
the suicide attacks present a much greater danger .
there 's no adequate protection from attackers prepared to sacrifice their lives .
even the " dingo " armored vehicles defense minister jung handed over to the troops ca n't change that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier dies when in a suicide attack near a nato vehicle in kabul the new kind of threat fuels the suspicion that those pulling the strings have changed .
while in the past former militia leaders and drug barons trying to defend their realms were considered responsible , the new wave of violence brings to mind the work of islamic terrorists .
their aim : putting an end to the process of democratization .
afghan politicians fear that their country could become a new battlefield of islamic terror .
ce n tral afgha n ista n left i n the lurch ?
defense minister jung burst into this tense situation with his announcement about moving the majority of german soldiers in kabul to mazar-i-sharif , in the north .
it 's the right decision .
german soldiers are needed much more desperately in the north of afghanistan than in kabul , where local police and soldiers keep order . however , the effect of this announcement on the afghans is hard to anticipate .
the previous day , dissatisfaction on the afghan side was apparent when us defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that up to 3,000 american soldiers would be pulled out of the country .
the fear in kabul is that the move could encourage the insurgents to carry out more attacks .
the germans must now avoid giving the impression that they 're deserting the people in central afghanistan . during his visit to camp warehouse , defense minister jung referred again and again to how the process of democratization would make afghan more secure .
unfortunately , that 's just wishful thinking .
on the contrary , democracy does n't lead to security .
without security there is no democracy . joachim hagen , ndr -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german isaf troops honor fallen soldier in a memorial service on tuesday , isaf soldiers in kabul paid tribute to a german peacekeeper killed in monday 's suicide attacks .

thierse suggested a set of rule to create a correlation between managers ' performance and the compensation they receive to ensure they work in their company 's best interest . politicians call for ackermann 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has to prove he was working in deutsche bank 's best interest thierse said he wanted to see whether business leaders would implement voluntary ethics guidelines after seeing the case 's results . " if that does not happen , and two or three years from now we face the next problems , then i would be for making the rules mandatory , " he added . nearly all germany 's political parties called for ackermann to step down , at least until the case against him is closed , fearing germany could end up labeled as a socially irresponsible country that permits predatory business practices without regard for the nation 's employees . the judges made it clear " that no stock can be given to the immorality that has spread over top levels of business , " former social democratic party general secretary klaus uwe benneter told the n-tv news station . ackermann and five co-defendants are accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped 57 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- worth of golden handshakes after the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . dangers for german business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders fear court decisions could hinder innovation in germany but not everyone agrees that politicians should become overly involved in the business world . " politicians would be well advised to restrain themselves , " christian democratic union deputy chairman wolfgang bosbach said of the calls for ackermann 's resignation .
" this is an issue for the deutsche bank , the supervisory board and its chairman . " german business leaders added that the country stands to lose in a globalized world if courts are able to get involved in corporate decision making . " the judgment shows that we in germany have a backwards case-law , " jan pieter krahnen of center of financial studies in frankfurt told the berliner zeitung .
" it could mean a real set-back for the german economy 's power to compete . " ackermann has run deutsche bank according to an anglo-saxon model that puts investors ' concerns first in a country where the state and employees ' interests are normally given the most importance , according to krahnen . seen by many as a leader who was able to improve deutsche bank 's international position - and bottom line , the retrial decision could scare away foreign investors , afraid their success could be directly followed by lawsuits . during the trial , ackermann , who earned 11 million euros last year , said germany needed to " wake up " to the reality of bonuses , such as those paid to mannesmann executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers divided over mannesmann ruling european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job .

thierse suggested a set of rule to create a correlation between managers ' performance and the compensation they receive to ensure they work in their company 's best interest . politicians call for ackermann 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has to prove he was working in deutsche bank 's best interest thierse said he wanted to see whether business leaders would implement voluntary ethics guidelines after seeing the case 's results . " if that does not happen , and two or three years from now we face the next problems , then i would be for making the rules mandatory , " he added . nearly all germany 's political parties called for ackermann to step down , at least until the case against him is closed , fearing germany could end up labeled as a socially irresponsible country that permits predatory business practices without regard for the nation 's employees . the judges made it clear " that no stock can be given to the immorality that has spread over top levels of business , " former social democratic party general secretary klaus uwe benneter told the n-tv news station . ackermann and five co-defendants are accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped 57 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- worth of golden handshakes after the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . dangers for german business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders fear court decisions could hinder innovation in germany but not everyone agrees that politicians should become overly involved in the business world . " politicians would be well advised to restrain themselves , " christian democratic union deputy chairman wolfgang bosbach said of the calls for ackermann 's resignation .
" this is an issue for the deutsche bank , the supervisory board and its chairman . " german business leaders added that the country stands to lose in a globalized world if courts are able to get involved in corporate decision making . " the judgment shows that we in germany have a backwards case-law , " jan pieter krahnen of center of financial studies in frankfurt told the berliner zeitung .
" it could mean a real set-back for the german economy 's power to compete . " ackermann has run deutsche bank according to an anglo-saxon model that puts investors ' concerns first in a country where the state and employees ' interests are normally given the most importance , according to krahnen . seen by many as a leader who was able to improve deutsche bank 's international position - and bottom line , the retrial decision could scare away foreign investors , afraid their success could be directly followed by lawsuits . during the trial , ackermann , who earned 11 million euros last year , said germany needed to " wake up " to the reality of bonuses , such as those paid to mannesmann executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers divided over mannesmann ruling european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job .

" we will have to pay less than we had expected , but we will pay more than in the past , " the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg said , confirming a report in the berliner zeitung daily . the paper said that from 2007 germany 's net contribution - the difference between the money paid into the eu pot and the money received in grants and payments from brussels - would rise to 10.4 billion euros , equivalent to a rise of around two billion euros a year .
steg told a press conference that the figure of two billion euros was essentially correct , but said it was the " current state " of the estimates and not a " calculation " nor the official figure . the extra money , which steg said the government was " willing to pay for the historic unification of europe , " will be headed mainly to the 10 new and poorer eu member states .
eastern germany will also see less benefit from eu money in the form of structural aid . " a fly in the soup " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made the deal at her first eu finance meeting opposition politicians have criticized the glowing praise showered on merkel last week for getting all 25 eu heads of state - including bitter rivals france and britain - to agree on a budget at germany 's cost . " merkel was celebrated up and down for the wonderful results , " green party finance spokeswoman christine scheel told the berliner zeitung on friday .
" but when the results lead to a considerably higher german contribute , there 's a fly in the soup . " other members of the opposition wondered how germany would pay the added costs at a time when it can not afford the extra burden . " how should we consolidate the german budget when it is continually saddled with extra costs ? "
hermann otto solms of the free-market liberal free democratic party asked in the newspaper .
" from a financial policy point of view this famous compromise is just plain irresponsible . " in 2005 , the german domestic budget deficit is set to violate eu spending limits for a fourth year in a row , a problem merkel plans to solve by increasing value added tax in 2007 . best deal possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac was n't willing to cut agriculture spending though they 're not likely to relish the idea of shelling out more to the eu , members of the governing grand coalition said a better deal could not be expected than the one merkel negotiated after a marathon session that led to budget of 1.045 percent of the gross national income . " in this particular situation , mrs merkel made a completely sound decision , " social democrat and bundestag vice-president wolfgang thierse told a bavarian public radio station . stressing the deal 's positive aspects , the government 's deputy speaker steg pointed out that merkel 's late-night agreement was still a 600-million-euro improvement on earlier suggestions from both the british and luxembourg presidencies . " the summit succeeded last week in demonstrating that the eu is capable of action .
germany played a crucial mediating role without sacrificing national interests .
we have made clear we see this as a huge success , " steg said .
" any other future compromise would have been considerably more expensive for germany , " christian democratic union finance expert steffen kampeter told reuters . over the seven-year budgetary period beginning in 2007 , germany will end up paying about .42 percent of its gross domestic product to brussels , an increase of .09 percent over 2004 .
britain , italy and france will also end up handing more to the eu . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de budget deal hints at changing power structure in europe the eu budget was saved by the bloc 's most powerful leaders .

how lovely .
plenty of people can sympathise with such a sentiment .
this is the time of year to plaster the insincere smile on the face , stuff the grateful handshake with false bonhomie , and insist that the woefully misconceived gift you 've just unwrapped is just what you 've always wanted .
if it really is socks - or other forms of knitwear - then you 're probably stuck with the undesirable item in question .
if , on the other hand , you 're a games-loather who 's somehow ended up with an xbox 360 - the holy grail in this year 's technology stakes - or a plastic plate user who 's got a 30-piece dinner set , then there are other options .
in that case , christmas could turn into a nice little earner after all .
flog it the first port of call in this day and age is the obvious one : sell it on the internet .
and most people in this kind of situation are likely to turn to ebay , the grand-daddy of online auction sites .
in years gone by , the company - on whose website can be found millions of sales a day - actually set up a christmas zone especially to cater for the gift resale market .
" the new zone has been developed on the premise that one man 's rubbish is another man 's gold , " the site proudly declared in 1999 .
these days , ebay is a little more circumspect , and foregoes a dedicated area - leaving users to post their bargains as they would any other day .
count the cost not that such a move has stopped it eyeing up the potential market .
in a survey conducted on ebay 's behalf by icm , two thirds of adults said they would consider selling on unwanted presents .
almost a quarter of fussy londoners said they received undesirable items at christmas , while fewer than one in ten people in yorkshire would admit to such ingratitude .
in a similar vein , brunel university academic charles dennis has been checking on the cost of christmas .
dr dennis says about £ 15.5bn is spent on presents each year - about £ 330 per person - and believes that almost one in seven presents , or 13.5 % , are ditched .
that 's £ 2bn - or £ 40 for every adult in the uk .
about the same proportion again simply get stuck in the back of a cupboard .
gifts that keep on giving but the surprise in dr dennis 's figures is that few britons seem to be on the hunt for a quick buck from christmas .
of the unwanted gifts that stay out of the broom cupboard , about a third are simply thrown away .
more than half , however , go to the country 's thousands of charity shops - making a quick trawl through oxfam or the cancer research trust a solid alternative to the high street sales .
about one in 10 , according to dr dennis , are recycled into gifts for other unsuspecting recipients .
or , if you 're feeling particularly bitter , kept for returning to the original donor the following year .
a rather more efficient form of donation can be found in freecycling - a relatively new habit , but one which could pay dividends and prove as addictive for its adherents as ebay frequently turns out to be .
you simply log the details of what you want to get rid of on a website , and then give it to anyone who offers to come and take it off your hands .
freecycling websites tend to be closed communities .
you have to have made an offer before you can claim one , and users look rather sourly on anyone simply trying to hoover up other people 's goodwill .
but at least you 'll know your stuff is going to a good home .
one careful owner there 's one unwanted present , though , which is going to prove impossible to get rid of .
this year has seen the renaissance of the charity " goodwill gift " - where the giver donates something , frequently the cost of some livestock , typically a goat - on the recipient 's behalf .
of course , it 's not as if it 's a huge problem .
after all , you 're not the one looking after it in the back garden .
but if you are feeling aggrieved , or wonder whether the gift was for your benefit or the donor 's , then there 's always an alternative suggested by writer andrew brown .
goats , he says , eat anything .
" so on boxing day , i plan to open a web site offering charity gifts for the rest of us , " he declares .
" ship your rubbish off to feed a goat !
save the environment , and , if you want , we 'll send a card to the original giver of the gift you have recycled . "

how lovely. ebay is keen to be the place to come for selling unwanted gifts plenty of people can sympathise with such a sentiment .
this is the time of year to plaster the insincere smile on the face , stuff the grateful handshake with false bonhomie , and insist that the woefully misconceived gift you 've just unwrapped is just what you 've always wanted .
if it really is socks - or other forms of knitwear - then you 're probably stuck with the undesirable item in question .
if , on the other hand , you 're a games-loather who 's somehow ended up with an xbox 360 - the holy grail in this year 's technology stakes - or a plastic plate user who 's got a 30-piece dinner set , then there are other options .
in that case , christmas could turn into a nice little earner after all .
flog it the first port of call in this day and age is the obvious one : sell it on the internet .
and most people in this kind of situation are likely to turn to ebay , the grand-daddy of online auction sites .
in years gone by , the company - on whose website can be found millions of sales a day - actually set up a christmas zone especially to cater for the gift resale market .
" the new zone has been developed on the premise that one man 's rubbish is another man 's gold , " the site proudly declared in 1999 .
these days , ebay is a little more circumspect , and foregoes a dedicated area - leaving users to post their bargains as they would any other day .
count the cost not that such a move has stopped it eyeing up the potential market .
in a survey conducted on ebay 's behalf by icm , two thirds of adults said they would consider selling on unwanted presents .
many britons show an altruistic streak with their cast-off gifts almost a quarter of fussy londoners said they received undesirable items at christmas , while fewer than one in ten people in yorkshire would admit to such ingratitude .
in a similar vein , brunel university academic charles dennis has been checking on the cost of christmas .
dr dennis says about £ 15.5bn is spent on presents each year - about £ 330 per person - and believes that almost one in seven presents , or 13.5 % , are ditched .
that 's £ 2bn - or £ 40 for every adult in the uk .
about the same proportion again simply get stuck in the back of a cupboard .
gifts that keep on giving but the surprise in dr dennis 's figures is that few britons seem to be on the hunt for a quick buck from christmas .
of the unwanted gifts that stay out of the broom cupboard , about a third are simply thrown away .
more than half , however , go to the country 's thousands of charity shops - making a quick trawl through oxfam or the cancer research trust a solid alternative to the high street sales .

or , if you 're feeling particularly bitter , kept for returning to the original donor the following year .
unwanted presents in the making ?
a rather more efficient form of donation can be found in freecycling - a relatively new habit , but one which could pay dividends and prove as addictive for its adherents as ebay frequently turns out to be .
you simply log the details of what you want to get rid of on a website , and then give it to anyone who offers to come and take it off your hands .
freecycling websites tend to be closed communities .
you have to have made an offer before you can claim one , and users look rather sourly on anyone simply trying to hoover up other people 's goodwill .
but at least you 'll know your stuff is going to a good home .
one careful owner there 's one unwanted present , though , which is going to prove impossible to get rid of .
this year has seen the renaissance of the charity " goodwill gift " - where the giver donates something , frequently the cost of some livestock , typically a goat - on the recipient 's behalf .
of course , it 's not as if it 's a huge problem .
after all , you 're not the one looking after it in the back garden .
but if you are feeling aggrieved , or wonder whether the gift was for your benefit or the donor 's , then there 's always an alternative suggested by writer andrew brown .
goats , he says , eat anything .
" so on boxing day , i plan to open a web site offering charity gifts for the rest of us , " he declares .
" ship your rubbish off to feed a goat !
save the environment , and , if you want , we 'll send a card to the original giver of the gift you have recycled . "
recycling as revenge .

instead your granny , or other elderly relative , is in fact being pretty cutting-edge on the drinks front .
yes , after years - even decades - of sorry social exclusion , sherry is now very fashionable again .
cynics may scoff into their pints of lager , but uk sherry sales have risen strongly over the past year .
sainsbury 's says it is now selling more sherry than ever before .
and more importantly for the future prosperity of the spanish fortified wine 's producers , the sales surge is being led by younger people .
according to producer gonzalez byass , sales of its market-leading tio pepe brand among 35- to 44-year-olds have surged 80 % this year .
drier styles the big increase in sherry sales is being led by dry , pale sherries , such as tio pepe .
sherry production is centred on the town of jerez unlike sweet sherries , they are made to be drunk chilled , and people are discovering that they make a refreshing aperitif .
and while it is highly unlikely that gangs of 18-year-olds are going to start ordering sherry down the pub in place of their lagers and alcopops , the " 30-something " generation are now enjoying dry sherry at home or out for a meal in ever-growing numbers .
but why exactly have sherry sales , which seemed in terminal decline , suddenly taken off in the uk ?
wine experts put it down to a number of main factors , including cheap flights and something called the " tapas effect " .
jeremy rockett , uk marketing director for gonzalez byass , happily admits that sherry used to have a bit of an image problem .
" when most people thought of sherry , it was a sweet , dark drink that was drunk by your gran , " he says .
" it had a completely stuffy image that we had to shake off .
" we needed to make people realise that dry sherries are the complete opposite of this - they are light and refreshing and really complement food .
and very importantly , they need to be chilled . "
long weekends the sherry producers ' need to change the perception of their drink was made much easier by the huge growth in budget flights over the past 10 years .
how sherry used to be presented in the uk flights that enabled british holidaymakers to discover a spain away from the british-orientated " bucket and spade " package tours on the med .
" suddenly you had uk holidaymakers discovering the real spain , and going for long weekends in barcelona and madrid , " says mr rockett .
" here they discovered traditional spanish tapas food , and the drink that best goes with this - dry sherry .
" at the same time , there has been a big increase in tapas restaurants in the uk .
" this has obviously been a great help , but we do like to stress that sherry goes with all good foods , not just spanish cuisine .
" and you should drink sherry from a normal white wine glass . "
sherry recipes melissa draycott , sainsbury 's sherry buyer , agrees that the big increase in the popularity of tapas has caused a knock-on rise in sherry sales - the tapas effect .
sherry facts a wine fortified with added brandy dry styles include fino and manzanilla made in and around jerez in south west spain " dry sherry in particular has become more fashionable and is being drunk as a refreshing chilled aperitif or an accompaniment to spanish food , such as chorizo and olives , " she says .
" increasingly , restaurants and chefs are recommending sherry to complement food , and developing simple and versatile recipes using sherry . "
waitrose said the situation was the same at its stores - so much so that it has launched its own tapas range , which it offers at in-store tastings alongside a number of its sherries .
" in the year to date , all sherry styles have seen sales increases , with medium styles growing 20 % and sweet sherries growing over 10 % , " it said .
but before your grandmother starts smiling triumphantly , and telling you how young people do n't know anything these days , there may be one thing she is doing wrong - sherry wo n't keep from one christmas to the next .
instead of putting the bottle to the back of the cupboard for next year , you need to help her drink it up .

instead your granny , or other elderly relative , is in fact being pretty cutting-edge on the drinks front .
yes , after years - even decades - of sorry social exclusion , sherry is now very fashionable again .
cynics may scoff into their pints of lager , but uk sherry sales have risen strongly over the past year .
sainsbury 's says it is now selling more sherry than ever before .
and more importantly for the future prosperity of the spanish fortified wine 's producers , the sales surge is being led by younger people .
according to producer gonzalez byass , sales of its market-leading tio pepe brand among 35- to 44-year-olds have surged 80 % this year .
drier styles the big increase in sherry sales is being led by dry , pale sherries , such as tio pepe .
sherry production is centred on the town of jerez unlike sweet sherries , they are made to be drunk chilled , and people are discovering that they make a refreshing aperitif .
and while it is highly unlikely that gangs of 18-year-olds are going to start ordering sherry down the pub in place of their lagers and alcopops , the " 30-something " generation are now enjoying dry sherry at home or out for a meal in ever-growing numbers .
but why exactly have sherry sales , which seemed in terminal decline , suddenly taken off in the uk ?
wine experts put it down to a number of main factors , including cheap flights and something called the " tapas effect " .
jeremy rockett , uk marketing director for gonzalez byass , happily admits that sherry used to have a bit of an image problem .
" when most people thought of sherry , it was a sweet , dark drink that was drunk by your gran , " he says .
" it had a completely stuffy image that we had to shake off .
" we needed to make people realise that dry sherries are the complete opposite of this - they are light and refreshing and really complement food .
and very importantly , they need to be chilled . "
long weekends the sherry producers ' need to change the perception of their drink was made much easier by the huge growth in budget flights over the past 10 years .
how sherry used to be presented in the uk flights that enabled british holidaymakers to discover a spain away from the british-orientated " bucket and spade " package tours on the med .
" suddenly you had uk holidaymakers discovering the real spain , and going for long weekends in barcelona and madrid , " says mr rockett .
" here they discovered traditional spanish tapas food , and the drink that best goes with this - dry sherry .
" at the same time , there has been a big increase in tapas restaurants in the uk .
" this has obviously been a great help , but we do like to stress that sherry goes with all good foods , not just spanish cuisine .
" and you should drink sherry from a normal white wine glass . "
sherry recipes melissa draycott , sainsbury 's sherry buyer , agrees that the big increase in the popularity of tapas has caused a knock-on rise in sherry sales - the tapas effect .
sherry facts a wine fortified with added brandy dry styles include fino and manzanilla made in and around jerez in south west spain " dry sherry in particular has become more fashionable and is being drunk as a refreshing chilled aperitif or an accompaniment to spanish food , such as chorizo and olives , " she says .
" increasingly , restaurants and chefs are recommending sherry to complement food , and developing simple and versatile recipes using sherry . "
waitrose said the situation was the same at its stores - so much so that it has launched its own tapas range , which it offers at in-store tastings alongside a number of its sherries .
" in the year to date , all sherry styles have seen sales increases , with medium styles growing 20 % and sweet sherries growing over 10 % , " it said .
but before your grandmother starts smiling triumphantly , and telling you how young people do n't know anything these days , there may be one thing she is doing wrong - sherry wo n't keep from one christmas to the next .
instead of putting the bottle to the back of the cupboard for next year , you need to help her drink it up .

mr blair told them : " i just want you to know how grateful we are for the work you are doing here . "
he said they were helping to build democracy and they could return home when iraqi forces were up to strength .
mr blair was upbeat about troop withdrawal in 2006 but did not set any timetable , said the bbc 's james landale who was travelling with him .
troop withdrawal the prime minister said the situation had " changed completely " since he visited iraq last year and that it was the government 's intention to " draw down our forces " .
" he -lrb- tony blair -rrb- and his officials have been more upbeat about the possibility of beginning the process of withdrawing the troops from iraq , " mr landale said .
he said mr blair rejected setting an artificial deadline , but said what he failed to do was " dismiss out of hand " remarks by a uk general a few weeks ago that troops could start to be withdrawn in six months time .
mr blair said : " it all depends on the mission being fulfilled ... this is to have the political process completed and building up the iraqi capabilities ... "
he added : " but there 's no reason ... if everything goes to plan ... we want to draw down our forces , we do not want to keep people here any longer than we need to . "
the important thing is to try and help this country become the democracy its people want it to be tony blair call for new iraqi election mr blair 's spokesman said no consideration could be taken about troop numbers until at least after the new government had been formed and the spring provincial elections are held in iraq .
us defense secretary donald rumsfeld is also making an unannounced visit to iraq to meet military commanders and troops .
mr rumsfeld flew to baghdad from afghanistan , amid signs washington is planning further troop cuts .
his arrival in iraq came as sunni arab and secular parties in iraq threaten to boycott the country 's new parliament , complaining that last week 's elections were marred by fraud .
mr blair , whose visit had been kept secret , touched down in basra in an raf hercules from kuwait .
he then transferred by helicopter to the shaiba logistics base , where he addressed some of the 4,000 troops based there from the back of a low-loader truck .
he told them : " i know it 's particularly tough being away from your families at christmas and new year .
" i just want you to know how grateful we are for the work you are doing here .
however tough it is , i hope you have some sense of how important it is . "
democracy he said 10 million iraqis had voted in recent elections .
" the important thing is to try and help this country become the democracy its people want it to be , " mr blair told the troops .
that would be done by providing the security which allowed the iraqi forces to build up their own strength " and then of course we can eventually draw down our own capability " .
" the importance of this is probably greater today than it has ever been , " said mr blair .
" because , if iraq does stabilise and become a democracy , then the region is more safe , our own country is more safe , because international terrorism will have been dealt a huge blow .
" if we manage to defeat the terrorism here , we will have dealt it a blow worldwide .
i know how dangerous it is sometimes , because we have lost good colleagues here - and it is tough , i know , sometimes . "
' six figures ' but whatever the dangers " you can look back at this time and you can be very , very proud of what you have done " , the prime minister told the troops .
mr blair met top us and british defence officials , including gen george casey head of coalition forces , during his flying visit - his fourth trip to iraq since the us-led invasion .
former british ambassador to baghdad , sir jeremy greenstock , has said a total withdrawal of coalition troops was " some way away " , but that he expected numbers to begin reducing by the end of 2006 .
" if iraq goes well you can draw down to half of that -lrb- the total coalition troop numbers -rrb- by the end of 2006 , " he told bbc radio 4 's world at one .
" if things do n't go well , the coalition should still be in six figures . "
the uk has 8,500 servicemen and women stationed in iraq .

mr blair told them : " i just want you to know how grateful we are for the work you are doing here . "
he said they were helping to build democracy and they could return home when iraqi forces were up to strength .
mr blair was upbeat about troop withdrawal in 2006 but did not set any timetable , said the bbc 's james landale who was travelling with him .
troop withdrawal the prime minister said the situation had " changed completely " since he visited iraq last year and that it was the government 's intention to " draw down our forces " .
" he -lrb- tony blair -rrb- and his officials have been more upbeat about the possibility of beginning the process of withdrawing the troops from iraq , " mr landale said .
he said mr blair rejected setting an artificial deadline , but said what he failed to do was " dismiss out of hand " remarks by a uk general a few weeks ago that troops could start to be withdrawn in six months time .
mr blair said : " it all depends on the mission being fulfilled ... this is to have the political process completed and building up the iraqi capabilities ... "
he added : " but there 's no reason ... if everything goes to plan ... we want to draw down our forces , we do not want to keep people here any longer than we need to . "
the important thing is to try and help this country become the democracy its people want it to be tony blair call for new iraqi election mr blair 's spokesman said no consideration could be taken about troop numbers until at least after the new government had been formed and the spring provincial elections are held in iraq .
us defense secretary donald rumsfeld is also making an unannounced visit to iraq to meet military commanders and troops .
mr rumsfeld flew to baghdad from afghanistan , amid signs washington is planning further troop cuts .
his arrival in iraq came as sunni arab and secular parties in iraq threaten to boycott the country 's new parliament , complaining that last week 's elections were marred by fraud .
mr blair , whose visit had been kept secret , touched down in basra in an raf hercules from kuwait .
he then transferred by helicopter to the shaiba logistics base , where he addressed some of the 4,000 troops based there from the back of a low-loader truck .
he told them : " i know it 's particularly tough being away from your families at christmas and new year .
" i just want you to know how grateful we are for the work you are doing here .
however tough it is , i hope you have some sense of how important it is . "
democracy he said 10 million iraqis had voted in recent elections .
" the important thing is to try and help this country become the democracy its people want it to be , " mr blair told the troops .
that would be done by providing the security which allowed the iraqi forces to build up their own strength " and then of course we can eventually draw down our own capability " .
" the importance of this is probably greater today than it has ever been , " said mr blair .
" because , if iraq does stabilise and become a democracy , then the region is more safe , our own country is more safe , because international terrorism will have been dealt a huge blow .
" if we manage to defeat the terrorism here , we will have dealt it a blow worldwide .
i know how dangerous it is sometimes , because we have lost good colleagues here - and it is tough , i know , sometimes . "

swiss researchers found using the instrument for 25 minutes a day helped people with sleep apnoea , the british medical journal reported .
the disorder causes the throat to close and breathing to stop , waking the patient , but the sessions helped by strengthening the airways .
uk experts said such exercising of the airways was known to help .
about 5 % of the population has the syndrome , which can cause people to wake up regularly during the night , and common advice from doctors is to lose weight . "
exercising the airways in such a way is known to help people with this condition " neil stanley , sleep expert but the team , from the zuercher hoehenklinik wald hospital , decided to investigate whether playing the aboriginal wind instrument helped patients after hearing reports that it had solved some sleep-related problems .
the team identified 25 people with sleep apnoea and split them into two groups - one which was given daily lessons for four months , while the other was kept on a waiting list for lessons .
patients who had lessons reported less sleepiness during the day and their partners said there were less disturbances .
lead researcher otto braendli said larger trials were needed to confirm the findings , but said the study offered hope .
" our results are the first to show that training the upper airways significantly improves sleep related outcomes . "
university of surrey sleep expert neil stanley said : " exercising the airways in such a way is known to help people with this condition .
" there have been reports that people who have done singing have benefited in a similar way .
however , most doctors would advise people to lose weight . "
