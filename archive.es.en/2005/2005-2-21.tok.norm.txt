" this is an important success , " talat told reporters . his party 's showing was a significant advance on the last polls in december 2003 in which it emerged the largest with 35.2 percent of the vote but was forced to form a coalition with the more nationalist democrat party of serdar denktash , son of veteran hardline leader rauf denktash . but the final results still gave his party just 24 of the 50 seats in parliament , two short of a majority , again forcing it to form a coalition . but a 5.8 percent showing for another smaller pro-un plan faction , the peace and democracy party , gave it one mp , offering talat the possibility of a more dovish coalition partner . olive branch to greek cypriots he immediately held out an olive branch to cyprus president tassos papadopoulos , whose majority greek cypriot community overwhelming rejected the un reunification blueprint at his urging in a referendum last april , saying the election result showed the turkish cypriots ' continuing desire for a solution . " i want to call on the greek cypriot side leadership to take our hand , which we are extending in peace to them and we will continue to put our best effort for reconciliation and a solution to the cyprus problem , " he said . talat called on the international community to make good on its promises to reward the turkish cypriot yes vote in last year 's referendum by easing the economic isolation of the breakaway state declared in 1983 but recognized only by ankara . " it is not up to me but up to the international community to help us end the isolation , " he said .
" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

but while the main rival , the conservative cdu managed to gain five percent it seems that may not be enough – and all eyes are now on the party of the state ’ s tiny minority of danes in germany who is emerging as the key player . the ssw party representing schleswig-holstein ‘ s danish minority , will become kingmakers after sundays elections – which developed into a cliffhanger as counting went on well into monday morning .
the danish ssw has won two seats , but if they make true their pledge of support for the red-green coalition this could give them a lead of one seat over the opposition . this would then allow the state 's premier , heide simonis , to remain in office of the northern which she has ruled for the past 12 years .
the spd won the decisive election precinct by just 70 votes . cdu still pleased the conservative cdu and their liberal allies are still pleased with their own showing . the cdu emerged the strongest party with about 40 percent of the vote .
this success is a major boost to party leader angela merkel and her bid for the candidacy in the race for chancellor in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " it ’ s a sensational result and it shows that a strong campaign and unity in the party are paying off , " merkel said .
" it ’ s also a clear signal that the red-green government both at regional and national level is reaching its end .
there is only one state left where the social democrats can rule on their own .
but we will win this state of north-rhine westaphalia in may as well . " disappointment for the spd while it seems that the social democrat led government has scraped through in schleswig-holstein , the outcome was still a disappointment to the spd .
only three months ago opinion polls had predicted a clear victory . nevertheless , party leader franz müntefering sad he saw a silver lining - claiming the party has begun to recover after suffering a string of even worse batterings in state polls last year . " i ’ m convinced this election is also a sign that the social democrats have passed the valley of tears , " he said .
" we have seen the low point last autumn and are now heading towards new victories . " greens survive scandal after strong gains in eastern german state elections last september , the far-right npd party failed to make the 5 percent threshold needed to enter parliament .
the greens ' party leader claudia roth said this is , however , no reason to let up in the fight against the neo-nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " i ’ m very relieved that the voters have shown the red card to the neo-nazis , " she said .
" but this is of course no reason to slow efforts to curb the resurgence of right-wing and anti-semitic sentiments . " with about 6 percent the greens were able to win as many votes as 5 years ago – and that in spite of the scandal over unchecked immigration currently engulfing their charismatic figurehead , german foreign minister joschka fischer . the liberals slumped slightly to 6.6 percent .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters will get as close to the centre as they can why not indeed ?
the protest initiative " not welcome , mr bush " , which is planning a massive demonstration on wednesday , says the official reason for selecting mainz was that the us premier wanted a " cosy atmosphere " for his talks with chancellor schröder .
but with between five and ten thousand protesters expected to gather in the rhineland city on wednesday , the organisers hope to shatter any such illusion .
" although this will be a peaceful demonstration , we want bush to know that we do n't approve of his policies and that we do n't approve of visits like this one , " andreas atzl , spokesman for " not welcome , mr bush " , said .
atzl has been in close contact with both the police and the city in the run up to next week 's protest action .
at one stage his initiative was offered the use of public buildings as overnight accommodation for protesters from far-flung places .
but with just days to go , the offer was withdrawn without reason .
" it 's crazy because it would not only have helped us out by enabling demonstrators to arrive a day earlier , but would have eased the burden of traffic trying to get into the city on the actual day of the visit .

but that is putting it mildly .
in reality , the visit , which will last for just six hours , has triggered the largest-scale security operation the rhineland-palatinate police authorities have ever known .
come next wednesday , the weeks of us-german co-ordinated planning will be put into effect as highways and schools are closed , public transport is diverted and river and air traffic is suspended .
in short , the city will grind to a temporary standstill as the security circus , which involves thousands of police from all over the country , hogs the limelight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not even the public drains are left open to chance reinhard rothgerber , spokesman for the trier police department has been drafted in to help stem the flood of press enquiries in mainz .
" it is not just a matter of having police officers there on the day , there is so much to be done beforehand , from dealing with the media to increasing the number of officers on the beat checking for potential problems ahead of the visit , " rothgerber said .
justifiable fuss ?
bush is not the first high-profile american to cross the city limits . indeed , he is following in the footsteps of both bill clinton and his own father , bush senior .
so what , many citizens are asking , is all the fuss about ?
" george bush is considered to be at serious risk of attack , and it is our job to make sure that nothing happens to him , " rothgerber said .
but the cost of such determination on the part of the german authorities is causing considerable consternation among the locals , almost all of whom will be affected in one way or another .
parts of the inner city will only be open to those who live there , although even they will have to show their id cards to be allowed any kind of freedom of movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worshippers will have to wait til nightfall to say their prayers it will be a pain in the purse for many shop and restaurant owners in cordoned off areas . although they can officially set about business as usual if their paperwork in order , the streets will be largely devoid of one crucial component : customers .
enforced holiday many people have decided to take the day off , although they do n't feel they should have to .
that is also the stance taken by the service industry union , verdi , which officially advised its members not to cash in any time in lieu for a day off in the name of the us presidential visit , but to simply warn their superiors of the delays and difficulties they are likely to encounter in getting to work .
the police have set up a hotline for residents who want to know how they can move about next wednesday .
it opened on monday , and has been receiving between 3,000 and 3,500 calls daily .

" together we can once again set history on a hopeful course , " he said , urging the eu to help reconstruct iraq , adding that he wanted to work in partnership with a united europe . in a move aimed at easing transatlantic tensions during bush 's visit , on monday eu foreign ministers approved a plan to train 770 senior iraqi police officers and judges in the eu and in countries near iraq .
the mission is due to start in mid-2005 and could be extended to iraq if the security situation on the ground there improves . iran and middle east during his speech in brussels , the us leader also addressed the issue of iran , which has made many europeans uneasy since there are fears that the us might also be considering using force to make iran give up its nuclear ambitions . he left open the possibility of military action there , although he emphasized a diplomatic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in safeguarding the security of free nations , no option can be taken permanently off the table .
iran , however , is different from iraq .
we 're in the early stages of diplomacy , " he said . the dispute over iran 's nuclear program has seen the eu and the us take different approaches .
britain , france and germany have been negotiating with the islamic republic to try to bring its nuclear activities into the framework of un guidelines .
the three have preferred a carrot-and-stick approach , promising trade accords in return for tehran 's renouncement of nuclear power . on the other hand , us officials , who claim tehran wants to use its nuclear program to develop atomic weapons , are pushing for iran to be taken before the un security council .
europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons . bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . message to putin russia was also a topic in the speech , reflecting concern by western nations that the country led by vladimir putin is drifting toward authoritarianism .
bush will meet with putin on thursday in bratislava , the capital of slovakia . bush said the us supports membership for russia in the world trade organization , but that " for russia to make progress as a european nation , the russian government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . " he added that the us and eu should put reform at the heart of their dialogue with russia , saying that reform will not happen overnight . reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush meets with french president jacques chirac in brussels on monday much of bush 's time during his european trip will be spent with leaders who opposed his iraq policy , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and putin . bush tried to play down their rifts , calling them a " temporary debate " and a " passing disagreement of governments . " eu trade commission peter mandelson , in reacting to bush 's speech , called it an " evolution of american policy , " saying the us had learned it was better to work with and through allies . still , there were no apologies for either side on the us-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" the time has come to draw a line under the tensions of the recent past , " said verhofstadt while introducing bush .

but that is putting it mildly .
in reality , the visit , which will last for just six hours , has triggered the largest-scale security operation the rhineland-palatinate police authorities have ever known .
come next wednesday , the weeks of us-german co-ordinated planning will be put into effect as highways and schools are closed , public transport is diverted and river and air traffic is suspended .
in short , the city will grind to a temporary standstill as the security circus , which involves thousands of police from all over the country , hogs the limelight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not even the public drains are left open to chance reinhard rothgerber , spokesman for the trier police department has been drafted in to help stem the flood of press enquiries in mainz .
" it is not just a matter of having police officers there on the day , there is so much to be done beforehand , from dealing with the media to increasing the number of officers on the beat checking for potential problems ahead of the visit , " rothgerber said .
justifiable fuss ?
bush is not the first high-profile american to cross the city limits . indeed , he is following in the footsteps of both bill clinton and his own father , bush senior .
so what , many citizens are asking , is all the fuss about ?
" george bush is considered to be at serious risk of attack , and it is our job to make sure that nothing happens to him , " rothgerber said .
but the cost of such determination on the part of the german authorities is causing considerable consternation among the locals , almost all of whom will be affected in one way or another .
parts of the inner city will only be open to those who live there , although even they will have to show their id cards to be allowed any kind of freedom of movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worshippers will have to wait til nightfall to say their prayers it will be a pain in the purse for many shop and restaurant owners in cordoned off areas . although they can officially set about business as usual if their paperwork in order , the streets will be largely devoid of one crucial component : customers .
enforced holiday many people have decided to take the day off , although they do n't feel they should have to .
that is also the stance taken by the service industry union , verdi , which officially advised its members not to cash in any time in lieu for a day off in the name of the us presidential visit , but to simply warn their superiors of the delays and difficulties they are likely to encounter in getting to work .
the police have set up a hotline for residents who want to know how they can move about next wednesday .
it opened on monday , and has been receiving between 3,000 and 3,500 calls daily .
katrin henrik lives in the city centre , but has to travel to get to her job just out of town .
" it looks like i will have to take the day off because with the highways closed , there is no way to get there .
it 's ridiculous , " she said .
" not welcome , mr bush " this restriction of movement begs a valid question .
" if the president has such massive security needs , then why choose a city like mainz as his destination ?
why not have him go to a more remote place , where fewer people would be affected ? "
mainz citizen , peter zenke asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters will get as close to the centre as they can why not indeed ?
the protest initiative " not welcome , mr bush " , which is planning a massive demonstration on wednesday , says the official reason for selecting mainz was that the us premier wanted a " cosy atmosphere " for his talks with chancellor schröder .
but with between five and ten thousand protesters expected to gather in the rhineland city on wednesday , the organisers hope to shatter any such illusion .
" although this will be a peaceful demonstration , we want bush to know that we do n't approve of his policies and that we do n't approve of visits like this one , " andreas atzl , spokesman for " not welcome , mr bush " , said .
atzl has been in close contact with both the police and the city in the run up to next week 's protest action .
at one stage his initiative was offered the use of public buildings as overnight accommodation for protesters from far-flung places .
but with just days to go , the offer was withdrawn without reason .
" it 's crazy because it would not only have helped us out by enabling demonstrators to arrive a day earlier , but would have eased the burden of traffic trying to get into the city on the actual day of the visit .
i guess the mayor just does n't want the protests , " atzl stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiers are expected to meet at electors palace indeed the city is making quite something of the visit as a way of upping mainz 's profile on the world map .
" the upcoming visit is both an important event , and an opportunity for us to become an attractive economic and tourist location , " said mainz 's deputy mayor , norbert schüler .
" it is advertising for our city and it can not be too highly valued . "
that , atzl believes , is as maybe , " but it 's an absurd price to pay for a bit of publicity , and even worse for a visit in which the two premiers are not even likely to address the issues which matter .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2005 much ado about bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even cycling in central mainz will be a problem on wednesday president bush 's impending visit to the german city of mainz is being heralded as a chance for berlin and washington to mend fences , but for many residents in the rhineland city , it 's just an unwanted inconvenience . in a statement released by the mainz police authorities earlier this week , the president 's upcoming visit was described as a " great challenge " .
but that is putting it mildly .
in reality , the visit , which will last for just six hours , has triggered the largest-scale security operation the rhineland-palatinate police authorities have ever known .
come next wednesday , the weeks of us-german co-ordinated planning will be put into effect as highways and schools are closed , public transport is diverted and river and air traffic is suspended .
in short , the city will grind to a temporary standstill as the security circus , which involves thousands of police from all over the country , hogs the limelight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not even the public drains are left open to chance reinhard rothgerber , spokesman for the trier police department has been drafted in to help stem the flood of press enquiries in mainz .
" it is not just a matter of having police officers there on the day , there is so much to be done beforehand , from dealing with the media to increasing the number of officers on the beat checking for potential problems ahead of the visit , " rothgerber said .
justifiable fuss ?
bush is not the first high-profile american to cross the city limits . indeed , he is following in the footsteps of both bill clinton and his own father , bush senior .
so what , many citizens are asking , is all the fuss about ?
" george bush is considered to be at serious risk of attack , and it is our job to make sure that nothing happens to him , " rothgerber said .
but the cost of such determination on the part of the german authorities is causing considerable consternation among the locals , almost all of whom will be affected in one way or another .
parts of the inner city will only be open to those who live there , although even they will have to show their id cards to be allowed any kind of freedom of movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worshippers will have to wait til nightfall to say their prayers it will be a pain in the purse for many shop and restaurant owners in cordoned off areas . although they can officially set about business as usual if their paperwork in order , the streets will be largely devoid of one crucial component : customers .
enforced holiday many people have decided to take the day off , although they do n't feel they should have to .
that is also the stance taken by the service industry union , verdi , which officially advised its members not to cash in any time in lieu for a day off in the name of the us presidential visit , but to simply warn their superiors of the delays and difficulties they are likely to encounter in getting to work .
the police have set up a hotline for residents who want to know how they can move about next wednesday .
it opened on monday , and has been receiving between 3,000 and 3,500 calls daily .
katrin henrik lives in the city centre , but has to travel to get to her job just out of town .
" it looks like i will have to take the day off because with the highways closed , there is no way to get there .
it 's ridiculous , " she said .
" not welcome , mr bush " this restriction of movement begs a valid question .
" if the president has such massive security needs , then why choose a city like mainz as his destination ?
why not have him go to a more remote place , where fewer people would be affected ? "
mainz citizen , peter zenke asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters will get as close to the centre as they can why not indeed ?
the protest initiative " not welcome , mr bush " , which is planning a massive demonstration on wednesday , says the official reason for selecting mainz was that the us premier wanted a " cosy atmosphere " for his talks with chancellor schröder .
but with between five and ten thousand protesters expected to gather in the rhineland city on wednesday , the organisers hope to shatter any such illusion .
" although this will be a peaceful demonstration , we want bush to know that we do n't approve of his policies and that we do n't approve of visits like this one , " andreas atzl , spokesman for " not welcome , mr bush " , said .
atzl has been in close contact with both the police and the city in the run up to next week 's protest action .
at one stage his initiative was offered the use of public buildings as overnight accommodation for protesters from far-flung places .
but with just days to go , the offer was withdrawn without reason .
" it 's crazy because it would not only have helped us out by enabling demonstrators to arrive a day earlier , but would have eased the burden of traffic trying to get into the city on the actual day of the visit .
i guess the mayor just does n't want the protests , " atzl stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiers are expected to meet at electors palace indeed the city is making quite something of the visit as a way of upping mainz 's profile on the world map .
" the upcoming visit is both an important event , and an opportunity for us to become an attractive economic and tourist location , " said mainz 's deputy mayor , norbert schüler .
" it is advertising for our city and it can not be too highly valued . "
that , atzl believes , is as maybe , " but it 's an absurd price to pay for a bit of publicity , and even worse for a visit in which the two premiers are not even likely to address the issues which matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2005 much ado about bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even cycling in central mainz will be a problem on wednesday president bush 's impending visit to the german city of mainz is being heralded as a chance for berlin and washington to mend fences , but for many residents in the rhineland city , it 's just an unwanted inconvenience . in a statement released by the mainz police authorities earlier this week , the president 's upcoming visit was described as a " great challenge " .
but that is putting it mildly .
in reality , the visit , which will last for just six hours , has triggered the largest-scale security operation the rhineland-palatinate police authorities have ever known .
come next wednesday , the weeks of us-german co-ordinated planning will be put into effect as highways and schools are closed , public transport is diverted and river and air traffic is suspended .
in short , the city will grind to a temporary standstill as the security circus , which involves thousands of police from all over the country , hogs the limelight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not even the public drains are left open to chance reinhard rothgerber , spokesman for the trier police department has been drafted in to help stem the flood of press enquiries in mainz .
" it is not just a matter of having police officers there on the day , there is so much to be done beforehand , from dealing with the media to increasing the number of officers on the beat checking for potential problems ahead of the visit , " rothgerber said .
justifiable fuss ?
bush is not the first high-profile american to cross the city limits . indeed , he is following in the footsteps of both bill clinton and his own father , bush senior .
so what , many citizens are asking , is all the fuss about ?
" george bush is considered to be at serious risk of attack , and it is our job to make sure that nothing happens to him , " rothgerber said .
but the cost of such determination on the part of the german authorities is causing considerable consternation among the locals , almost all of whom will be affected in one way or another .
parts of the inner city will only be open to those who live there , although even they will have to show their id cards to be allowed any kind of freedom of movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worshippers will have to wait til nightfall to say their prayers it will be a pain in the purse for many shop and restaurant owners in cordoned off areas . although they can officially set about business as usual if their paperwork in order , the streets will be largely devoid of one crucial component : customers .
enforced holiday many people have decided to take the day off , although they do n't feel they should have to .
that is also the stance taken by the service industry union , verdi , which officially advised its members not to cash in any time in lieu for a day off in the name of the us presidential visit , but to simply warn their superiors of the delays and difficulties they are likely to encounter in getting to work .
the police have set up a hotline for residents who want to know how they can move about next wednesday .
it opened on monday , and has been receiving between 3,000 and 3,500 calls daily .
katrin henrik lives in the city centre , but has to travel to get to her job just out of town .
" it looks like i will have to take the day off because with the highways closed , there is no way to get there .
it 's ridiculous , " she said .
" not welcome , mr bush " this restriction of movement begs a valid question .
" if the president has such massive security needs , then why choose a city like mainz as his destination ?
why not have him go to a more remote place , where fewer people would be affected ? "
mainz citizen , peter zenke asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters will get as close to the centre as they can why not indeed ?
the protest initiative " not welcome , mr bush " , which is planning a massive demonstration on wednesday , says the official reason for selecting mainz was that the us premier wanted a " cosy atmosphere " for his talks with chancellor schröder .
but with between five and ten thousand protesters expected to gather in the rhineland city on wednesday , the organisers hope to shatter any such illusion .
" although this will be a peaceful demonstration , we want bush to know that we do n't approve of his policies and that we do n't approve of visits like this one , " andreas atzl , spokesman for " not welcome , mr bush " , said .
atzl has been in close contact with both the police and the city in the run up to next week 's protest action .
at one stage his initiative was offered the use of public buildings as overnight accommodation for protesters from far-flung places .
but with just days to go , the offer was withdrawn without reason .
" it 's crazy because it would not only have helped us out by enabling demonstrators to arrive a day earlier , but would have eased the burden of traffic trying to get into the city on the actual day of the visit .
i guess the mayor just does n't want the protests , " atzl stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiers are expected to meet at electors palace indeed the city is making quite something of the visit as a way of upping mainz 's profile on the world map .
" the upcoming visit is both an important event , and an opportunity for us to become an attractive economic and tourist location , " said mainz 's deputy mayor , norbert schüler .
" it is advertising for our city and it can not be too highly valued . "
that , atzl believes , is as maybe , " but it 's an absurd price to pay for a bit of publicity , and even worse for a visit in which the two premiers are not even likely to address the issues which matter . " tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mainz to lock down for bush visit tight security measures are being put into place for george w. bush 's stop in the city of mainz next week during his european tour .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

but the cost of such determination on the part of the german authorities is causing considerable consternation among the locals , almost all of whom will be affected in one way or another .
parts of the inner city will only be open to those who live there , although even they will have to show their id cards to be allowed any kind of freedom of movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worshippers will have to wait til nightfall to say their prayers it will be a pain in the purse for many shop and restaurant owners in cordoned off areas . although they can officially set about business as usual if their paperwork in order , the streets will be largely devoid of one crucial component : customers .
enforced holiday many people have decided to take the day off , although they do n't feel they should have to .
that is also the stance taken by the service industry union , verdi , which officially advised its members not to cash in any time in lieu for a day off in the name of the us presidential visit , but to simply warn their superiors of the delays and difficulties they are likely to encounter in getting to work .
the police have set up a hotline for residents who want to know how they can move about next wednesday .
it opened on monday , and has been receiving between 3,000 and 3,500 calls daily .
katrin henrik lives in the city centre , but has to travel to get to her job just out of town .
" it looks like i will have to take the day off because with the highways closed , there is no way to get there .
it 's ridiculous , " she said .
" not welcome , mr bush " this restriction of movement begs a valid question .
" if the president has such massive security needs , then why choose a city like mainz as his destination ?
why not have him go to a more remote place , where fewer people would be affected ? "
mainz citizen , peter zenke asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters will get as close to the centre as they can why not indeed ?
the protest initiative " not welcome , mr bush " , which is planning a massive demonstration on wednesday , says the official reason for selecting mainz was that the us premier wanted a " cosy atmosphere " for his talks with chancellor schröder .
but with between five and ten thousand protesters expected to gather in the rhineland city on wednesday , the organisers hope to shatter any such illusion .
" although this will be a peaceful demonstration , we want bush to know that we do n't approve of his policies and that we do n't approve of visits like this one , " andreas atzl , spokesman for " not welcome , mr bush " , said .
atzl has been in close contact with both the police and the city in the run up to next week 's protest action .
at one stage his initiative was offered the use of public buildings as overnight accommodation for protesters from far-flung places .
but with just days to go , the offer was withdrawn without reason .
" it 's crazy because it would not only have helped us out by enabling demonstrators to arrive a day earlier , but would have eased the burden of traffic trying to get into the city on the actual day of the visit .
i guess the mayor just does n't want the protests , " atzl stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiers are expected to meet at electors palace indeed the city is making quite something of the visit as a way of upping mainz 's profile on the world map .
" the upcoming visit is both an important event , and an opportunity for us to become an attractive economic and tourist location , " said mainz 's deputy mayor , norbert schüler .
" it is advertising for our city and it can not be too highly valued . "
that , atzl believes , is as maybe , " but it 's an absurd price to pay for a bit of publicity , and even worse for a visit in which the two premiers are not even likely to address the issues which matter .

the spd won the decisive election precinct by just 70 votes . cdu still pleased the conservative cdu and their liberal allies are still pleased with their own showing . the cdu emerged the strongest party with about 40 percent of the vote .

the danish ssw has won two seats , but if they make true their pledge of support for the red-green coalition this could give them a lead of one seat over the opposition . this would then allow the state 's premier , heide simonis , to remain in office of the northern which she has ruled for the past 12 years .
the spd won the decisive election precinct by just 70 votes . cdu still pleased the conservative cdu and their liberal allies are still pleased with their own showing . the cdu emerged the strongest party with about 40 percent of the vote .
this success is a major boost to party leader angela merkel and her bid for the candidacy in the race for chancellor in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " it ’ s a sensational result and it shows that a strong campaign and unity in the party are paying off , " merkel said .

" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

" now is the time for us to set aside differences and to move forward , " bush said before leaving washington for a five-day trip to europe where he plans to focus on emphasizing the " strong friendship " with europe . on monday , the us president was to meet with european union and nato leaders in brussels , where he will give a keynote speech stressing " a new era of transatlantic unity " and continued cooperation on issues like iran and the middle east peace process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush last visited germany on may 23 , 2002 when he met with chancellor schröder in berlin .
as bush 's first overseas trip of his second term , the european visit , which will also include bi-lateral meetings with french president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , is intended to set the tone for a new working relationship after europe and the us drifted apart over the iraq war . looking towards the middle east " as past debates fade , and great duties become clear , let us begin a new era of transatlantic unity , " bush was due to announce to his european counterparts , many of whom such as chirac and schröder have been critical of washington 's " go-it-alone " foreign policy in iraq and the middle east . diplomats in brussels have suggested the eu would press the us leader for substantive progress on the middle east " roadmap " following the election of a new palestinian leadership and its declaration of a truce with israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe calls for bush to work closer with sharon and abbas in bringing about peace for the middle east .
-lrb- archive photo from june 4 , 2003 -rrb- according to an advance copy of his speech , bush was to say that ending the israeli-palestinian conflict was " our immediate goal , " and give strong words of praise and support for the efforts of the european union . " america supports a strong europe because we need a strong partner in the hard work of advancing freedom in the world , " said the speech , in which bush made spreading democracy a central pillar of his second four-year term in the white house . " our strong friendship is essential to peace and prosperity across the globe – and no temporary debate , no passing disagreement of governments , no power on earth will ever divide us , " the president was due to say . question of iran one issue likely to feature high on the agenda of both eu leaders and bush is the escalation in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .
eu heavyweights britain , france and germany have been negotiating with the islamic republic to try to bring its nuclear activities into the framework of un guidelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian and eu officials met dec .
13 , 2004 to discuss trade cooperation and tehran 's nuclear program .
us officials , on the other hand , are pushing for iran to be hauled before the un security council , claiming tehran is covering up the development of nuclear weapons .
the europeans prefer a carrot-and-stick approach coupling nuclear compliance with the promise of a lucrative new trade accord for iran . europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons .
bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . bush will most likely not dwell on these differences or on the fact that the us opposes a european plan to lift an embargo on arms sales to china .
instead he will concentrate on demonstrating cooperative spirit . " today , america and europe face a moment of consequence and opportunity , " he will say .
" together we can once again set history on a hopeful course .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .

he also urged cooperation on iran and the middle east and urged russia to renew its commitment to democracy . it is bush 's first overseas trip since the beginning of his second term in office and during his speech before an audience in the 19th century concert noble hall , he struck a note that was more conciliatory than the go-it-alone attitude prevalent during his first term that was widely criticized by european leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is escorted by prime minister guy verhofstadt of belgium to deliver a foreign policy speech at the concert noble ballroom in brussels .
" together we can once again set history on a hopeful course , " he said , urging the eu to help reconstruct iraq , adding that he wanted to work in partnership with a united europe . in a move aimed at easing transatlantic tensions during bush 's visit , on monday eu foreign ministers approved a plan to train 770 senior iraqi police officers and judges in the eu and in countries near iraq .
the mission is due to start in mid-2005 and could be extended to iraq if the security situation on the ground there improves . iran and middle east during his speech in brussels , the us leader also addressed the issue of iran , which has made many europeans uneasy since there are fears that the us might also be considering using force to make iran give up its nuclear ambitions . he left open the possibility of military action there , although he emphasized a diplomatic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in safeguarding the security of free nations , no option can be taken permanently off the table .
iran , however , is different from iraq .
we 're in the early stages of diplomacy , " he said . the dispute over iran 's nuclear program has seen the eu and the us take different approaches .
britain , france and germany have been negotiating with the islamic republic to try to bring its nuclear activities into the framework of un guidelines .
the three have preferred a carrot-and-stick approach , promising trade accords in return for tehran 's renouncement of nuclear power . on the other hand , us officials , who claim tehran wants to use its nuclear program to develop atomic weapons , are pushing for iran to be taken before the un security council .
europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons . bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . message to putin russia was also a topic in the speech , reflecting concern by western nations that the country led by vladimir putin is drifting toward authoritarianism .
bush will meet with putin on thursday in bratislava , the capital of slovakia . bush said the us supports membership for russia in the world trade organization , but that " for russia to make progress as a european nation , the russian government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . " he added that the us and eu should put reform at the heart of their dialogue with russia , saying that reform will not happen overnight . reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush meets with french president jacques chirac in brussels on monday much of bush 's time during his european trip will be spent with leaders who opposed his iraq policy , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and putin . bush tried to play down their rifts , calling them a " temporary debate " and a " passing disagreement of governments . " eu trade commission peter mandelson , in reacting to bush 's speech , called it an " evolution of american policy , " saying the us had learned it was better to work with and through allies . still , there were no apologies for either side on the us-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" the time has come to draw a line under the tensions of the recent past , " said verhofstadt while introducing bush .

he also urged cooperation on iran and the middle east and urged russia to renew its commitment to democracy . it is bush 's first overseas trip since the beginning of his second term in office and during his speech before an audience in the 19th century concert noble hall , he struck a note that was more conciliatory than the go-it-alone attitude prevalent during his first term that was widely criticized by european leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is escorted by prime minister guy verhofstadt of belgium to deliver a foreign policy speech at the concert noble ballroom in brussels .
" together we can once again set history on a hopeful course , " he said , urging the eu to help reconstruct iraq , adding that he wanted to work in partnership with a united europe . in a move aimed at easing transatlantic tensions during bush 's visit , on monday eu foreign ministers approved a plan to train 770 senior iraqi police officers and judges in the eu and in countries near iraq .
the mission is due to start in mid-2005 and could be extended to iraq if the security situation on the ground there improves . iran and middle east during his speech in brussels , the us leader also addressed the issue of iran , which has made many europeans uneasy since there are fears that the us might also be considering using force to make iran give up its nuclear ambitions . he left open the possibility of military action there , although he emphasized a diplomatic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in safeguarding the security of free nations , no option can be taken permanently off the table .
iran , however , is different from iraq .
we 're in the early stages of diplomacy , " he said . the dispute over iran 's nuclear program has seen the eu and the us take different approaches .
britain , france and germany have been negotiating with the islamic republic to try to bring its nuclear activities into the framework of un guidelines .
the three have preferred a carrot-and-stick approach , promising trade accords in return for tehran 's renouncement of nuclear power . on the other hand , us officials , who claim tehran wants to use its nuclear program to develop atomic weapons , are pushing for iran to be taken before the un security council .
europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons . bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . message to putin russia was also a topic in the speech , reflecting concern by western nations that the country led by vladimir putin is drifting toward authoritarianism .
bush will meet with putin on thursday in bratislava , the capital of slovakia . bush said the us supports membership for russia in the world trade organization , but that " for russia to make progress as a european nation , the russian government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . " he added that the us and eu should put reform at the heart of their dialogue with russia , saying that reform will not happen overnight . reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush meets with french president jacques chirac in brussels on monday much of bush 's time during his european trip will be spent with leaders who opposed his iraq policy , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and putin . bush tried to play down their rifts , calling them a " temporary debate " and a " passing disagreement of governments . " eu trade commission peter mandelson , in reacting to bush 's speech , called it an " evolution of american policy , " saying the us had learned it was better to work with and through allies . still , there were no apologies for either side on the us-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" the time has come to draw a line under the tensions of the recent past , " said verhofstadt while introducing bush .
" it makes little sense to continue arguing about who was right and who was wrong .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .
german carmaker audi produces its tt sports wagon there , the hungarian phone company matav , once state owned , has long been a part of deutsche telekom .
other well-known german multinationals , such as eon , bosch and commerzbank , have made names for themselves in hungary . foreign investment : essential at a conference on monday in bonn , heads of state of both countries , prime minister gyurcsany and german chancellor gerhard schröder , gathered with about 350 firms to talk about what the future economic landscape in hungary might look like and whether it can continue the rapid pace of growth and investment it has enjoyed over the last decade and a half . schröder called on german firms to continue investing abroad , including hungary .
he said the fact that germany was so dependent on exports - one of the few motors driving the economy forward - foreign investment was essential . " it secures access to markets that we otherwise would n't have , " he told conference participants .
" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .
its eastern neighbors , such as romania and ukraine , are increasingly attracting investors - that might have once considered hungary - due to their lower wages and tax rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of budapest celebrates hungary 's eu referendum with fireworks on saturday night , april 12 , 2003 , in front of the historical chain bridge and the royal caste of budapest .
hungary will decide whether to join the european union in this referendum .
even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .
finnish mobile phone giant nokia also wants to invest more in hungary in the future . that is reflected in its healthy growth rate .
in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people . " it seems that a large portion of the country did n't even notice that we joined , " he told german television .
or if they did , he added , it was because " whisky was suddenly cheaper . " gerwald herter -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .
german carmaker audi produces its tt sports wagon there , the hungarian phone company matav , once state owned , has long been a part of deutsche telekom .
other well-known german multinationals , such as eon , bosch and commerzbank , have made names for themselves in hungary . foreign investment : essential at a conference on monday in bonn , heads of state of both countries , prime minister gyurcsany and german chancellor gerhard schröder , gathered with about 350 firms to talk about what the future economic landscape in hungary might look like and whether it can continue the rapid pace of growth and investment it has enjoyed over the last decade and a half . schröder called on german firms to continue investing abroad , including hungary .
he said the fact that germany was so dependent on exports - one of the few motors driving the economy forward - foreign investment was essential . " it secures access to markets that we otherwise would n't have , " he told conference participants .
" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .
its eastern neighbors , such as romania and ukraine , are increasingly attracting investors - that might have once considered hungary - due to their lower wages and tax rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of budapest celebrates hungary 's eu referendum with fireworks on saturday night , april 12 , 2003 , in front of the historical chain bridge and the royal caste of budapest .
hungary will decide whether to join the european union in this referendum .
even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .
finnish mobile phone giant nokia also wants to invest more in hungary in the future . that is reflected in its healthy growth rate .
in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people . " it seems that a large portion of the country did n't even notice that we joined , " he told german television .
or if they did , he added , it was because " whisky was suddenly cheaper . " gerwald herter -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

he also urged cooperation on iran and the middle east and urged russia to renew its commitment to democracy . it is bush 's first overseas trip since the beginning of his second term in office and during his speech before an audience in the 19th century concert noble hall , he struck a note that was more conciliatory than the go-it-alone attitude prevalent during his first term that was widely criticized by european leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is escorted by prime minister guy verhofstadt of belgium to deliver a foreign policy speech at the concert noble ballroom in brussels .
" together we can once again set history on a hopeful course , " he said , urging the eu to help reconstruct iraq , adding that he wanted to work in partnership with a united europe . in a move aimed at easing transatlantic tensions during bush 's visit , on monday eu foreign ministers approved a plan to train 770 senior iraqi police officers and judges in the eu and in countries near iraq .
the mission is due to start in mid-2005 and could be extended to iraq if the security situation on the ground there improves . iran and middle east during his speech in brussels , the us leader also addressed the issue of iran , which has made many europeans uneasy since there are fears that the us might also be considering using force to make iran give up its nuclear ambitions . he left open the possibility of military action there , although he emphasized a diplomatic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in safeguarding the security of free nations , no option can be taken permanently off the table .
iran , however , is different from iraq .
we 're in the early stages of diplomacy , " he said . the dispute over iran 's nuclear program has seen the eu and the us take different approaches .
britain , france and germany have been negotiating with the islamic republic to try to bring its nuclear activities into the framework of un guidelines .
the three have preferred a carrot-and-stick approach , promising trade accords in return for tehran 's renouncement of nuclear power . on the other hand , us officials , who claim tehran wants to use its nuclear program to develop atomic weapons , are pushing for iran to be taken before the un security council .
europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons . bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . message to putin russia was also a topic in the speech , reflecting concern by western nations that the country led by vladimir putin is drifting toward authoritarianism .
bush will meet with putin on thursday in bratislava , the capital of slovakia . bush said the us supports membership for russia in the world trade organization , but that " for russia to make progress as a european nation , the russian government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . " he added that the us and eu should put reform at the heart of their dialogue with russia , saying that reform will not happen overnight . reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush meets with french president jacques chirac in brussels on monday much of bush 's time during his european trip will be spent with leaders who opposed his iraq policy , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and putin . bush tried to play down their rifts , calling them a " temporary debate " and a " passing disagreement of governments . " eu trade commission peter mandelson , in reacting to bush 's speech , called it an " evolution of american policy , " saying the us had learned it was better to work with and through allies . still , there were no apologies for either side on the us-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" the time has come to draw a line under the tensions of the recent past , " said verhofstadt while introducing bush .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .

he said the fact that germany was so dependent on exports - one of the few motors driving the economy forward - foreign investment was essential . " it secures access to markets that we otherwise would n't have , " he told conference participants .
" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .

even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .
finnish mobile phone giant nokia also wants to invest more in hungary in the future . that is reflected in its healthy growth rate .
in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people . " it seems that a large portion of the country did n't even notice that we joined , " he told german television .
or if they did , he added , it was because " whisky was suddenly cheaper . " gerwald herter -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

" now is the time for us to set aside differences and to move forward , " bush said before leaving washington for a five-day trip to europe where he plans to focus on emphasizing the " strong friendship " with europe . on monday , the us president was to meet with european union and nato leaders in brussels , where he will give a keynote speech stressing " a new era of transatlantic unity " and continued cooperation on issues like iran and the middle east peace process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush last visited germany on may 23 , 2002 when he met with chancellor schröder in berlin .
as bush 's first overseas trip of his second term , the european visit , which will also include bi-lateral meetings with french president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , is intended to set the tone for a new working relationship after europe and the us drifted apart over the iraq war . looking towards the middle east " as past debates fade , and great duties become clear , let us begin a new era of transatlantic unity , " bush was due to announce to his european counterparts , many of whom such as chirac and schröder have been critical of washington 's " go-it-alone " foreign policy in iraq and the middle east . diplomats in brussels have suggested the eu would press the us leader for substantive progress on the middle east " roadmap " following the election of a new palestinian leadership and its declaration of a truce with israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe calls for bush to work closer with sharon and abbas in bringing about peace for the middle east .

" america supports a strong europe because we need a strong partner in the hard work of advancing freedom in the world , " said the speech , in which bush made spreading democracy a central pillar of his second four-year term in the white house . " our strong friendship is essential to peace and prosperity across the globe – and no temporary debate , no passing disagreement of governments , no power on earth will ever divide us , " the president was due to say . question of iran one issue likely to feature high on the agenda of both eu leaders and bush is the escalation in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

us officials , on the other hand , are pushing for iran to be hauled before the un security council , claiming tehran is covering up the development of nuclear weapons .
the europeans prefer a carrot-and-stick approach coupling nuclear compliance with the promise of a lucrative new trade accord for iran . europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons .
bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . bush will most likely not dwell on these differences or on the fact that the us opposes a european plan to lift an embargo on arms sales to china .
instead he will concentrate on demonstrating cooperative spirit . " today , america and europe face a moment of consequence and opportunity , " he will say .

khaled el-masri , who is of lebanese descent but has a german passport , claims to have been abducted by us operatives while on holiday in macedonia on dec .

three weeks later , masri said , he was put on an airplane to afghanistan , where he was shackled , punched and interrogated about extremists at his mosque in ulm , germany .

the case is being investigated by a munich prosecutor as a kidnapping case , the weekly said .
the cia allegedly whisked foreign terror suspects to clandestine interrogation facilities , using a boeing 737 plane specially dedicated for that purpose , newsweek reported sunday .

" this is an important success , " talat told reporters . his party 's showing was a significant advance on the last polls in december 2003 in which it emerged the largest with 35.2 percent of the vote but was forced to form a coalition with the more nationalist democrat party of serdar denktash , son of veteran hardline leader rauf denktash . but the final results still gave his party just 24 of the 50 seats in parliament , two short of a majority , again forcing it to form a coalition . but a 5.8 percent showing for another smaller pro-un plan faction , the peace and democracy party , gave it one mp , offering talat the possibility of a more dovish coalition partner . olive branch to greek cypriots he immediately held out an olive branch to cyprus president tassos papadopoulos , whose majority greek cypriot community overwhelming rejected the un reunification blueprint at his urging in a referendum last april , saying the election result showed the turkish cypriots ' continuing desire for a solution . " i want to call on the greek cypriot side leadership to take our hand , which we are extending in peace to them and we will continue to put our best effort for reconciliation and a solution to the cyprus problem , " he said . talat called on the international community to make good on its promises to reward the turkish cypriot yes vote in last year 's referendum by easing the economic isolation of the breakaway state declared in 1983 but recognized only by ankara . " it is not up to me but up to the international community to help us end the isolation , " he said .
" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

as bush 's first overseas trip of his second term , the european visit , which will also include bi-lateral meetings with french president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , is intended to set the tone for a new working relationship after europe and the us drifted apart over the iraq war . looking towards the middle east " as past debates fade , and great duties become clear , let us begin a new era of transatlantic unity , " bush was due to announce to his european counterparts , many of whom such as chirac and schröder have been critical of washington 's " go-it-alone " foreign policy in iraq and the middle east . diplomats in brussels have suggested the eu would press the us leader for substantive progress on the middle east " roadmap " following the election of a new palestinian leadership and its declaration of a truce with israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe calls for bush to work closer with sharon and abbas in bringing about peace for the middle east .

us officials , on the other hand , are pushing for iran to be hauled before the un security council , claiming tehran is covering up the development of nuclear weapons .
the europeans prefer a carrot-and-stick approach coupling nuclear compliance with the promise of a lucrative new trade accord for iran . europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons .
bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . bush will most likely not dwell on these differences or on the fact that the us opposes a european plan to lift an embargo on arms sales to china .
instead he will concentrate on demonstrating cooperative spirit . " today , america and europe face a moment of consequence and opportunity , " he will say .

" now is the time for us to set aside differences and to move forward , " bush said before leaving washington for a five-day trip to europe where he plans to focus on emphasizing the " strong friendship " with europe . on monday , the us president was to meet with european union and nato leaders in brussels , where he will give a keynote speech stressing " a new era of transatlantic unity " and continued cooperation on issues like iran and the middle east peace process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush last visited germany on may 23 , 2002 when he met with chancellor schröder in berlin .
as bush 's first overseas trip of his second term , the european visit , which will also include bi-lateral meetings with french president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , is intended to set the tone for a new working relationship after europe and the us drifted apart over the iraq war . looking towards the middle east " as past debates fade , and great duties become clear , let us begin a new era of transatlantic unity , " bush was due to announce to his european counterparts , many of whom such as chirac and schröder have been critical of washington 's " go-it-alone " foreign policy in iraq and the middle east . diplomats in brussels have suggested the eu would press the us leader for substantive progress on the middle east " roadmap " following the election of a new palestinian leadership and its declaration of a truce with israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe calls for bush to work closer with sharon and abbas in bringing about peace for the middle east .
-lrb- archive photo from june 4 , 2003 -rrb- according to an advance copy of his speech , bush was to say that ending the israeli-palestinian conflict was " our immediate goal , " and give strong words of praise and support for the efforts of the european union . " america supports a strong europe because we need a strong partner in the hard work of advancing freedom in the world , " said the speech , in which bush made spreading democracy a central pillar of his second four-year term in the white house . " our strong friendship is essential to peace and prosperity across the globe – and no temporary debate , no passing disagreement of governments , no power on earth will ever divide us , " the president was due to say . question of iran one issue likely to feature high on the agenda of both eu leaders and bush is the escalation in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

us officials , on the other hand , are pushing for iran to be hauled before the un security council , claiming tehran is covering up the development of nuclear weapons .
the europeans prefer a carrot-and-stick approach coupling nuclear compliance with the promise of a lucrative new trade accord for iran . europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons .
bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . bush will most likely not dwell on these differences or on the fact that the us opposes a european plan to lift an embargo on arms sales to china .
instead he will concentrate on demonstrating cooperative spirit . " today , america and europe face a moment of consequence and opportunity , " he will say .

" now is the time for us to set aside differences and to move forward , " bush said before leaving washington for a five-day trip to europe where he plans to focus on emphasizing the " strong friendship " with europe . on monday , the us president was to meet with european union and nato leaders in brussels , where he will give a keynote speech stressing " a new era of transatlantic unity " and continued cooperation on issues like iran and the middle east peace process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush last visited germany on may 23 , 2002 when he met with chancellor schröder in berlin .
as bush 's first overseas trip of his second term , the european visit , which will also include bi-lateral meetings with french president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , is intended to set the tone for a new working relationship after europe and the us drifted apart over the iraq war . looking towards the middle east " as past debates fade , and great duties become clear , let us begin a new era of transatlantic unity , " bush was due to announce to his european counterparts , many of whom such as chirac and schröder have been critical of washington 's " go-it-alone " foreign policy in iraq and the middle east . diplomats in brussels have suggested the eu would press the us leader for substantive progress on the middle east " roadmap " following the election of a new palestinian leadership and its declaration of a truce with israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe calls for bush to work closer with sharon and abbas in bringing about peace for the middle east .

" america supports a strong europe because we need a strong partner in the hard work of advancing freedom in the world , " said the speech , in which bush made spreading democracy a central pillar of his second four-year term in the white house . " our strong friendship is essential to peace and prosperity across the globe – and no temporary debate , no passing disagreement of governments , no power on earth will ever divide us , " the president was due to say . question of iran one issue likely to feature high on the agenda of both eu leaders and bush is the escalation in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

us officials , on the other hand , are pushing for iran to be hauled before the un security council , claiming tehran is covering up the development of nuclear weapons .
the europeans prefer a carrot-and-stick approach coupling nuclear compliance with the promise of a lucrative new trade accord for iran . europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons .
bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . bush will most likely not dwell on these differences or on the fact that the us opposes a european plan to lift an embargo on arms sales to china .
instead he will concentrate on demonstrating cooperative spirit . " today , america and europe face a moment of consequence and opportunity , " he will say .

" from 2010 , we 'll have digital television all over europe , " he said .

but not every channel can be financed via advertising .
we will therefore set up channels for which the viewer must pay a fee . "
he further stated that potential markets include spain and france , and possibly germany as well .
" there is currently no strategic necessity to move into the german pay-tv market .
but that can change very quickly depending on the behavior of the cable suppliers and increased digitalization , " zeiler said , adding that rtl might " start one or another pay-tv project in germany in the coming years . "

" this is an important success , " talat told reporters . his party 's showing was a significant advance on the last polls in december 2003 in which it emerged the largest with 35.2 percent of the vote but was forced to form a coalition with the more nationalist democrat party of serdar denktash , son of veteran hardline leader rauf denktash . but the final results still gave his party just 24 of the 50 seats in parliament , two short of a majority , again forcing it to form a coalition . but a 5.8 percent showing for another smaller pro-un plan faction , the peace and democracy party , gave it one mp , offering talat the possibility of a more dovish coalition partner . olive branch to greek cypriots he immediately held out an olive branch to cyprus president tassos papadopoulos , whose majority greek cypriot community overwhelming rejected the un reunification blueprint at his urging in a referendum last april , saying the election result showed the turkish cypriots ' continuing desire for a solution . " i want to call on the greek cypriot side leadership to take our hand , which we are extending in peace to them and we will continue to put our best effort for reconciliation and a solution to the cyprus problem , " he said . talat called on the international community to make good on its promises to reward the turkish cypriot yes vote in last year 's referendum by easing the economic isolation of the breakaway state declared in 1983 but recognized only by ankara . " it is not up to me but up to the international community to help us end the isolation , " he said .
" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

but while the main rival , the conservative cdu managed to gain five percent it seems that may not be enough – and all eyes are now on the party of the state ’ s tiny minority of danes in germany who is emerging as the key player . the ssw party representing schleswig-holstein ‘ s danish minority , will become kingmakers after sundays elections – which developed into a cliffhanger as counting went on well into monday morning .
the danish ssw has won two seats , but if they make true their pledge of support for the red-green coalition this could give them a lead of one seat over the opposition . this would then allow the state 's premier , heide simonis , to remain in office of the northern which she has ruled for the past 12 years .
the spd won the decisive election precinct by just 70 votes . cdu still pleased the conservative cdu and their liberal allies are still pleased with their own showing . the cdu emerged the strongest party with about 40 percent of the vote .
this success is a major boost to party leader angela merkel and her bid for the candidacy in the race for chancellor in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " it ’ s a sensational result and it shows that a strong campaign and unity in the party are paying off , " merkel said .
" it ’ s also a clear signal that the red-green government both at regional and national level is reaching its end .
there is only one state left where the social democrats can rule on their own .
but we will win this state of north-rhine westaphalia in may as well . " disappointment for the spd while it seems that the social democrat led government has scraped through in schleswig-holstein , the outcome was still a disappointment to the spd .
only three months ago opinion polls had predicted a clear victory . nevertheless , party leader franz müntefering sad he saw a silver lining - claiming the party has begun to recover after suffering a string of even worse batterings in state polls last year . " i ’ m convinced this election is also a sign that the social democrats have passed the valley of tears , " he said .
" we have seen the low point last autumn and are now heading towards new victories . " greens survive scandal after strong gains in eastern german state elections last september , the far-right npd party failed to make the 5 percent threshold needed to enter parliament .
the greens ' party leader claudia roth said this is , however , no reason to let up in the fight against the neo-nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " i ’ m very relieved that the voters have shown the red card to the neo-nazis , " she said .
" but this is of course no reason to slow efforts to curb the resurgence of right-wing and anti-semitic sentiments . " with about 6 percent the greens were able to win as many votes as 5 years ago – and that in spite of the scandal over unchecked immigration currently engulfing their charismatic figurehead , german foreign minister joschka fischer . the liberals slumped slightly to 6.6 percent .
although the danish minority traditionally supports the social democrats , their leaders said on monday they would hold talks with all parties before deciding whether or not to tolerate a minority red-green government . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder party loses key state poll chancellor schröder 's social democrats have unexpectedly lost power in schleswig-holstein according to exit polls .

khaled el-masri , who is of lebanese descent but has a german passport , claims to have been abducted by us operatives while on holiday in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 .
three weeks later , masri said , he was put on an airplane to afghanistan , where he was shackled , punched and interrogated about extremists at his mosque in ulm , germany .
he further stated that he was released months later and dropped off on a deserted road leading into macedonia .
the case is being investigated by a munich prosecutor as a kidnapping case , the weekly said .
the cia allegedly whisked foreign terror suspects to clandestine interrogation facilities , using a boeing 737 plane specially dedicated for that purpose , newsweek reported sunday .
the allegation , if proven true , is " further evidence that a global ' ghost ' prison system , where terror suspects are secretly interrogated , is being operated by the cia , " the weekly wrote . dw-world.de german group : terror fight violates human rights a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights .

" from 2010 , we 'll have digital television all over europe , " he said .

but not every channel can be financed via advertising .
we will therefore set up channels for which the viewer must pay a fee . "
he further stated that potential markets include spain and france , and possibly germany as well .
" there is currently no strategic necessity to move into the german pay-tv market .
but that can change very quickly depending on the behavior of the cable suppliers and increased digitalization , " zeiler said , adding that rtl might " start one or another pay-tv project in germany in the coming years . "
rtl has so far focussed on free-to-air broadcasting . dw-world.de german television enters the digital age the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .

the case is being investigated by a munich prosecutor as a kidnapping case , the weekly said .
the cia allegedly whisked foreign terror suspects to clandestine interrogation facilities , using a boeing 737 plane specially dedicated for that purpose , newsweek reported sunday .

" now is the time for us to set aside differences and to move forward , " bush said before leaving washington for a five-day trip to europe where he plans to focus on emphasizing the " strong friendship " with europe . on monday , the us president was to meet with european union and nato leaders in brussels , where he will give a keynote speech stressing " a new era of transatlantic unity " and continued cooperation on issues like iran and the middle east peace process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush last visited germany on may 23 , 2002 when he met with chancellor schröder in berlin .
as bush 's first overseas trip of his second term , the european visit , which will also include bi-lateral meetings with french president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , is intended to set the tone for a new working relationship after europe and the us drifted apart over the iraq war . looking towards the middle east " as past debates fade , and great duties become clear , let us begin a new era of transatlantic unity , " bush was due to announce to his european counterparts , many of whom such as chirac and schröder have been critical of washington 's " go-it-alone " foreign policy in iraq and the middle east . diplomats in brussels have suggested the eu would press the us leader for substantive progress on the middle east " roadmap " following the election of a new palestinian leadership and its declaration of a truce with israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe calls for bush to work closer with sharon and abbas in bringing about peace for the middle east .

" america supports a strong europe because we need a strong partner in the hard work of advancing freedom in the world , " said the speech , in which bush made spreading democracy a central pillar of his second four-year term in the white house . " our strong friendship is essential to peace and prosperity across the globe – and no temporary debate , no passing disagreement of governments , no power on earth will ever divide us , " the president was due to say . question of iran one issue likely to feature high on the agenda of both eu leaders and bush is the escalation in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

us officials , on the other hand , are pushing for iran to be hauled before the un security council , claiming tehran is covering up the development of nuclear weapons .
the europeans prefer a carrot-and-stick approach coupling nuclear compliance with the promise of a lucrative new trade accord for iran . europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons .
bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . bush will most likely not dwell on these differences or on the fact that the us opposes a european plan to lift an embargo on arms sales to china .
instead he will concentrate on demonstrating cooperative spirit . " today , america and europe face a moment of consequence and opportunity , " he will say .

" now is the time for us to set aside differences and to move forward , " bush said before leaving washington for a five-day trip to europe where he plans to focus on emphasizing the " strong friendship " with europe . on monday , the us president was to meet with european union and nato leaders in brussels , where he will give a keynote speech stressing " a new era of transatlantic unity " and continued cooperation on issues like iran and the middle east peace process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush last visited germany on may 23 , 2002 when he met with chancellor schröder in berlin .
as bush 's first overseas trip of his second term , the european visit , which will also include bi-lateral meetings with french president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , is intended to set the tone for a new working relationship after europe and the us drifted apart over the iraq war . looking towards the middle east " as past debates fade , and great duties become clear , let us begin a new era of transatlantic unity , " bush was due to announce to his european counterparts , many of whom such as chirac and schröder have been critical of washington 's " go-it-alone " foreign policy in iraq and the middle east . diplomats in brussels have suggested the eu would press the us leader for substantive progress on the middle east " roadmap " following the election of a new palestinian leadership and its declaration of a truce with israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe calls for bush to work closer with sharon and abbas in bringing about peace for the middle east .

" america supports a strong europe because we need a strong partner in the hard work of advancing freedom in the world , " said the speech , in which bush made spreading democracy a central pillar of his second four-year term in the white house . " our strong friendship is essential to peace and prosperity across the globe – and no temporary debate , no passing disagreement of governments , no power on earth will ever divide us , " the president was due to say . question of iran one issue likely to feature high on the agenda of both eu leaders and bush is the escalation in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

us officials , on the other hand , are pushing for iran to be hauled before the un security council , claiming tehran is covering up the development of nuclear weapons .
the europeans prefer a carrot-and-stick approach coupling nuclear compliance with the promise of a lucrative new trade accord for iran . europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons .
bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . bush will most likely not dwell on these differences or on the fact that the us opposes a european plan to lift an embargo on arms sales to china .
instead he will concentrate on demonstrating cooperative spirit . " today , america and europe face a moment of consequence and opportunity , " he will say .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .
german carmaker audi produces its tt sports wagon there , the hungarian phone company matav , once state owned , has long been a part of deutsche telekom .
other well-known german multinationals , such as eon , bosch and commerzbank , have made names for themselves in hungary . foreign investment : essential at a conference on monday in bonn , heads of state of both countries , prime minister gyurcsany and german chancellor gerhard schröder , gathered with about 350 firms to talk about what the future economic landscape in hungary might look like and whether it can continue the rapid pace of growth and investment it has enjoyed over the last decade and a half . schröder called on german firms to continue investing abroad , including hungary .
he said the fact that germany was so dependent on exports - one of the few motors driving the economy forward - foreign investment was essential . " it secures access to markets that we otherwise would n't have , " he told conference participants .
" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .
its eastern neighbors , such as romania and ukraine , are increasingly attracting investors - that might have once considered hungary - due to their lower wages and tax rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of budapest celebrates hungary 's eu referendum with fireworks on saturday night , april 12 , 2003 , in front of the historical chain bridge and the royal caste of budapest .
hungary will decide whether to join the european union in this referendum .
even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .
finnish mobile phone giant nokia also wants to invest more in hungary in the future . that is reflected in its healthy growth rate .
in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people . " it seems that a large portion of the country did n't even notice that we joined , " he told german television .
or if they did , he added , it was because " whisky was suddenly cheaper . " gerwald herter -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.02.2005 when business gets the flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hit hard by the flu virus anti-virus programs , security updates , firewalls – companies invest millions to protect computers from damaging viruses while little is done to prevent influenza , an equally costly bug in terms of lost productivity . according to the german office for security information technology , computer viruses result in annual damages amounting to millions . it ’ s no wonder then that companies rush to get the best when it comes to preventive it medicine such as anti-virus programs , security patches and fortified firewalls . but when it comes to protecting their workers from contagious air-born viruses like influenza , relatively little is done , even though these bugs can be potentially just as costly in terms of lost productivity and revenue , not to mention life .
a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

" this is an important success , " talat told reporters . his party 's showing was a significant advance on the last polls in december 2003 in which it emerged the largest with 35.2 percent of the vote but was forced to form a coalition with the more nationalist democrat party of serdar denktash , son of veteran hardline leader rauf denktash . but the final results still gave his party just 24 of the 50 seats in parliament , two short of a majority , again forcing it to form a coalition . but a 5.8 percent showing for another smaller pro-un plan faction , the peace and democracy party , gave it one mp , offering talat the possibility of a more dovish coalition partner . olive branch to greek cypriots he immediately held out an olive branch to cyprus president tassos papadopoulos , whose majority greek cypriot community overwhelming rejected the un reunification blueprint at his urging in a referendum last april , saying the election result showed the turkish cypriots ' continuing desire for a solution . " i want to call on the greek cypriot side leadership to take our hand , which we are extending in peace to them and we will continue to put our best effort for reconciliation and a solution to the cyprus problem , " he said . talat called on the international community to make good on its promises to reward the turkish cypriot yes vote in last year 's referendum by easing the economic isolation of the breakaway state declared in 1983 but recognized only by ankara . " it is not up to me but up to the international community to help us end the isolation , " he said .
" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

but while the main rival , the conservative cdu managed to gain five percent it seems that may not be enough – and all eyes are now on the party of the state ’ s tiny minority of danes in germany who is emerging as the key player . the ssw party representing schleswig-holstein ‘ s danish minority , will become kingmakers after sundays elections – which developed into a cliffhanger as counting went on well into monday morning .
the danish ssw has won two seats , but if they make true their pledge of support for the red-green coalition this could give them a lead of one seat over the opposition . this would then allow the state 's premier , heide simonis , to remain in office of the northern which she has ruled for the past 12 years .
the spd won the decisive election precinct by just 70 votes . cdu still pleased the conservative cdu and their liberal allies are still pleased with their own showing . the cdu emerged the strongest party with about 40 percent of the vote .
this success is a major boost to party leader angela merkel and her bid for the candidacy in the race for chancellor in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " it ’ s a sensational result and it shows that a strong campaign and unity in the party are paying off , " merkel said .
" it ’ s also a clear signal that the red-green government both at regional and national level is reaching its end .
there is only one state left where the social democrats can rule on their own .
but we will win this state of north-rhine westaphalia in may as well . " disappointment for the spd while it seems that the social democrat led government has scraped through in schleswig-holstein , the outcome was still a disappointment to the spd .
only three months ago opinion polls had predicted a clear victory . nevertheless , party leader franz müntefering sad he saw a silver lining - claiming the party has begun to recover after suffering a string of even worse batterings in state polls last year . " i ’ m convinced this election is also a sign that the social democrats have passed the valley of tears , " he said .
" we have seen the low point last autumn and are now heading towards new victories . " greens survive scandal after strong gains in eastern german state elections last september , the far-right npd party failed to make the 5 percent threshold needed to enter parliament .
the greens ' party leader claudia roth said this is , however , no reason to let up in the fight against the neo-nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " i ’ m very relieved that the voters have shown the red card to the neo-nazis , " she said .
" but this is of course no reason to slow efforts to curb the resurgence of right-wing and anti-semitic sentiments . " with about 6 percent the greens were able to win as many votes as 5 years ago – and that in spite of the scandal over unchecked immigration currently engulfing their charismatic figurehead , german foreign minister joschka fischer . the liberals slumped slightly to 6.6 percent .
although the danish minority traditionally supports the social democrats , their leaders said on monday they would hold talks with all parties before deciding whether or not to tolerate a minority red-green government . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder party loses key state poll chancellor schröder 's social democrats have unexpectedly lost power in schleswig-holstein according to exit polls .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

12 , 2005 -rrb- germany well-prepared for flu season even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .
the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

he also urged cooperation on iran and the middle east and urged russia to renew its commitment to democracy . it is bush 's first overseas trip since the beginning of his second term in office and during his speech before an audience in the 19th century concert noble hall , he struck a note that was more conciliatory than the go-it-alone attitude prevalent during his first term that was widely criticized by european leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is escorted by prime minister guy verhofstadt of belgium to deliver a foreign policy speech at the concert noble ballroom in brussels .
" together we can once again set history on a hopeful course , " he said , urging the eu to help reconstruct iraq , adding that he wanted to work in partnership with a united europe . in a move aimed at easing transatlantic tensions during bush 's visit , on monday eu foreign ministers approved a plan to train 770 senior iraqi police officers and judges in the eu and in countries near iraq .
the mission is due to start in mid-2005 and could be extended to iraq if the security situation on the ground there improves . iran and middle east during his speech in brussels , the us leader also addressed the issue of iran , which has made many europeans uneasy since there are fears that the us might also be considering using force to make iran give up its nuclear ambitions . he left open the possibility of military action there , although he emphasized a diplomatic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in safeguarding the security of free nations , no option can be taken permanently off the table .
iran , however , is different from iraq .
we 're in the early stages of diplomacy , " he said . the dispute over iran 's nuclear program has seen the eu and the us take different approaches .
britain , france and germany have been negotiating with the islamic republic to try to bring its nuclear activities into the framework of un guidelines .
the three have preferred a carrot-and-stick approach , promising trade accords in return for tehran 's renouncement of nuclear power . on the other hand , us officials , who claim tehran wants to use its nuclear program to develop atomic weapons , are pushing for iran to be taken before the un security council .
europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons . bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . message to putin russia was also a topic in the speech , reflecting concern by western nations that the country led by vladimir putin is drifting toward authoritarianism .
bush will meet with putin on thursday in bratislava , the capital of slovakia . bush said the us supports membership for russia in the world trade organization , but that " for russia to make progress as a european nation , the russian government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . " he added that the us and eu should put reform at the heart of their dialogue with russia , saying that reform will not happen overnight . reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush meets with french president jacques chirac in brussels on monday much of bush 's time during his european trip will be spent with leaders who opposed his iraq policy , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and putin . bush tried to play down their rifts , calling them a " temporary debate " and a " passing disagreement of governments . " eu trade commission peter mandelson , in reacting to bush 's speech , called it an " evolution of american policy , " saying the us had learned it was better to work with and through allies . still , there were no apologies for either side on the us-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" the time has come to draw a line under the tensions of the recent past , " said verhofstadt while introducing bush .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .
german carmaker audi produces its tt sports wagon there , the hungarian phone company matav , once state owned , has long been a part of deutsche telekom .
other well-known german multinationals , such as eon , bosch and commerzbank , have made names for themselves in hungary . foreign investment : essential at a conference on monday in bonn , heads of state of both countries , prime minister gyurcsany and german chancellor gerhard schröder , gathered with about 350 firms to talk about what the future economic landscape in hungary might look like and whether it can continue the rapid pace of growth and investment it has enjoyed over the last decade and a half . schröder called on german firms to continue investing abroad , including hungary .
he said the fact that germany was so dependent on exports - one of the few motors driving the economy forward - foreign investment was essential . " it secures access to markets that we otherwise would n't have , " he told conference participants .
" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .
its eastern neighbors , such as romania and ukraine , are increasingly attracting investors - that might have once considered hungary - due to their lower wages and tax rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of budapest celebrates hungary 's eu referendum with fireworks on saturday night , april 12 , 2003 , in front of the historical chain bridge and the royal caste of budapest .
hungary will decide whether to join the european union in this referendum .
even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .
finnish mobile phone giant nokia also wants to invest more in hungary in the future . that is reflected in its healthy growth rate .
in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people . " it seems that a large portion of the country did n't even notice that we joined , " he told german television .

" this is an important success , " talat told reporters . his party 's showing was a significant advance on the last polls in december 2003 in which it emerged the largest with 35.2 percent of the vote but was forced to form a coalition with the more nationalist democrat party of serdar denktash , son of veteran hardline leader rauf denktash . but the final results still gave his party just 24 of the 50 seats in parliament , two short of a majority , again forcing it to form a coalition . but a 5.8 percent showing for another smaller pro-un plan faction , the peace and democracy party , gave it one mp , offering talat the possibility of a more dovish coalition partner . olive branch to greek cypriots he immediately held out an olive branch to cyprus president tassos papadopoulos , whose majority greek cypriot community overwhelming rejected the un reunification blueprint at his urging in a referendum last april , saying the election result showed the turkish cypriots ' continuing desire for a solution . " i want to call on the greek cypriot side leadership to take our hand , which we are extending in peace to them and we will continue to put our best effort for reconciliation and a solution to the cyprus problem , " he said . talat called on the international community to make good on its promises to reward the turkish cypriot yes vote in last year 's referendum by easing the economic isolation of the breakaway state declared in 1983 but recognized only by ankara . " it is not up to me but up to the international community to help us end the isolation , " he said .
" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .

" this is an important success , " talat told reporters . his party 's showing was a significant advance on the last polls in december 2003 in which it emerged the largest with 35.2 percent of the vote but was forced to form a coalition with the more nationalist democrat party of serdar denktash , son of veteran hardline leader rauf denktash . but the final results still gave his party just 24 of the 50 seats in parliament , two short of a majority , again forcing it to form a coalition . but a 5.8 percent showing for another smaller pro-un plan faction , the peace and democracy party , gave it one mp , offering talat the possibility of a more dovish coalition partner . olive branch to greek cypriots he immediately held out an olive branch to cyprus president tassos papadopoulos , whose majority greek cypriot community overwhelming rejected the un reunification blueprint at his urging in a referendum last april , saying the election result showed the turkish cypriots ' continuing desire for a solution . " i want to call on the greek cypriot side leadership to take our hand , which we are extending in peace to them and we will continue to put our best effort for reconciliation and a solution to the cyprus problem , " he said . talat called on the international community to make good on its promises to reward the turkish cypriot yes vote in last year 's referendum by easing the economic isolation of the breakaway state declared in 1983 but recognized only by ankara . " it is not up to me but up to the international community to help us end the isolation , " he said .
" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.02.2005 when business gets the flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hit hard by the flu virus anti-virus programs , security updates , firewalls – companies invest millions to protect computers from damaging viruses while little is done to prevent influenza , an equally costly bug in terms of lost productivity . according to the german office for security information technology , computer viruses result in annual damages amounting to millions . it ’ s no wonder then that companies rush to get the best when it comes to preventive it medicine such as anti-virus programs , security patches and fortified firewalls . but when it comes to protecting their workers from contagious air-born viruses like influenza , relatively little is done , even though these bugs can be potentially just as costly in terms of lost productivity and revenue , not to mention life .
a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

" now is the time for us to set aside differences and to move forward , " bush said before leaving washington for a five-day trip to europe where he plans to focus on emphasizing the " strong friendship " with europe . on monday , the us president was to meet with european union and nato leaders in brussels , where he will give a keynote speech stressing " a new era of transatlantic unity " and continued cooperation on issues like iran and the middle east peace process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush last visited germany on may 23 , 2002 when he met with chancellor schröder in berlin .
as bush 's first overseas trip of his second term , the european visit , which will also include bi-lateral meetings with french president jacques chirac , british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , is intended to set the tone for a new working relationship after europe and the us drifted apart over the iraq war . looking towards the middle east " as past debates fade , and great duties become clear , let us begin a new era of transatlantic unity , " bush was due to announce to his european counterparts , many of whom such as chirac and schröder have been critical of washington 's " go-it-alone " foreign policy in iraq and the middle east . diplomats in brussels have suggested the eu would press the us leader for substantive progress on the middle east " roadmap " following the election of a new palestinian leadership and its declaration of a truce with israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe calls for bush to work closer with sharon and abbas in bringing about peace for the middle east .
-lrb- archive photo from june 4 , 2003 -rrb- according to an advance copy of his speech , bush was to say that ending the israeli-palestinian conflict was " our immediate goal , " and give strong words of praise and support for the efforts of the european union . " america supports a strong europe because we need a strong partner in the hard work of advancing freedom in the world , " said the speech , in which bush made spreading democracy a central pillar of his second four-year term in the white house . " our strong friendship is essential to peace and prosperity across the globe – and no temporary debate , no passing disagreement of governments , no power on earth will ever divide us , " the president was due to say . question of iran one issue likely to feature high on the agenda of both eu leaders and bush is the escalation in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .
eu heavyweights britain , france and germany have been negotiating with the islamic republic to try to bring its nuclear activities into the framework of un guidelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian and eu officials met dec .
13 , 2004 to discuss trade cooperation and tehran 's nuclear program .
us officials , on the other hand , are pushing for iran to be hauled before the un security council , claiming tehran is covering up the development of nuclear weapons .

" together we can once again set history on a hopeful course , " he said , urging the eu to help reconstruct iraq , adding that he wanted to work in partnership with a united europe . in a move aimed at easing transatlantic tensions during bush 's visit , on monday eu foreign ministers approved a plan to train 770 senior iraqi police officers and judges in the eu and in countries near iraq .
the mission is due to start in mid-2005 and could be extended to iraq if the security situation on the ground there improves . iran and middle east during his speech in brussels , the us leader also addressed the issue of iran , which has made many europeans uneasy since there are fears that the us might also be considering using force to make iran give up its nuclear ambitions . he left open the possibility of military action there , although he emphasized a diplomatic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in safeguarding the security of free nations , no option can be taken permanently off the table .
iran , however , is different from iraq .
we 're in the early stages of diplomacy , " he said . the dispute over iran 's nuclear program has seen the eu and the us take different approaches .
britain , france and germany have been negotiating with the islamic republic to try to bring its nuclear activities into the framework of un guidelines .
the three have preferred a carrot-and-stick approach , promising trade accords in return for tehran 's renouncement of nuclear power . on the other hand , us officials , who claim tehran wants to use its nuclear program to develop atomic weapons , are pushing for iran to be taken before the un security council .
europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons . bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . message to putin russia was also a topic in the speech , reflecting concern by western nations that the country led by vladimir putin is drifting toward authoritarianism .
bush will meet with putin on thursday in bratislava , the capital of slovakia . bush said the us supports membership for russia in the world trade organization , but that " for russia to make progress as a european nation , the russian government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . " he added that the us and eu should put reform at the heart of their dialogue with russia , saying that reform will not happen overnight . reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush meets with french president jacques chirac in brussels on monday much of bush 's time during his european trip will be spent with leaders who opposed his iraq policy , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and putin . bush tried to play down their rifts , calling them a " temporary debate " and a " passing disagreement of governments . " eu trade commission peter mandelson , in reacting to bush 's speech , called it an " evolution of american policy , " saying the us had learned it was better to work with and through allies . still , there were no apologies for either side on the us-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" the time has come to draw a line under the tensions of the recent past , " said verhofstadt while introducing bush .
" it makes little sense to continue arguing about who was right and who was wrong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.02.2005 when business gets the flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hit hard by the flu virus anti-virus programs , security updates , firewalls – companies invest millions to protect computers from damaging viruses while little is done to prevent influenza , an equally costly bug in terms of lost productivity . according to the german office for security information technology , computer viruses result in annual damages amounting to millions . it ’ s no wonder then that companies rush to get the best when it comes to preventive it medicine such as anti-virus programs , security patches and fortified firewalls . but when it comes to protecting their workers from contagious air-born viruses like influenza , relatively little is done , even though these bugs can be potentially just as costly in terms of lost productivity and revenue , not to mention life .
a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .
-lrb- feb .
12 , 2005 -rrb- germany well-prepared for flu season even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .
the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them .

but now an archeologist has determined that it 's actually part of germany 's oldest throne , sat in by emperor charlemagne . usually the western city of aachen gets all the press - at least when it comes to charlemagne .
it was the favorite residence of the emperor and served as the principal coronation site of holy roman emperors and german kings from the middle ages to the reformation . but now aachen 's been upstaged somewhat since an archeologist at the roman-germanic museum in mainz has uncovered part of an armrest that supported charlemagne 's royal left arm when he was visiting the city of mainz . the piece was actually discovered in 1911 when it was dug up while a clothing store was being constructed .
it was handed over to museum officials , who apparently were not that impressed .
it was catalogued , briefly described and promptly put away to gather dust in a museum storeroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlemagne , in stone decades later , the piece was pulled out of cold storage because a museum archeologist , mechthild schulze-dörrlamm , was researching stone monuments from the carolingian period .
after seeing the engravings on the piece , she realized she had more than a medieval signpost on her hands . further research and comparisons with other royal artifacts showed that the object supported the royal arm in the year 790 at the latest , making it older than the marble throne in aachen which dates from around 800 .

" this is an important success , " talat told reporters . his party 's showing was a significant advance on the last polls in december 2003 in which it emerged the largest with 35.2 percent of the vote but was forced to form a coalition with the more nationalist democrat party of serdar denktash , son of veteran hardline leader rauf denktash . but the final results still gave his party just 24 of the 50 seats in parliament , two short of a majority , again forcing it to form a coalition . but a 5.8 percent showing for another smaller pro-un plan faction , the peace and democracy party , gave it one mp , offering talat the possibility of a more dovish coalition partner . olive branch to greek cypriots he immediately held out an olive branch to cyprus president tassos papadopoulos , whose majority greek cypriot community overwhelming rejected the un reunification blueprint at his urging in a referendum last april , saying the election result showed the turkish cypriots ' continuing desire for a solution . " i want to call on the greek cypriot side leadership to take our hand , which we are extending in peace to them and we will continue to put our best effort for reconciliation and a solution to the cyprus problem , " he said . talat called on the international community to make good on its promises to reward the turkish cypriot yes vote in last year 's referendum by easing the economic isolation of the breakaway state declared in 1983 but recognized only by ankara . " it is not up to me but up to the international community to help us end the isolation , " he said .
" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .
german carmaker audi produces its tt sports wagon there , the hungarian phone company matav , once state owned , has long been a part of deutsche telekom .
other well-known german multinationals , such as eon , bosch and commerzbank , have made names for themselves in hungary . foreign investment : essential at a conference on monday in bonn , heads of state of both countries , prime minister gyurcsany and german chancellor gerhard schröder , gathered with about 350 firms to talk about what the future economic landscape in hungary might look like and whether it can continue the rapid pace of growth and investment it has enjoyed over the last decade and a half . schröder called on german firms to continue investing abroad , including hungary .
he said the fact that germany was so dependent on exports - one of the few motors driving the economy forward - foreign investment was essential . " it secures access to markets that we otherwise would n't have , " he told conference participants .
" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .

even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .
finnish mobile phone giant nokia also wants to invest more in hungary in the future . that is reflected in its healthy growth rate .
in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

but now an archeologist has determined that it 's actually part of germany 's oldest throne , sat in by emperor charlemagne . usually the western city of aachen gets all the press - at least when it comes to charlemagne .
it was the favorite residence of the emperor and served as the principal coronation site of holy roman emperors and german kings from the middle ages to the reformation . but now aachen 's been upstaged somewhat since an archeologist at the roman-germanic museum in mainz has uncovered part of an armrest that supported charlemagne 's royal left arm when he was visiting the city of mainz . the piece was actually discovered in 1911 when it was dug up while a clothing store was being constructed .
it was handed over to museum officials , who apparently were not that impressed .
it was catalogued , briefly described and promptly put away to gather dust in a museum storeroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlemagne , in stone decades later , the piece was pulled out of cold storage because a museum archeologist , mechthild schulze-dörrlamm , was researching stone monuments from the carolingian period .
after seeing the engravings on the piece , she realized she had more than a medieval signpost on her hands . further research and comparisons with other royal artifacts showed that the object supported the royal arm in the year 790 at the latest , making it older than the marble throne in aachen which dates from around 800 .
that royal chair previously held the record for the oldest extant throne , but has now been knocked off its perch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of the weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .

given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .

but now an archeologist has determined that it 's actually part of germany 's oldest throne , sat in by emperor charlemagne . usually the western city of aachen gets all the press - at least when it comes to charlemagne .
it was the favorite residence of the emperor and served as the principal coronation site of holy roman emperors and german kings from the middle ages to the reformation . but now aachen 's been upstaged somewhat since an archeologist at the roman-germanic museum in mainz has uncovered part of an armrest that supported charlemagne 's royal left arm when he was visiting the city of mainz . the piece was actually discovered in 1911 when it was dug up while a clothing store was being constructed .
it was handed over to museum officials , who apparently were not that impressed .
it was catalogued , briefly described and promptly put away to gather dust in a museum storeroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlemagne , in stone decades later , the piece was pulled out of cold storage because a museum archeologist , mechthild schulze-dörrlamm , was researching stone monuments from the carolingian period .
after seeing the engravings on the piece , she realized she had more than a medieval signpost on her hands . further research and comparisons with other royal artifacts showed that the object supported the royal arm in the year 790 at the latest , making it older than the marble throne in aachen which dates from around 800 .
that royal chair previously held the record for the oldest extant throne , but has now been knocked off its perch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of the weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

but now an archeologist has determined that it 's actually part of germany 's oldest throne , sat in by emperor charlemagne . usually the western city of aachen gets all the press - at least when it comes to charlemagne .
it was the favorite residence of the emperor and served as the principal coronation site of holy roman emperors and german kings from the middle ages to the reformation . but now aachen 's been upstaged somewhat since an archeologist at the roman-germanic museum in mainz has uncovered part of an armrest that supported charlemagne 's royal left arm when he was visiting the city of mainz . the piece was actually discovered in 1911 when it was dug up while a clothing store was being constructed .
it was handed over to museum officials , who apparently were not that impressed .
it was catalogued , briefly described and promptly put away to gather dust in a museum storeroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlemagne , in stone decades later , the piece was pulled out of cold storage because a museum archeologist , mechthild schulze-dörrlamm , was researching stone monuments from the carolingian period .
after seeing the engravings on the piece , she realized she had more than a medieval signpost on her hands . further research and comparisons with other royal artifacts showed that the object supported the royal arm in the year 790 at the latest , making it older than the marble throne in aachen which dates from around 800 .
that royal chair previously held the record for the oldest extant throne , but has now been knocked off its perch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of the weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .
german carmaker audi produces its tt sports wagon there , the hungarian phone company matav , once state owned , has long been a part of deutsche telekom .
other well-known german multinationals , such as eon , bosch and commerzbank , have made names for themselves in hungary . foreign investment : essential at a conference on monday in bonn , heads of state of both countries , prime minister gyurcsany and german chancellor gerhard schröder , gathered with about 350 firms to talk about what the future economic landscape in hungary might look like and whether it can continue the rapid pace of growth and investment it has enjoyed over the last decade and a half . schröder called on german firms to continue investing abroad , including hungary .
he said the fact that germany was so dependent on exports - one of the few motors driving the economy forward - foreign investment was essential . " it secures access to markets that we otherwise would n't have , " he told conference participants .
" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .
its eastern neighbors , such as romania and ukraine , are increasingly attracting investors - that might have once considered hungary - due to their lower wages and tax rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of budapest celebrates hungary 's eu referendum with fireworks on saturday night , april 12 , 2003 , in front of the historical chain bridge and the royal caste of budapest .
hungary will decide whether to join the european union in this referendum .
even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .
finnish mobile phone giant nokia also wants to invest more in hungary in the future . that is reflected in its healthy growth rate .
in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people . " it seems that a large portion of the country did n't even notice that we joined , " he told german television .
or if they did , he added , it was because " whisky was suddenly cheaper . " gerwald herter -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

but now an archeologist has determined that it 's actually part of germany 's oldest throne , sat in by emperor charlemagne . usually the western city of aachen gets all the press - at least when it comes to charlemagne .
it was the favorite residence of the emperor and served as the principal coronation site of holy roman emperors and german kings from the middle ages to the reformation . but now aachen 's been upstaged somewhat since an archeologist at the roman-germanic museum in mainz has uncovered part of an armrest that supported charlemagne 's royal left arm when he was visiting the city of mainz . the piece was actually discovered in 1911 when it was dug up while a clothing store was being constructed .
it was handed over to museum officials , who apparently were not that impressed .
it was catalogued , briefly described and promptly put away to gather dust in a museum storeroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlemagne , in stone decades later , the piece was pulled out of cold storage because a museum archeologist , mechthild schulze-dörrlamm , was researching stone monuments from the carolingian period .
after seeing the engravings on the piece , she realized she had more than a medieval signpost on her hands . further research and comparisons with other royal artifacts showed that the object supported the royal arm in the year 790 at the latest , making it older than the marble throne in aachen which dates from around 800 .
that royal chair previously held the record for the oldest extant throne , but has now been knocked off its perch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of the weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.02.2005 when business gets the flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been hit hard by the flu virus anti-virus programs , security updates , firewalls – companies invest millions to protect computers from damaging viruses while little is done to prevent influenza , an equally costly bug in terms of lost productivity . according to the german office for security information technology , computer viruses result in annual damages amounting to millions . it ’ s no wonder then that companies rush to get the best when it comes to preventive it medicine such as anti-virus programs , security patches and fortified firewalls . but when it comes to protecting their workers from contagious air-born viruses like influenza , relatively little is done , even though these bugs can be potentially just as costly in terms of lost productivity and revenue , not to mention life .
a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .
german carmaker audi produces its tt sports wagon there , the hungarian phone company matav , once state owned , has long been a part of deutsche telekom .
other well-known german multinationals , such as eon , bosch and commerzbank , have made names for themselves in hungary . foreign investment : essential at a conference on monday in bonn , heads of state of both countries , prime minister gyurcsany and german chancellor gerhard schröder , gathered with about 350 firms to talk about what the future economic landscape in hungary might look like and whether it can continue the rapid pace of growth and investment it has enjoyed over the last decade and a half . schröder called on german firms to continue investing abroad , including hungary .
he said the fact that germany was so dependent on exports - one of the few motors driving the economy forward - foreign investment was essential . " it secures access to markets that we otherwise would n't have , " he told conference participants .
" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .
its eastern neighbors , such as romania and ukraine , are increasingly attracting investors - that might have once considered hungary - due to their lower wages and tax rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of budapest celebrates hungary 's eu referendum with fireworks on saturday night , april 12 , 2003 , in front of the historical chain bridge and the royal caste of budapest .
hungary will decide whether to join the european union in this referendum .
even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .
finnish mobile phone giant nokia also wants to invest more in hungary in the future . that is reflected in its healthy growth rate .
in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people . " it seems that a large portion of the country did n't even notice that we joined , " he told german television .
or if they did , he added , it was because " whisky was suddenly cheaper . " gerwald herter -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

but now an archeologist has determined that it 's actually part of germany 's oldest throne , sat in by emperor charlemagne . usually the western city of aachen gets all the press - at least when it comes to charlemagne .
it was the favorite residence of the emperor and served as the principal coronation site of holy roman emperors and german kings from the middle ages to the reformation . but now aachen 's been upstaged somewhat since an archeologist at the roman-germanic museum in mainz has uncovered part of an armrest that supported charlemagne 's royal left arm when he was visiting the city of mainz . the piece was actually discovered in 1911 when it was dug up while a clothing store was being constructed .
it was handed over to museum officials , who apparently were not that impressed .
it was catalogued , briefly described and promptly put away to gather dust in a museum storeroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlemagne , in stone decades later , the piece was pulled out of cold storage because a museum archeologist , mechthild schulze-dörrlamm , was researching stone monuments from the carolingian period .
after seeing the engravings on the piece , she realized she had more than a medieval signpost on her hands . further research and comparisons with other royal artifacts showed that the object supported the royal arm in the year 790 at the latest , making it older than the marble throne in aachen which dates from around 800 .
that royal chair previously held the record for the oldest extant throne , but has now been knocked off its perch . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of the weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

but that is putting it mildly .
in reality , the visit , which will last for just six hours , has triggered the largest-scale security operation the rhineland-palatinate police authorities have ever known .
come next wednesday , the weeks of us-german co-ordinated planning will be put into effect as highways and schools are closed , public transport is diverted and river and air traffic is suspended .
in short , the city will grind to a temporary standstill as the security circus , which involves thousands of police from all over the country , hogs the limelight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not even the public drains are left open to chance reinhard rothgerber , spokesman for the trier police department has been drafted in to help stem the flood of press enquiries in mainz .
" it is not just a matter of having police officers there on the day , there is so much to be done beforehand , from dealing with the media to increasing the number of officers on the beat checking for potential problems ahead of the visit , " rothgerber said .
justifiable fuss ?
bush is not the first high-profile american to cross the city limits . indeed , he is following in the footsteps of both bill clinton and his own father , bush senior .
so what , many citizens are asking , is all the fuss about ?
" george bush is considered to be at serious risk of attack , and it is our job to make sure that nothing happens to him , " rothgerber said .
but the cost of such determination on the part of the german authorities is causing considerable consternation among the locals , almost all of whom will be affected in one way or another .
parts of the inner city will only be open to those who live there , although even they will have to show their id cards to be allowed any kind of freedom of movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worshippers will have to wait til nightfall to say their prayers it will be a pain in the purse for many shop and restaurant owners in cordoned off areas . although they can officially set about business as usual if their paperwork in order , the streets will be largely devoid of one crucial component : customers .
enforced holiday many people have decided to take the day off , although they do n't feel they should have to .
that is also the stance taken by the service industry union , verdi , which officially advised its members not to cash in any time in lieu for a day off in the name of the us presidential visit , but to simply warn their superiors of the delays and difficulties they are likely to encounter in getting to work .
the police have set up a hotline for residents who want to know how they can move about next wednesday .

but that is putting it mildly .
in reality , the visit , which will last for just six hours , has triggered the largest-scale security operation the rhineland-palatinate police authorities have ever known .
come next wednesday , the weeks of us-german co-ordinated planning will be put into effect as highways and schools are closed , public transport is diverted and river and air traffic is suspended .

" it is not just a matter of having police officers there on the day , there is so much to be done beforehand , from dealing with the media to increasing the number of officers on the beat checking for potential problems ahead of the visit , " rothgerber said .
justifiable fuss ?
bush is not the first high-profile american to cross the city limits . indeed , he is following in the footsteps of both bill clinton and his own father , bush senior .
so what , many citizens are asking , is all the fuss about ?
" george bush is considered to be at serious risk of attack , and it is our job to make sure that nothing happens to him , " rothgerber said .
but the cost of such determination on the part of the german authorities is causing considerable consternation among the locals , almost all of whom will be affected in one way or another .
parts of the inner city will only be open to those who live there , although even they will have to show their id cards to be allowed any kind of freedom of movement .

that is also the stance taken by the service industry union , verdi , which officially advised its members not to cash in any time in lieu for a day off in the name of the us presidential visit , but to simply warn their superiors of the delays and difficulties they are likely to encounter in getting to work .
the police have set up a hotline for residents who want to know how they can move about next wednesday .
it opened on monday , and has been receiving between 3,000 and 3,500 calls daily .

" it looks like i will have to take the day off because with the highways closed , there is no way to get there .
it 's ridiculous , " she said .
" not welcome , mr bush " this restriction of movement begs a valid question .
" if the president has such massive security needs , then why choose a city like mainz as his destination ?
why not have him go to a more remote place , where fewer people would be affected ? "
mainz citizen , peter zenke asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters will get as close to the centre as they can why not indeed ?
the protest initiative " not welcome , mr bush " , which is planning a massive demonstration on wednesday , says the official reason for selecting mainz was that the us premier wanted a " cosy atmosphere " for his talks with chancellor schröder .
but with between five and ten thousand protesters expected to gather in the rhineland city on wednesday , the organisers hope to shatter any such illusion .
" although this will be a peaceful demonstration , we want bush to know that we do n't approve of his policies and that we do n't approve of visits like this one , " andreas atzl , spokesman for " not welcome , mr bush " , said .
atzl has been in close contact with both the police and the city in the run up to next week 's protest action .
at one stage his initiative was offered the use of public buildings as overnight accommodation for protesters from far-flung places .
but with just days to go , the offer was withdrawn without reason .
" it 's crazy because it would not only have helped us out by enabling demonstrators to arrive a day earlier , but would have eased the burden of traffic trying to get into the city on the actual day of the visit .
i guess the mayor just does n't want the protests , " atzl stated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiers are expected to meet at electors palace indeed the city is making quite something of the visit as a way of upping mainz 's profile on the world map .
" the upcoming visit is both an important event , and an opportunity for us to become an attractive economic and tourist location , " said mainz 's deputy mayor , norbert schüler .
" it is advertising for our city and it can not be too highly valued . "
that , atzl believes , is as maybe , " but it 's an absurd price to pay for a bit of publicity , and even worse for a visit in which the two premiers are not even likely to address the issues which matter .

he also urged cooperation on iran and the middle east and urged russia to renew its commitment to democracy . it is bush 's first overseas trip since the beginning of his second term in office and during his speech before an audience in the 19th century concert noble hall , he struck a note that was more conciliatory than the go-it-alone attitude prevalent during his first term that was widely criticized by european leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is escorted by prime minister guy verhofstadt of belgium to deliver a foreign policy speech at the concert noble ballroom in brussels .
" together we can once again set history on a hopeful course , " he said , urging the eu to help reconstruct iraq , adding that he wanted to work in partnership with a united europe . in a move aimed at easing transatlantic tensions during bush 's visit , on monday eu foreign ministers approved a plan to train 770 senior iraqi police officers and judges in the eu and in countries near iraq .
the mission is due to start in mid-2005 and could be extended to iraq if the security situation on the ground there improves . iran and middle east during his speech in brussels , the us leader also addressed the issue of iran , which has made many europeans uneasy since there are fears that the us might also be considering using force to make iran give up its nuclear ambitions . he left open the possibility of military action there , although he emphasized a diplomatic course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in safeguarding the security of free nations , no option can be taken permanently off the table .
iran , however , is different from iraq .
we 're in the early stages of diplomacy , " he said . the dispute over iran 's nuclear program has seen the eu and the us take different approaches .
britain , france and germany have been negotiating with the islamic republic to try to bring its nuclear activities into the framework of un guidelines .
the three have preferred a carrot-and-stick approach , promising trade accords in return for tehran 's renouncement of nuclear power . on the other hand , us officials , who claim tehran wants to use its nuclear program to develop atomic weapons , are pushing for iran to be taken before the un security council .
europeans only recently were alarmed by talk in washington of plans for a military strike on iran 's nuclear weapons . bush , however , sought to allay the fears saying they were " just not the truth . "
at the same time , he has made no effort to suppress his impatience with tehran 's slow response to diplomatic overtures . message to putin russia was also a topic in the speech , reflecting concern by western nations that the country led by vladimir putin is drifting toward authoritarianism .
bush will meet with putin on thursday in bratislava , the capital of slovakia . bush said the us supports membership for russia in the world trade organization , but that " for russia to make progress as a european nation , the russian government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . " he added that the us and eu should put reform at the heart of their dialogue with russia , saying that reform will not happen overnight . reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush meets with french president jacques chirac in brussels on monday much of bush 's time during his european trip will be spent with leaders who opposed his iraq policy , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and putin . bush tried to play down their rifts , calling them a " temporary debate " and a " passing disagreement of governments . " eu trade commission peter mandelson , in reacting to bush 's speech , called it an " evolution of american policy , " saying the us had learned it was better to work with and through allies . still , there were no apologies for either side on the us-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" the time has come to draw a line under the tensions of the recent past , " said verhofstadt while introducing bush .

but while the main rival , the conservative cdu managed to gain five percent it seems that may not be enough – and all eyes are now on the party of the state ’ s tiny minority of danes in germany who is emerging as the key player . the ssw party representing schleswig-holstein ‘ s danish minority , will become kingmakers after sundays elections – which developed into a cliffhanger as counting went on well into monday morning .
the danish ssw has won two seats , but if they make true their pledge of support for the red-green coalition this could give them a lead of one seat over the opposition . this would then allow the state 's premier , heide simonis , to remain in office of the northern which she has ruled for the past 12 years .
the spd won the decisive election precinct by just 70 votes . cdu still pleased the conservative cdu and their liberal allies are still pleased with their own showing . the cdu emerged the strongest party with about 40 percent of the vote .
this success is a major boost to party leader angela merkel and her bid for the candidacy in the race for chancellor in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " it ’ s a sensational result and it shows that a strong campaign and unity in the party are paying off , " merkel said .
" it ’ s also a clear signal that the red-green government both at regional and national level is reaching its end .
there is only one state left where the social democrats can rule on their own .
but we will win this state of north-rhine westaphalia in may as well . " disappointment for the spd while it seems that the social democrat led government has scraped through in schleswig-holstein , the outcome was still a disappointment to the spd .
only three months ago opinion polls had predicted a clear victory . nevertheless , party leader franz müntefering sad he saw a silver lining - claiming the party has begun to recover after suffering a string of even worse batterings in state polls last year . " i ’ m convinced this election is also a sign that the social democrats have passed the valley of tears , " he said .
" we have seen the low point last autumn and are now heading towards new victories . " greens survive scandal after strong gains in eastern german state elections last september , the far-right npd party failed to make the 5 percent threshold needed to enter parliament .
the greens ' party leader claudia roth said this is , however , no reason to let up in the fight against the neo-nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " i ’ m very relieved that the voters have shown the red card to the neo-nazis , " she said .
" but this is of course no reason to slow efforts to curb the resurgence of right-wing and anti-semitic sentiments . " with about 6 percent the greens were able to win as many votes as 5 years ago – and that in spite of the scandal over unchecked immigration currently engulfing their charismatic figurehead , german foreign minister joschka fischer . the liberals slumped slightly to 6.6 percent .
although the danish minority traditionally supports the social democrats , their leaders said on monday they would hold talks with all parties before deciding whether or not to tolerate a minority red-green government . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder party loses key state poll chancellor schröder 's social democrats have unexpectedly lost power in schleswig-holstein according to exit polls .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .

" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .

even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .

in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people . " it seems that a large portion of the country did n't even notice that we joined , " he told german television .

but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher . without the participation of german companies , hungary 's economic development since the end of communism would look much different .
over the past 15 years , german industry has invested around € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.68 million -rrb- in hungary , making up about a third of total foreign investment .
it 's a close economic relationship that has both its good side and its bad . " when the german economy gets the flu , hungary gets a cold , " said prime minister ferenc gyurcsany . still , despite germany 's less than stellar economic performance over the past few years , hungary has benefited greatly from its relationship with europe 's largest economy .
german carmaker audi produces its tt sports wagon there , the hungarian phone company matav , once state owned , has long been a part of deutsche telekom .
other well-known german multinationals , such as eon , bosch and commerzbank , have made names for themselves in hungary . foreign investment : essential at a conference on monday in bonn , heads of state of both countries , prime minister gyurcsany and german chancellor gerhard schröder , gathered with about 350 firms to talk about what the future economic landscape in hungary might look like and whether it can continue the rapid pace of growth and investment it has enjoyed over the last decade and a half . schröder called on german firms to continue investing abroad , including hungary .
he said the fact that germany was so dependent on exports - one of the few motors driving the economy forward - foreign investment was essential . " it secures access to markets that we otherwise would n't have , " he told conference participants .
" it also helps us secure jobs here at home . " tough competition despite hungary 's economic accomplishments , the country can ill afford to sit on its laurels , since some of the shine it had acquired in the 1990s is beginning to wear off .
its eastern neighbors , such as romania and ukraine , are increasingly attracting investors - that might have once considered hungary - due to their lower wages and tax rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of budapest celebrates hungary 's eu referendum with fireworks on saturday night , april 12 , 2003 , in front of the historical chain bridge and the royal caste of budapest .
hungary will decide whether to join the european union in this referendum .
even if hungary wanted to compete in these areas , it finds itself hemmed in by european union rules .
it has already been warned by the bloc , which it enthusiastically joined this year , that its debt is higher than brussels would like to see .
one-time plans to join the euro zone early and replace the forint with the european common currency have had to be shelved . even though hungary is still sticking to its plans to join the euro zone in 2010 , and thereby become a more attractive place for investors , not all analysts are certain that the country can meet that goal . good health while hungary might not be able to compete with low-wage , low-tax countries further east , it is still attracting foreign companies who are choosing the central european country as a research and development site , including deutsche telekom .
finnish mobile phone giant nokia also wants to invest more in hungary in the future . that is reflected in its healthy growth rate .
in 2004 , the country 's economy expanded by four percent . according to gyurcsany , hungary 's entry into the european union had been easy going for the nation 's economy and its people . " it seems that a large portion of the country did n't even notice that we joined , " he told german television .
or if they did , he added , it was because " whisky was suddenly cheaper . " gerwald herter -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

but while the main rival , the conservative cdu managed to gain five percent it seems that may not be enough – and all eyes are now on the party of the state ’ s tiny minority of danes in germany who is emerging as the key player . the ssw party representing schleswig-holstein ‘ s danish minority , will become kingmakers after sundays elections – which developed into a cliffhanger as counting went on well into monday morning .
the danish ssw has won two seats , but if they make true their pledge of support for the red-green coalition this could give them a lead of one seat over the opposition . this would then allow the state 's premier , heide simonis , to remain in office of the northern which she has ruled for the past 12 years .
the spd won the decisive election precinct by just 70 votes . cdu still pleased the conservative cdu and their liberal allies are still pleased with their own showing . the cdu emerged the strongest party with about 40 percent of the vote .
this success is a major boost to party leader angela merkel and her bid for the candidacy in the race for chancellor in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " it ’ s a sensational result and it shows that a strong campaign and unity in the party are paying off , " merkel said .

but we will win this state of north-rhine westaphalia in may as well . " disappointment for the spd while it seems that the social democrat led government has scraped through in schleswig-holstein , the outcome was still a disappointment to the spd .
only three months ago opinion polls had predicted a clear victory . nevertheless , party leader franz müntefering sad he saw a silver lining - claiming the party has begun to recover after suffering a string of even worse batterings in state polls last year . " i ’ m convinced this election is also a sign that the social democrats have passed the valley of tears , " he said .
" we have seen the low point last autumn and are now heading towards new victories . " greens survive scandal after strong gains in eastern german state elections last september , the far-right npd party failed to make the 5 percent threshold needed to enter parliament .
the greens ' party leader claudia roth said this is , however , no reason to let up in the fight against the neo-nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " i ’ m very relieved that the voters have shown the red card to the neo-nazis , " she said .

" with about 6 percent the greens were able to win as many votes as 5 years ago – and that in spite of the scandal over unchecked immigration currently engulfing their charismatic figurehead , german foreign minister joschka fischer . the liberals slumped slightly to 6.6 percent .

" this is an important success , " talat told reporters . his party 's showing was a significant advance on the last polls in december 2003 in which it emerged the largest with 35.2 percent of the vote but was forced to form a coalition with the more nationalist democrat party of serdar denktash , son of veteran hardline leader rauf denktash . but the final results still gave his party just 24 of the 50 seats in parliament , two short of a majority , again forcing it to form a coalition . but a 5.8 percent showing for another smaller pro-un plan faction , the peace and democracy party , gave it one mp , offering talat the possibility of a more dovish coalition partner . olive branch to greek cypriots he immediately held out an olive branch to cyprus president tassos papadopoulos , whose majority greek cypriot community overwhelming rejected the un reunification blueprint at his urging in a referendum last april , saying the election result showed the turkish cypriots ' continuing desire for a solution . " i want to call on the greek cypriot side leadership to take our hand , which we are extending in peace to them and we will continue to put our best effort for reconciliation and a solution to the cyprus problem , " he said . talat called on the international community to make good on its promises to reward the turkish cypriot yes vote in last year 's referendum by easing the economic isolation of the breakaway state declared in 1983 but recognized only by ankara . " it is not up to me but up to the international community to help us end the isolation , " he said .
" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

" this is an important success , " talat told reporters . his party 's showing was a significant advance on the last polls in december 2003 in which it emerged the largest with 35.2 percent of the vote but was forced to form a coalition with the more nationalist democrat party of serdar denktash , son of veteran hardline leader rauf denktash . but the final results still gave his party just 24 of the 50 seats in parliament , two short of a majority , again forcing it to form a coalition . but a 5.8 percent showing for another smaller pro-un plan faction , the peace and democracy party , gave it one mp , offering talat the possibility of a more dovish coalition partner . olive branch to greek cypriots he immediately held out an olive branch to cyprus president tassos papadopoulos , whose majority greek cypriot community overwhelming rejected the un reunification blueprint at his urging in a referendum last april , saying the election result showed the turkish cypriots ' continuing desire for a solution . " i want to call on the greek cypriot side leadership to take our hand , which we are extending in peace to them and we will continue to put our best effort for reconciliation and a solution to the cyprus problem , " he said . talat called on the international community to make good on its promises to reward the turkish cypriot yes vote in last year 's referendum by easing the economic isolation of the breakaway state declared in 1983 but recognized only by ankara . " it is not up to me but up to the international community to help us end the isolation , " he said .
" we will use our pressure more decisively and more extensively " to achieve that . eu tries to help turkish north the greek cypriot no vote meant that a divided island joined the european union in may last year , denying the turkish cypriots the full benefits of membership . the european union has since tried to restore direct preferential trade with the turkish cypriots but has run into legal obstacles raised by a 1994 court decision and the opposition of the internationally recognized cyprus government . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , swiftly welcomed the outcome of sunday 's vote , saying : " the results indicate a clear desire of the turkish cypriot community to continue preparations for their full integration into the eu . " the results also show that the turkish cypriots are committed to the reunification of cyprus , " it added . analysts had voiced concern that following the referendum debacle , large numbers of turkish cypriots would stay away from the polls in disillusion , but the electoral commission said turnout was around 80 percent . april presidential elections decisive early elections were called after talat 's two-party coalition lost its slim parliamentary majority last may , shortly after the un reunification plan was voted down . the results were a slap in the face for nationalist former premier dervis eroglu whose right-wing national unity party had been expected to give talat a close run but secured just 31.6percent of the vote and 19 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash getting ready to cast his vote on sunday analysts expressed doubt that the election result would lead to any immediate resumption of the peace process on the island , cautioning that that would have to wait until after presidential elections in april , when hardliner rauf denktash -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down after four decades leading his community . denktash 's center-right democrats won 13.4 percent of the vote and six seats , and the remaining three parties failed to pass the five percent threshold for parliamentary representation . cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup seeking union with greece . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish cypriots face fractured vote turkish cypriots will sunday elect a government for their breakaway state , but the political deadlock gripping their community amid failures to reunite the island is unlikely to cease before presidential polls in april .

khaled el-masri , who is of lebanese descent but has a german passport , claims to have been abducted by us operatives while on holiday in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 .
three weeks later , masri said , he was put on an airplane to afghanistan , where he was shackled , punched and interrogated about extremists at his mosque in ulm , germany .
he further stated that he was released months later and dropped off on a deserted road leading into macedonia .
the case is being investigated by a munich prosecutor as a kidnapping case , the weekly said .
the cia allegedly whisked foreign terror suspects to clandestine interrogation facilities , using a boeing 737 plane specially dedicated for that purpose , newsweek reported sunday .
the allegation , if proven true , is " further evidence that a global ' ghost ' prison system , where terror suspects are secretly interrogated , is being operated by the cia , " the weekly wrote . dw-world.de german group : terror fight violates human rights a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .

a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

a recent study in germany shows that a large-scale flu wave , such as the one now spreading across northern europe , has a visible economic impact . “ over € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- are lost through the spread of the flu , ” said german health economist karl lauterbach in a weekend interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the majority of losses are caused by employee absence and the corresponding decline in productivity . two million sick employees in germany , health professionals have reported a significant increase in the number of people infected by influenza compared to the previous year .
alarm bells are ringing over a major flu wave sweeping across the country .
given the virus ' quick spreading germs , economists estimate that some two million workers will call in sick , with the average employee staying home for five days . “ an average flu epidemic results in approximately two million absent employees every year in germany , ” said boris augurzky , economist at the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- .
when one considers that a lost work day costs approximately € 200 per person , the total sum of lost productivity and revenue for a single day amounts to around € 450 million , including doctor costs , hospital visits and medication , he said . for the entire flu season , which can last through march , costs in germany are expected to easily surpass € 1 billion . stock market shivers in addition to the reduced revenue and productivity , investors also tend to hold back on purchases and investment during the flu season , especially when the virus makes the round in the cities where major stock markets are located . the stock exchanges closely monitor the outbreak of contagious diseases , such as sars or the asian bird flu , which caused the bangkok stock market to drop 15 percent and the hong kong hang-seng-index to fall 10 percent last year .
a major influenza epidemic , which would have considerably higher death rates and strike in major economic regions such as the us and europe , would be catastrophic , said frankfurt-based economist hans-jörg naumer in an interview with die welt newspaper . “ although the markets would recuperate fairly quickly after the flu epidemic runs its course , the psychological uncertainty would be long-lasting , ” naumer said . preventive medicine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an immunization is not 100 percent effective , but it could reduce the number of flu cases and sick days unlike the software updates and anit-virus programs business can download onto their computers , air-born contagious viruses can not be prevented with complete effectiveness .
an immunization can only combat a specific strain of flu virus .
if it mutates or mixes with other viruses , the initial shot is no longer effective . nonetheless , health officials are increasingly recommending flu vaccines for people with frequent public contact or those who work in crowded conditions – such as open office environments .
in most cases the insurance company or the employer covers the cost for the vaccine .
at € 16 per shot , the money is well-invested considering a sick employee accounts for more than 10 times that amount . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de si , si - schröder 's sick the flu strikes even those in high places like german chancellor gerhard schröder who was forced to cancel several high-profile appearances and stay in bed .

london councils are under pressure to meet government targets councils across london are using innovative ways to encourage residents to recycle more household waste .
londoners recycle just 11 % of their rubbish - a figure which must reach 25 % by 2005 to meet government targets .
recent figures show tower hamlets , newham , hackney and barking and dagenham are among the 10 worst councils for recycling in england .
bins fitted with barcodes , recycling boxes with weight sensors and even £ 1,000 fines are among the tactics being used to boost recycling .
prove commitment councils are facing close scrutiny after the government published local authority recycling and composting rates for 2003/04 in january .
they have until march to prove their commitment to the department for the environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- or face intervention by teams of advisors .
the best recyclers sutton hillingdon richmond upon thames bexley bromley camden london corporation kinston-upon-thames wandsworth west london waste authority in the north london borough of barnet , it will be compulsory for every resident after 1 march to recycle glass bottles , jars , tins , cans , paper and magazines or face a £ 1,000 fine .
it is hoped this will drastically increase the amount recycled through the council 's kerbside collection scheme .
southwark council in south london has been awarded £ 34.5m of government money to help build a state of the art treatment station .
the facility will remove recyclable materials from household waste then process the rest into soil conditioner or fuel .
high-rise flats for the 2,000 people living in tower blocks in clapham park in south london , a doorstep collection of recyclables was introduced offering residents an alternative to carrying items to the ground floor .
this proved a success as household recycling on the estate increased eight-fold .
tower hamlets had the worst recycling rate in london , attributed largely to the number of high-rise flats .
barcodes will be used to identify areas with poor recycling levels the council said it recognised there was " a lot of work to do to encourage local people to recycle rubbish " .
last year an extra 15,000 homes were added to the doorstep recycling scheme , taking the total number to 45,000 , of which 57 % take part .
an extensive programme of education has also been launched .
south london 's croydon council has fitted every waste bin with a microchip which calculates the weight of rubbish being collected .
this allows the council to identify areas that have lower levels of recycling which can then be targeted with leaflet campaigns .
over 100,000 homes , out of a possible 135,000 , have green recycling boxes and they hope to provide 65 new mini-recycling sites for flats by april .
an appliance reuse centre is also to open where white goods and furniture will be reused and supplied to charities and local groups .
the worst recyclers tower hamlets newham barking and dagenham hackney southwark islington east london waste authority lewisham brent haringey bexley council in south-east london fared well in the recent figures but a system of bar-coding has been introduced to further improve their figures .
all recycling bins and boxes have a barcode sticker which will be scanned to gauge recycling rates .
the information will be used to target resources and information at those areas that will benefit most and to monitor the effectiveness of collections .
however the council stressed that " details on the recycling habits of individual households can not be gathered reliably using the system and this is not the reason the scanners are being introduced . "

london councils are under pressure to meet government targets councils across london are using innovative ways to encourage residents to recycle more household waste .
londoners recycle just 11 % of their rubbish - a figure which must reach 25 % by 2005 to meet government targets .
recent figures show tower hamlets , newham , hackney and barking and dagenham are among the 10 worst councils for recycling in england .
bins fitted with barcodes , recycling boxes with weight sensors and even £ 1,000 fines are among the tactics being used to boost recycling .
prove commitment councils are facing close scrutiny after the government published local authority recycling and composting rates for 2003/04 in january .
they have until march to prove their commitment to the department for the environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- or face intervention by teams of advisors .
the best recyclers sutton hillingdon richmond upon thames bexley bromley camden london corporation kinston-upon-thames wandsworth west london waste authority in the north london borough of barnet , it will be compulsory for every resident after 1 march to recycle glass bottles , jars , tins , cans , paper and magazines or face a £ 1,000 fine .
it is hoped this will drastically increase the amount recycled through the council 's kerbside collection scheme .
southwark council in south london has been awarded £ 34.5m of government money to help build a state of the art treatment station .
the facility will remove recyclable materials from household waste then process the rest into soil conditioner or fuel .
high-rise flats for the 2,000 people living in tower blocks in clapham park in south london , a doorstep collection of recyclables was introduced offering residents an alternative to carrying items to the ground floor .
this proved a success as household recycling on the estate increased eight-fold .
tower hamlets had the worst recycling rate in london , attributed largely to the number of high-rise flats .
barcodes will be used to identify areas with poor recycling levels the council said it recognised there was " a lot of work to do to encourage local people to recycle rubbish " .
last year an extra 15,000 homes were added to the doorstep recycling scheme , taking the total number to 45,000 , of which 57 % take part .
an extensive programme of education has also been launched .
south london 's croydon council has fitted every waste bin with a microchip which calculates the weight of rubbish being collected .
this allows the council to identify areas that have lower levels of recycling which can then be targeted with leaflet campaigns .
over 100,000 homes , out of a possible 135,000 , have green recycling boxes and they hope to provide 65 new mini-recycling sites for flats by april .
an appliance reuse centre is also to open where white goods and furniture will be reused and supplied to charities and local groups .
the worst recyclers tower hamlets newham barking and dagenham hackney southwark islington east london waste authority lewisham brent haringey bexley council in south-east london fared well in the recent figures but a system of bar-coding has been introduced to further improve their figures .
all recycling bins and boxes have a barcode sticker which will be scanned to gauge recycling rates .
the information will be used to target resources and information at those areas that will benefit most and to monitor the effectiveness of collections .
however the council stressed that " details on the recycling habits of individual households can not be gathered reliably using the system and this is not the reason the scanners are being introduced . "

last year an extra 15,000 homes were added to the doorstep recycling scheme , taking the total number to 45,000 , of which 57 % take part .
an extensive programme of education has also been launched .
south london 's croydon council has fitted every waste bin with a microchip which calculates the weight of rubbish being collected .
this allows the council to identify areas that have lower levels of recycling which can then be targeted with leaflet campaigns .
over 100,000 homes , out of a possible 135,000 , have green recycling boxes and they hope to provide 65 new mini-recycling sites for flats by april .
an appliance reuse centre is also to open where white goods and furniture will be reused and supplied to charities and local groups .
the worst recyclers tower hamlets newham barking and dagenham hackney southwark islington east london waste authority lewisham brent haringey bexley council in south-east london fared well in the recent figures but a system of bar-coding has been introduced to further improve their figures .
all recycling bins and boxes have a barcode sticker which will be scanned to gauge recycling rates .
the information will be used to target resources and information at those areas that will benefit most and to monitor the effectiveness of collections .
however the council stressed that " details on the recycling habits of individual households can not be gathered reliably using the system and this is not the reason the scanners are being introduced . "

he was speaking on bbc radio cymru 's news magazine programme , llinyn mesur .
the council will discuss its proposals on tuesday , at the start of a six-week consultation period .
mr owens said the period could be extended in order for all interested parties to express their viewpoints .
the authority has said that falling pupil numbers meant there would be around 1,600 empty places by 2006 . "
i am opposed to the closure of the schools " cllr dewi owens speaking later on sunday to bbc news online , mr owens said : " i am opposed to the closure of the schools and i hope we can find another way of keeping them open .
" i was also surprised at the scale of the closures , but i have the corporate responsibility for all schools in denbighshire .
" if we ca n't get the money from the welsh assembly government and we ca n't see a way forward then we 'll have to close them .
but hopefully not on the scale proposed at the moment . "
and , he added : " perhaps we can look at building more homes in rural areas to keep schools open .
but this is not cut and dried , this is a consultation document . "
parents of pupils from two denbighshire primary schools threatened with closure have said they will fight the plans every step of the way .
the villagers from llandegla and bryneglwys met last thursday night to plan their campaign .

they said they needed a new school to be built in the village .
campaigners are urging other parents to study the council 's proposals and to write in with their opinions .
they also plan to lobby councillors at a cabinet meeting at the council headquarters on tuesday .
denbighshire council has insisted no final decisions have been taken and has promised to consult with all those affected .
if the proposed closure and merger plans go ahead , three new schools would be built in prestatyn , ruthin and rhyl .
the council has 52 schools under its control .
it said there was overcrowding in some coastal schools and empty places in others .
parents concerned over the planned closure of denbighshire schools will hand in 200 letters of objection to the council on monday .
the letters are all written by parents and villagers from llandegla and bryneglwys .
they will also hand in a 264 signature petition calling for the schools to stay open .

dewi owens , cabinet member for lifelong learning at denbighshire council , said the scale of the changes surprised him .
he was speaking on bbc radio cymru 's news magazine programme , llinyn mesur .
the council will discuss its proposals on tuesday , at the start of a six-week consultation period .
mr owens said the period could be extended in order for all interested parties to express their viewpoints .
the authority has said that falling pupil numbers meant there would be around 1,600 empty places by 2006 .
i am opposed to the closure of the schools cllr dewi owens speaking later on sunday to bbc news online , mr owens said : " i am opposed to the closure of the schools and i hope we can find another way of keeping them open .
" i was also surprised at the scale of the closures , but i have the corporate responsibility for all schools in denbighshire .
" if we ca n't get the money from the welsh assembly government and we ca n't see a way forward then we 'll have to close them .
but hopefully not on the scale proposed at the moment . "
and , he added : " perhaps we can look at building more homes in rural areas to keep schools open .
but this is not cut and dried , this is a consultation document . "
parents of pupils from two denbighshire primary schools threatened with closure have said they will fight the plans every step of the way .
the villagers from llandegla and bryneglwys met last thursday night to plan their campaign .
denbighshire council has said 10 schools would be closed or merged in a first phase , and another four later on .
the parents , who met in llandegla to plan their next step , denied that numbers were falling at their school .

they said they needed a new school to be built in the village .
campaigners are urging other parents to study the council 's proposals and to write in with their opinions .
they also plan to lobby councillors at a cabinet meeting at the council headquarters on tuesday .
denbighshire council has insisted no final decisions have been taken and has promised to consult with all those affected .
if the proposed closure and merger plans go ahead , three new schools would be built in prestatyn , ruthin and rhyl .
the council has 52 schools under its control .
it said there was overcrowding in some coastal schools and empty places in others .
parents concerned over the planned closure of denbighshire schools will hand in 200 letters of objection to the council on monday .
the letters are all written by parents and villagers from llandegla and bryneglwys .
they will also hand in a 264 signature petition calling for the schools to stay open .

the interview was recorded with cultural historian peter stead for the bbc in 2000 .
in it , charles gives his views on modern football and on his time in italy , where he was nicknamed " il buono gigante " - the gentle giant .
charles died aged 72 after falling ill while on a promotional tour of italy .
swansea-born charles started his career with leeds united , scoring more than 150 goals in eight years , including 42 in the 1953-4 season .
he moved to italian giants juventus for a then-record fee of £ 67,000 in 1957 .
despite the high-profile move and his hero status in italy , charles did not earn riches from football .
but in the bbc interview , charles - whose life is currently being celebrated in an exhibition at the national library of wales - said that although he was a fan of modern football , he appreciated his own time in the game .
that was the only thing you lived for , to put on the shirt of wales .
john charles charles said : " i would have liked to play now , but i like to think that what i did , i enjoyed .
" never mind about the money , money did n't come into it then .
" you wanted to play football and you played football .
" i was a young lad in swansea and i went to leeds and then juventus - it was marvellous .
" there was no great reward really , the only reward was when you won . "
in italy , playing for juventus , charles scored 93 goals in 155 matches , inspiring the turin club to three championships and the italian cup .
charles , who was among the first british footballers to play abroad , remains a sporting hero in italy .
in the interview , charles said his five seasons at juventus represented the pinnacle of his long career .
he said : " it was great to play for them because we had a good team .
" they were great years , wonderful .
i enjoyed it so much . "
explaining the team 's success , charles said : " the only thing i can think of is that they played to me at juventus .
john and glenda charles at home " there was me and a little argentinian called -lrb- omar -rrb- sivori and we played very well together .
" we had an italian called -lrb- giampiero -rrb- boniperti in midfield and he was a great passer of a ball and i think that 's what made us really . "
after five years and 93 goals , he returned briefly to leeds , then went to roma , before ending his playing career with cardiff .
charles ' international career with wales saw him take his place in possibly the country 's greatest national team , which qualified for the 1958 world cup in sweden .
but injury deprived wales of their best player for the quarter final clash with a pele-inspired brazil , who triumphed 1-0 .
charles acknowledged that his absence was a crucial factor in wales ' defeat .
he said : " i think maybe , although we 'll never know , if i did play we might have beaten them . "
charles finished his international career with 15 goals in 38 appearances and spoke of his pride in playing for wales , particularly against england .
physical size he said : " that was the only thing you lived for , to put on the shirt of wales .
" it was marvellous to beat england .
" it was always very close , because we had a good side then and england was a good side as well . "
despite his formidable physical size and footballing skill that allowed him to play both in defence and attack , charles attributed his success to his willingness to practise which saw him regularly train alone in an attempt to improve .
charles said : " when i was at leeds , i used to go back for two hours in the afternoon and practise doing one thing like taking free kicks or heading the ball and i used to do it by myself .
" i wanted to be a good player and if i did n't do that , i do n't think i would have been . "

the report will focus on max palmer , 10 , from fleetwood , lancashire , who was swept away in a small flooded river near glenridding , cumbria , in may 2002 .
teacher paul ellis pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was jailed for one year last september .
the hse said their advice would provide practical advice for teachers taking groups of pupils on educational trips .
' pool plunge ' max , a pupil at fleetwood primary school , was with his mother who was helping on a trip organised by fleetwood high school when he got into difficulties and drowned in cold , fast-flowing water in glenridding beck .
mr ellis took the pupils on the adventure weekend , where pupils were " pool plunging " in the beck .
he was described as " grossly negligent " for allowing max into the water .
justin mccracken , deputy director general of the hse , said school trips were a vital part of a child 's education .
' risk aware ' " adventure activities provide the ideal opportunity to make children ' risk aware ' by involving them in practical decision-making in challenging environments , " he said .
" hse 's views , and its recommendations following its investigation of the glenridding tragedy , mirror those of the commons education select committee .
" hse will continue to champion the message that sensible health and safety is about managing risk rather than eliminating it . "

research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide .
the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations .
but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites .
recycle , re-use the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk .
of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year , only 25 % get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use .
the slowly growing mass of unrecycled , discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets , the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste , estimates james goodman , report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future .
" it 's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around , " said mr goodman .
many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world , said mr goodman .
far better , he said , to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life .
" we 've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back , " said mr goodman , " but there 's a strong social argument too . "
older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model .
the forum for the future report took an in-depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular .
" it 's an interesting country because it has a fixed line network less developed than the east european average , " said mr goodman , " and there 's a real desire for people to get mobile phones . "
but the relatively low wages in romania , which is one of the poorest countries in europe , mean few people can afford a shiny new phone .
" the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one , " he said .
reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets .
the re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset .
georgeta minciu , a romanian part-time cleaner , said : " normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages .
i am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me . "
" this is the only way i can afford to have a phone , " she said .
mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain 's mobile mountain made it overseas .
but , he added , those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset .
" if its more than a few years old people are not going to want it , " he said .

but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites .
recycle , re-use the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk .
of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year , only 25 % get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use .
the slowly growing mass of unrecycled , discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets , the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste , estimates james goodman , report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future .
" it 's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around , " said mr goodman .
a mobile phone is a status symbol in many nations many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world , said mr goodman .
far better , he said , to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life .
" we 've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back , " said mr goodman , " but there 's a strong social argument too . "
older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model .
the forum for the future report took an in-depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular .
" it 's an interesting country because it has a fixed line network less developed than the east european average , " said mr goodman , " and there 's a real desire for people to get mobile phones . "
but the relatively low wages in romania , which is one of the poorest countries in europe , mean few people can afford a shiny new phone .
" the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one , " he said .
reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets .
the re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset .
georgeta minciu , a romanian part-time cleaner , said : " normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages .
i am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me . "
" this is the only way i can afford to have a phone , " she said .
mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain 's mobile mountain made it overseas .
but , he added , those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset .
" if its more than a few years old people are not going to want it , " he said .

the sunday times reported that hedge funds tci and atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group 's chairman and chief executive .
but deutsche boerse told news agency reuters such a move would have to wait until may 's annual general meeting .
investors want deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid .
" we are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management .
we are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time , " atticus ' david slager told the sunday times .
however , deutsche boerse told reuters : " tci 's request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on may 25 . "
replacement moves the sunday times reported that tci had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace deutsche 's chairman rolf breuer and chief executive werner seifert .
the group owns more than 5 % of deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the german exchange 's management .
under german law deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid .
tci and atticus have opposed the lse bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value , and would be better spent on a share buyback .
deutsche is in competition with pan-european bourse euronext to take over the london exchange .
many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out .
however , any such move would have to wait until march when the office of fair trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair 's takeover proposals .

the sunday times reported that hedge funds tci and atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group 's chairman and chief executive .
but deutsche boerse told news agency reuters such a move would have to wait until may 's annual general meeting .
investors want deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid .
" we are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management .

however , deutsche boerse told reuters : " tci 's request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on may 25 . "
replacement moves the sunday times reported that tci had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace deutsche 's chairman rolf breuer and chief executive werner seifert .
the group owns more than 5 % of deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the german exchange 's management .
under german law deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid .
tci and atticus have opposed the lse bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value , and would be better spent on a share buyback .
deutsche is in competition with pan-european bourse euronext to take over the london exchange .
many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out .
however , any such move would have to wait until march when the office of fair trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair 's takeover proposals .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- comic aims to rock the oscars bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture monday , 21 february , 2005 , 09:13 gmt comic aims to rock the oscars the decision to hire chris rock as the presenter of the oscars was seen as a bold move by organisers , mainly because of the near-the-knuckle material of his stand-up shows .
that and his propensity to swear and curse throughout his routines .
us tv networks have been under siege lately to make everything family friendly , with any misdemeanour thrown under into spotlight .
but rock himself says he is not worried that he will curse live on air .
" i 'm never proper or careful but i never curse in front of my mum , either . "
the 40-year-old 's comedy may not yet have the international reputation of his predecessors steve martin or billy crystal but he has carved himself out a massive fan base in the us .
and like martin and crystal , he has made the move into films , playing a black president in head of state and a reincarnated man in the remake of down to earth .
it was his quick wit and ability to shock a room into laughter that first brought him fame .
blacks and whites are his targets in equal measure , with jokes few could get away with in today 's climate of political correctness .
in this regard he is often compared to richard pryor , one of his comedy idols .
his early years growing up in bedford-stuyvesant in brooklyn moulded rock into the comic he is today .
he stills lives in the same district .
one of seven siblings with a strict father , rock went to a largely white school as part of a project to " bus " black kids to better schools to encourage integration .
fast food jobs he was bullied at school and education was not a top priority for rock , who dropped out to work in fast food chains while trying to get a foot on the comedy circuit .
he hung around the comic strip club in new york where eddie murphy had honed his routine hoping to get an occasional gig .
other comic strip alumni included jerry seinfeld , ray romano and adam sandler .
from there , rock got his big break on saturday night live , the breeding ground for many of today 's top comics including jim belushi , chevy chase and bill murray .
at the age of 24 he was seen as having great potential but , by his own admission , he squandered his big chance and launched himself head first into the showbusiness lifestyle , with women particularly taking his eye off the game .
he left saturday night live to work on a mainly black show called in living colour .
but it was cancelled after one season and rock was back where he started .
settling down he realised he needed to knuckle down so he went back and finely tuned his stage act .
he also settled his personal life down , marrying long-term girlfriend malaak compton , the mother of his two children .
with his more stable attitude came his own tv show , called the chris rock show , a chat and sketch show , which ran from 1997 to 2000 and saw him collect an emmy award for best writing .
while thousands flock to catch his rock live show , it is his hbo specials and the phenomenal sales of his videoes , dvds and live albums that have given him a wider audience .
his film career began with a bit part in eddie murphy 's beverley hills cop ii and has been up and down since , with roles in gritty movies such as new jack city and a turn in the remake of sgt bilko .
but he has a lead part in the upcoming the longest yard alongside adam sandler , and a voice part in the star-studded zoo tale madagascar with ben stiller and david schwimmer .
and , rock already has his own star on the hollywood walk of fame .
the academy awards will put rock on a truly international platform but he realises the night is not about him and that , despite this , he needs to hook the audience from the outset .
" a great monologue does it , " he says .
" the secret to hosting awards shows is like sports - get a big lead and run out the clock .
then kind of hand off the ball and assist the show . "
he also hopes to call on his friends like murphy and sandler .
" i 've been kissing * * * for years and now i 'm going to reap the rewards , " he jokes .
" i 've been paying for a lot of dinners and now i want jokes , damn it ! "

the 40-year-old 's comedy may not yet have the international reputation of his predecessors steve martin or billy crystal but he has carved himself out a massive fan base in the us .

settling down he realised he needed to knuckle down so he went back and finely tuned his stage act .

with his more stable attitude came his own tv show , called the chris rock show , a chat and sketch show , which ran from 1997 to 2000 and saw him collect an emmy award for best writing .

home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 21 february , 2005 , 09:23 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version should london host the olympics ?
the assessment of the bid for a london olympics in 2012 is completed on saturday .
after four days studying london 's bid , visiting the proposed sites and dining with dignitaries the international olympic committee 's 16-strong evaluation team will prepare its report ahead of the vote on 6 july .
london is competing with paris , madrid , moscow and new york to host the games .
the bid team is promoting london 's multiculturalism as a leading strength - but is their enthusiasm matched outside the capital ?
are you backing the bid for london ?
will the facilities be white elephants once the games are over ?
does another part of the uk have a stronger case ?
which of the five shortlisted cities is your best bet to win ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received so far : yes i want the olympics here in london , and i feel we should get them too .
we have not had the games since 1948 , far too long to wait !
i feel that despite all the concerns about the transport being overcrowded already , they do seem committed to improving it , and if that is the only way / time we 'll get such improvements then bring it on .
samantha marshall , london , uk why on earth would i back the bid ?
i wo n't see any more of the olympics than if they were hosted in another country .
the only involvement i 'll have is that my money will end up paying for it !
yet another london-focused event that somehow we 're all supposed to be ecstatic about .
no , thank you .
christy , newcastle , uk why is n't there a clamour to support london in it 's 2012 olympic bid ?
we 've all seen how great the sydney and athens olympics were , if we could support the bid and deliver a games near to as good as those it would be something special to everyone in this country .
instead of everyone moaning how bad everything is about the bid just support it and be happy we 're even considered with all the pessisimistic attitudes .
jonny c , port talbot , south wales we have a great chance of hosting a really exciting event gina , cambridge , uk i 'm really surprised and disappointed to see so many negative comments about london hosting the games .
it 's important not to be naive about plans which can , and do , fail sometimes , but the british seem to take cynicism to a new level !
why ca n't we all get behind this campaign ?
we have a great chance of hosting a really exciting event and showing the world that we can put on a brilliant show .
hosting the games would benefit the whole country in terms of tourism , and they 're also planning to relocate structures away from london afterwards ..
gina , cambridge , uk i think it is totally inappropriate for a country which closes schools , local post-offices and hospital wings down , because we can not afford to run them and yet we can spend billions on a sports event which lasts two weeks !
are there any guarantees that we can earn money from this event through the tourism and business we hope to gain ?
gerald hone , swansea no .
and why is there no opportunity to vote on the london 2012 website ?
i object to public money being used to market an expensive gimmick for which londoners will have to pay .
the first question should have been " does the country support it ? "
if there was general support then it might be reasonable to use taxpayers ' money in the bid .
since there is not general support , it is obscene to use taxpayers ' money to try to convince them to support it .
clare , london athens 2004 was great ... for sport and for public transport , but not for tax payers .
my heart says yes , my head no .
shona , london , uk come on london !
one of the world 's greatest cities hosting one of the world 's greatest events .
i think london has an excellent chance of winning the bid .
david , dorset , uk the money spent in hosting the games could be far better spent on the nhs , education , transport , the armed forces , and law enforcement agencies stuart read , romford , essex i hope we do n't get the games as i feel that both new york and paris would be better suited , for a start both cities have far better and more affordable public transport systems than london .
secondly , the americans are far better at staging world events -lrb- see previous summer and winter games , world cups etc -rrb- thirdly the money spent in hosting the games could be far better spent on the nhs , education , transport , the armed forces , and law enforcement agencies .
lastly and most importantly we would be left with untold white elephants , once the games were finished which every londoner would have to pay for , by means of council taxes .
stuart read , romford , essex we could do it , but as someone points out any big public sector projects costs far more than budgeted .
we spend more , run late , then argue for years .
perhaps it could be run by someone outside of the control of the politicians ?
dave m , crewe , cheshire in a word , no .
draconian firearms restrictions the labour party forced through mean that all shooting events will have to be held outside the uk .
so this gives the olympic committee a tailor-made excuse .
andrew milner , yokohama , japan if all the new infrastructure can be provided for the games , why ca n't it be provided for us now ?
the only people to benefit will be the sort of people who would not think of earning a living by producing something of real value .
jim roper , weymouth , uk as a londoner i 'm hopeful that we will host the 2012 olympic games .
we should as a nation get behind this and show were a proud country .
england can and will show the rest of the world that we can put on a spectacular games , one never to be forgotten .
jaye , london i think this is an opportunity to make this country great once again .
this country has been lacking in pride and honour .
the work done for the olympics in london will unite us the fantastic achievements that can be made by this country .
we must also take into account that some events are not just located within london but in wales , scotland and the rest of england .
this means that the country 's transport links are greatly improved , our security is tested improving our future capability and our sports venues and education facilities are improved to the highest degree ensuring a lasting legacy to the future of great britain .
great britain - that is what all visitors will remember .
james smith , bristol i am tired of being told in every tube train , bus stop and bus that i should make london proud paul , southend i am pretty tired of being told i should " back the bid " .
it is not that i dislike the olympics , sports or athletes ; i just feel that the short lived public euphoria born from a few medals falls short of providing a benefit that justifies the cost .
i am tired of being told in every tube train , bus stop and bus that i should make london proud .
paul , southend it 's amazing to see how many brits do n't want the games .
this is a fantastic event and will promote london on the world stage .
the british public as always seem intent on being negative and pessimistic .
will -lrb- expat pomme -rrb- , melbourne , australia as a nation we can not afford to host the olympics .
if the billions can be found for this it should be used to help the deprived areas and not a few business men who will make millions .
r hawksworth , north lincolnshire oh , when will british people stop moaning , get behind a british project and support it wholeheartedly , without being pessimistic or ironic about it .
i bet you anything the french and the americans do n't question whether the olympics should go to their country one single bit .
i really hope london wins the bid .
i certainly will be cheering on !
raluca , brit in the states should the olympics come here ?
absolutely .
i 'd say we have the strongest sporting history of any country in the world .
there is no better place for it .
paul preece , epsom , uk for goodness sake let give it a go , have the games and put all the negatives on the back burner , we have the backing of our queen and the princess royal , which is more than prince charles has so we must be on a winner for once !
jill mclaughlin , liverpool , england in a word , no .
draconian firearms restrictions the labour party forced through mean that all shooting events will have to be held outside the uk .
so this gives the olympic committee a tailor-made excuse .
andrew milner , yokohama , japan as a londoner i 'm hopeful that we will host the 2012 olympic games .
we should as a nation get behind this and show we 're a proud country .
england can and will show the rest of the world that we can put on a spectacular games , one never to be forgotten .
jaye , london the transport system ca n't cope as it is , despite the fact we 're being told it will cope in the future and is getting better everyday .
this i have yet to see !
it would be nice to have , but an absolute nightmare ...
on average , it can take an hour to get across london as it is , can you imagine what it will be like with the olympics on as well ?
nice idea , and it really would be nice , but not in london ...
ken , herts , uk the olympic committee should take heed of the words of one alan partridge : ' go to london and you 'll either be mugged or not appreciated ! '
sam , chester , uk of course we want the olympics in the uk and where better then our capital city .
i wish all the doom and gloom merchants would keep their mouths shut !
keith , stonehouse , glos i think people have forgotten london exists , it has been that long since it has hosted a major sporting event .
tom green , scunthorpe i remember the festival of britain and the abiding goodwill it left in the hearts and minds of the thousands who visited that great exhibition .
imagine , then , what the olympics could achieve in 2012 !
we have a country to be proud of , and the benefits of a hugely successful games will become part of our future .
christopher sewell , deal , england many moons ago there was a dome , a millennium dome , filled with many of the same promises as are heralded by the olympics , yet millions was wasted on an ill-fated venture .
our health service is ailing , our transport links are struggling and our postal service is doomed .
money set aside for the olympics would be much better spent getting our own house in order before welcoming the world through our front door .
sally , sussex , england i hope they 're planning a lot of covered stadia for this event .
if not to protect against the weather , then perhaps to protect athletes from london 's disgusting-smelling air .
ian , brit in usa if london is awarded the olympics , the first thing most ' residents ' -lrb- remember them ? -rrb- will notice is the enormous rise in house prices , rental costs and the cost of living .
businesses and property owners must be rubbing their hands with glee .
what 's the point of hosting the games if the only people who will benefit are those wealthy enough to remain ?
tazzy , london , uk a wide boy on every street corner waiting to fleece the tourists paul , leicester i would love to be able to witness an event such as the olympic games and where better than a beautiful city like paris ?
two events for the price of one , and as for london it 's overcrowded , dirty , and a wide boy on every street corner waiting to fleece the tourists .
paul , leicester naturally , i 'm hopeful the olympics come to this country .
where , exactly , is n't an issue for me .
however , i conjure up embarrassing pictures of the chaos we 've come to expect when we attempt anything second nature to our european neighbours .
on the opening day , leaves on the tracks will probably bring all trains in and out of the capital to a halt and pubs and restaurants will be denied extended licensing hours just when the rest of the normal world could do with a drink or two .
welcome to try-hard britain !
patrick v. staton , guildford , uk why does everything always revolve around london ?
there are plenty of venues and big stadiums in the north of england that could more than likely put a better show on than in london .
shaun , leeds why are there no really deprived places on the shortlist ?
julia hayward , st neots , uk london 's bid seemed to be based on the fact that we have n't already got the facilities , and getting the olympics will help regenerate deprived areas .
if that 's the case , why are there no really deprived places on the shortlist ?
why not use the money behind the games to assist developing countries , rather than already over-developed ones ?
julia hayward , st neots , uk it will be a marvellous opportunity for britain 's sports and to show the world what a great and beautiful city london now is .
visitors will be able to marvel at london 's skyline as they stroll along the walkways and enjoy hospitality in the regenerated areas along the banks of the thames .
none of the other competitors has a better case and it 's really not helpful to discuss competition within the uk at this stage .
john m , lyne meads , uk the games will be an expensive nuisance in london which lacks the transport infrastructure for current activities .
it would be better to spend any money on improved transport services rather than grandiose events for vips .
most of us will view the games on tv anyway .
i hear echoes of the dome in all the puffery for the bid , which is itself a total waste of public money .
p hutchinson , wantage , england london for sure !
it will be a much needed incentive and opportunity to fix up the transport - tidy up and get ready to show the world that london really is the most exciting city to be in ! !
james , bournemouth , uk moscow should get the opportunity to present the world its new character shamintha jayatilaka , bristol london 's public transport is already overcrowded and outdated , compared to other cities such as vienna .
the london area is vast making it impossible for spectators coming from abroad to travel without complications to the sites .
the threat from terrorists at the crowded tube stations makes it impossible for me to support the bid .
instead moscow should get the opportunity to present the world its new character .
shamintha jayatilaka , bristol , avon i certainly hope london gets the olympics and i 'm a bit sick of doom merchants who do n't want to see anything good for our country .
sydney made a profit and despite all their troubles , greece is heading for a profit too .
unfortunately no other part of britain has the international pulling power to ever have chance of hosting the olympics .
phil tatler , stoke-on-trent us british have a proven record for going hugely over-budget and generally messing things up when it comes big public projects .
let someone else do a good job of it !
gw , london , england yes london should host the olympics , this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity .
george nipah , london , england i think the games are an extravaganza we can do without .
i am sure that the leeds , nottingham , manchester triangle would benefit to a greater extent .
in any event i reckon that paris stands the best chance .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk i hope the olympics do not go to london .
it 's common knowledge that these things never generate as much money as they cost .
all that money could be far better spent investing in other parts of the uk , instead of promoting london , yet again .
london may be the capital city , but it 's time we stopped over-emphasising its importance .
