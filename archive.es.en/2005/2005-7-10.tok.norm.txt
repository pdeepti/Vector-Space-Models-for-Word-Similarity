they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .

the bombs were planted by french agents , in response to greenpeace 's protests against the french nuclear testing program in the pacific . french president francois mitterand gave the go-ahead for the attack , le monde newspaper in france reported saturday , quoting from a document written by then secret service -lrb- dgse -rrb- chief admiral pierre lacoste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois mitterrand " i asked the president if he would authorize me to conduct the project of neutralisation that i had studied at the request of -lrb- defense minister charles -rrb- hernu .
he gave me his consent while emphasizing the importance he placed on the nuclear tests , " wrote lacoste , then head of the general directorate for external security -lrb- dgse -rrb- .
" i then went into great detail on the project , the authorization was sufficiently explicit . " earlier on may 6 , 1985 , lacoste had met with hernu to outline the plan to sabotage the greenpeace ship .
" far from being shocked by the idea of sabotage in the dock at auckland , " wrote the admiral " he made light of my reservations and encouraged me in that direction , repeating that it was an issue essential to defence policy . " " they -lrb- greenpeace -rrb- want to make war with us , we are at war , we must n't have scruples on such vital subjects , i take full responsibility , " the admiral quoted hernu as saying . silent tribute the demonstrators in paris , wearing the rainbow colors of the organization , had come from about 15 countries and sat or knelt in silence on the esplanade of the trocadero , across the river seine from the eiffel tower , to form the symbol and mark the event . " we want to send a message of hope and an appeal for peace , " yannick jadot , campaigns director for greenpeace france , said .
he called on " international leaders immediately to stop wasting astronomical sums on developing their atomic bombs " and devote instead " their resources to an action programme to promote peace , combat climate change , preserve forests and save the oceans . " in new zealand members of the original crew gathered to pay tribute to their colleague who died in the explosions and to appeal for world peace . the original skipper pete willcox dived 25 meters to where the wreck of the boat now lies and placed a memorial sculpture on the bridge , while above pereira 's daughter marelle cast flowers into the water . in paris a ship 's bell tolled twice , at the moment the two mines placed in the boat exploded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.07.2005 german police uniforms made in belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ordering from belarus saves the police money human rights activists are complaining that the german government , which restricts diplomatic ties with belarus due to its human rights situation , still buy its police uniforms from europe 's last dictatorship . at a roadside spot-check in the german state of hesse , the police officers are stopping cars to see if they 're roadworthy .
they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

the bombs were planted by french agents , in response to greenpeace 's protests against the french nuclear testing program in the pacific . french president francois mitterand gave the go-ahead for the attack , le monde newspaper in france reported saturday , quoting from a document written by then secret service -lrb- dgse -rrb- chief admiral pierre lacoste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois mitterrand " i asked the president if he would authorize me to conduct the project of neutralisation that i had studied at the request of -lrb- defense minister charles -rrb- hernu .
he gave me his consent while emphasizing the importance he placed on the nuclear tests , " wrote lacoste , then head of the general directorate for external security -lrb- dgse -rrb- .
" i then went into great detail on the project , the authorization was sufficiently explicit . " earlier on may 6 , 1985 , lacoste had met with hernu to outline the plan to sabotage the greenpeace ship .
" far from being shocked by the idea of sabotage in the dock at auckland , " wrote the admiral " he made light of my reservations and encouraged me in that direction , repeating that it was an issue essential to defence policy . " " they -lrb- greenpeace -rrb- want to make war with us , we are at war , we must n't have scruples on such vital subjects , i take full responsibility , " the admiral quoted hernu as saying . silent tribute the demonstrators in paris , wearing the rainbow colors of the organization , had come from about 15 countries and sat or knelt in silence on the esplanade of the trocadero , across the river seine from the eiffel tower , to form the symbol and mark the event . " we want to send a message of hope and an appeal for peace , " yannick jadot , campaigns director for greenpeace france , said .
he called on " international leaders immediately to stop wasting astronomical sums on developing their atomic bombs " and devote instead " their resources to an action programme to promote peace , combat climate change , preserve forests and save the oceans . " in new zealand members of the original crew gathered to pay tribute to their colleague who died in the explosions and to appeal for world peace . the original skipper pete willcox dived 25 meters to where the wreck of the boat now lies and placed a memorial sculpture on the bridge , while above pereira 's daughter marelle cast flowers into the water . in paris a ship 's bell tolled twice , at the moment the two mines placed in the boat exploded .
demonstrators then transformed their peace symbol into a rainbow , displaying a banner proclaiming : " you ca n't sink a rainbow .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .

but scott-lee would not elaborate on the nature of the alarm . he put the threat in the context of the broader global climate on terrorism , saying it was unrelated to the suspicious packages which were found and turned out to be harmless .
" it was not a false threat .
it was a serious threat .
the intelligence indicated that the people of birmingham were in danger last night .
and we responded to make sure that the people were taken out of the danger area , " he said . police had lifted the cordon on incoming traffic to the inner ring road of britain 's second-city but confirmed searches were ongoing .
they said the threat was probably not connected to thursday 's bomb attacks in the british capital and that the decision to close a large part birmingham and evacuate an estimated 20,000 people had not been taken lightly . police searched bars , restaurants and clubs in an area known as the golden mile , frisking patrons as they came and went . london death toll britain 's interior minister , charles clarke , said on sunday that he expected the death toll from the london bomb attacks to rise and that he was optimistic the perpetrators eventually would be caught .
however , he said he feared more attacks if they remained at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we think it 's likely to be more than 50 " people killed , home secretary clarke told bbc television .
several dead have yet to be recovered as crews work to clear the wreckage of some underground train carriages .
more than 20 people are still missing . police said on saturday that they had made no arrests and had yet to focus on any particular suspect .
" i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " clarke said .
" i am very optimistic indeed .
i think the track record of our security services in bringing people to justice is good . " but he said he feared the possibility of further attacks if the bombers remained at large .
" that is why the number one priority has to be the catching of the perpetrators , " he said . home grown ? the former head of scotland yard warned on sunday that the london bombers were probably british and that there were many people in the country willing to take part in such atrocities . " the terrorists at the center of the london bombing this week will almost certainly be british born and bred , brought up here and totally aware of british life and values , " sir john stevens wrote in a column for the news of the world tabloid . stevens , who quit his job as britain 's most senior police official early this year , dismissed speculation that the terrorists had come from abroad .
" that 's just dangerous wishful thinking , a damaging illusion , " he wrote .
" i 'm afraid there 's a sufficient number of people in this country willing to be islamic terrorists that they do n't have to be drafted in from abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.07.2005 german police uniforms made in belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ordering from belarus saves the police money human rights activists are complaining that the german government , which restricts diplomatic ties with belarus due to its human rights situation , still buy its police uniforms from europe 's last dictatorship . at a roadside spot-check in the german state of hesse , the police officers are stopping cars to see if they 're roadworthy .
they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

the bombs were planted by french agents , in response to greenpeace 's protests against the french nuclear testing program in the pacific . french president francois mitterand gave the go-ahead for the attack , le monde newspaper in france reported saturday , quoting from a document written by then secret service -lrb- dgse -rrb- chief admiral pierre lacoste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois mitterrand " i asked the president if he would authorize me to conduct the project of neutralisation that i had studied at the request of -lrb- defense minister charles -rrb- hernu .
he gave me his consent while emphasizing the importance he placed on the nuclear tests , " wrote lacoste , then head of the general directorate for external security -lrb- dgse -rrb- .
" i then went into great detail on the project , the authorization was sufficiently explicit . " earlier on may 6 , 1985 , lacoste had met with hernu to outline the plan to sabotage the greenpeace ship .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .

he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .

" but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.07.2005 german police uniforms made in belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ordering from belarus saves the police money human rights activists are complaining that the german government , which restricts diplomatic ties with belarus due to its human rights situation , still buy its police uniforms from europe 's last dictatorship . at a roadside spot-check in the german state of hesse , the police officers are stopping cars to see if they 're roadworthy .
they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

the bombs were planted by french agents , in response to greenpeace 's protests against the french nuclear testing program in the pacific . french president francois mitterand gave the go-ahead for the attack , le monde newspaper in france reported saturday , quoting from a document written by then secret service -lrb- dgse -rrb- chief admiral pierre lacoste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois mitterrand " i asked the president if he would authorize me to conduct the project of neutralisation that i had studied at the request of -lrb- defense minister charles -rrb- hernu .
he gave me his consent while emphasizing the importance he placed on the nuclear tests , " wrote lacoste , then head of the general directorate for external security -lrb- dgse -rrb- .
" i then went into great detail on the project , the authorization was sufficiently explicit . " earlier on may 6 , 1985 , lacoste had met with hernu to outline the plan to sabotage the greenpeace ship .
" far from being shocked by the idea of sabotage in the dock at auckland , " wrote the admiral " he made light of my reservations and encouraged me in that direction , repeating that it was an issue essential to defence policy . " " they -lrb- greenpeace -rrb- want to make war with us , we are at war , we must n't have scruples on such vital subjects , i take full responsibility , " the admiral quoted hernu as saying . silent tribute the demonstrators in paris , wearing the rainbow colors of the organization , had come from about 15 countries and sat or knelt in silence on the esplanade of the trocadero , across the river seine from the eiffel tower , to form the symbol and mark the event . " we want to send a message of hope and an appeal for peace , " yannick jadot , campaigns director for greenpeace france , said .
he called on " international leaders immediately to stop wasting astronomical sums on developing their atomic bombs " and devote instead " their resources to an action programme to promote peace , combat climate change , preserve forests and save the oceans .

the bombs were planted by french agents , in response to greenpeace 's protests against the french nuclear testing program in the pacific . french president francois mitterand gave the go-ahead for the attack , le monde newspaper in france reported saturday , quoting from a document written by then secret service -lrb- dgse -rrb- chief admiral pierre lacoste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois mitterrand " i asked the president if he would authorize me to conduct the project of neutralisation that i had studied at the request of -lrb- defense minister charles -rrb- hernu .
he gave me his consent while emphasizing the importance he placed on the nuclear tests , " wrote lacoste , then head of the general directorate for external security -lrb- dgse -rrb- .
" i then went into great detail on the project , the authorization was sufficiently explicit . " earlier on may 6 , 1985 , lacoste had met with hernu to outline the plan to sabotage the greenpeace ship .
" far from being shocked by the idea of sabotage in the dock at auckland , " wrote the admiral " he made light of my reservations and encouraged me in that direction , repeating that it was an issue essential to defence policy . " " they -lrb- greenpeace -rrb- want to make war with us , we are at war , we must n't have scruples on such vital subjects , i take full responsibility , " the admiral quoted hernu as saying . silent tribute the demonstrators in paris , wearing the rainbow colors of the organization , had come from about 15 countries and sat or knelt in silence on the esplanade of the trocadero , across the river seine from the eiffel tower , to form the symbol and mark the event . " we want to send a message of hope and an appeal for peace , " yannick jadot , campaigns director for greenpeace france , said .
he called on " international leaders immediately to stop wasting astronomical sums on developing their atomic bombs " and devote instead " their resources to an action programme to promote peace , combat climate change , preserve forests and save the oceans .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .

the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .

" but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

the idea to build a road that would connect valleys in the alpine region between lake constance and berchtesgaden came from a german doctor in 1927 .
the route became a project of national importance during the nazi era , employing at one time over 25,000 workers , but the war put a stop to the development .
the project was relaunched in the 1950s , and the 450 km-long -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- route was finalized in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passion for puncuality : a historic building in rothenburg has no less than three clocks foreign tourists are particularly drawn to the romantische strasse -lrb- romantic road -rrb- which connects more than two dozen southern german attractions , including the baroque city of würzburg , the castle of the teutonic order at bad mergentheim and king ludwig 's fantasy-come-true , the famous neuschwanstein castle . other popular destinations include the märchenstrasse -lrb- fairytale route -rrb- or the burgenstrasse -lrb- castle road -rrb- .
some routes are situated in particular geographic areas , others start off in the high north and lead all the way to the south .
one such long route is the allee route -lrb- alleestrasse -rrb- , which runs from rügen island to lake constance . culinary delights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : föhr island is part of the cheese road numerous hotels and inns are located along these routes so that travelers can make their discoveries by car or by bike , on their own pace .
restaurants offer regional specialties ranging from zesty veal sausage in the south to freshly made fish dishes in the north .
some scenic routes are even built around the idea of satisfying the traveler 's hedonistic urges , like the käsestrasse -lrb- cheese route -rrb- in schleswig-holstein or the ahr-rotweinstrasse -lrb- ahr red wine route -rrb- in rhineland-palatinate . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hansel and gretel join global hall of fame the un 's cultural organization , unesco , has accepted the brothers grimm fairy tales from germany to join its memory of the world list .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.07.2005 german police uniforms made in belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ordering from belarus saves the police money human rights activists are complaining that the german government , which restricts diplomatic ties with belarus due to its human rights situation , still buy its police uniforms from europe 's last dictatorship . at a roadside spot-check in the german state of hesse , the police officers are stopping cars to see if they 're roadworthy .
they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

the idea to build a road that would connect valleys in the alpine region between lake constance and berchtesgaden came from a german doctor in 1927 .
the route became a project of national importance during the nazi era , employing at one time over 25,000 workers , but the war put a stop to the development .
the project was relaunched in the 1950s , and the 450 km-long -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- route was finalized in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german passion for puncuality : a historic building in rothenburg has no less than three clocks foreign tourists are particularly drawn to the romantische strasse -lrb- romantic road -rrb- which connects more than two dozen southern german attractions , including the baroque city of würzburg , the castle of the teutonic order at bad mergentheim and king ludwig 's fantasy-come-true , the famous neuschwanstein castle . other popular destinations include the märchenstrasse -lrb- fairytale route -rrb- or the burgenstrasse -lrb- castle road -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.07.2005 german police uniforms made in belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ordering from belarus saves the police money human rights activists are complaining that the german government , which restricts diplomatic ties with belarus due to its human rights situation , still buy its police uniforms from europe 's last dictatorship . at a roadside spot-check in the german state of hesse , the police officers are stopping cars to see if they 're roadworthy .
they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

the bombs were planted by french agents , in response to greenpeace 's protests against the french nuclear testing program in the pacific . french president francois mitterand gave the go-ahead for the attack , le monde newspaper in france reported saturday , quoting from a document written by then secret service -lrb- dgse -rrb- chief admiral pierre lacoste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois mitterrand " i asked the president if he would authorize me to conduct the project of neutralisation that i had studied at the request of -lrb- defense minister charles -rrb- hernu .
he gave me his consent while emphasizing the importance he placed on the nuclear tests , " wrote lacoste , then head of the general directorate for external security -lrb- dgse -rrb- .
" i then went into great detail on the project , the authorization was sufficiently explicit . " earlier on may 6 , 1985 , lacoste had met with hernu to outline the plan to sabotage the greenpeace ship .
" far from being shocked by the idea of sabotage in the dock at auckland , " wrote the admiral " he made light of my reservations and encouraged me in that direction , repeating that it was an issue essential to defence policy . " " they -lrb- greenpeace -rrb- want to make war with us , we are at war , we must n't have scruples on such vital subjects , i take full responsibility , " the admiral quoted hernu as saying . silent tribute the demonstrators in paris , wearing the rainbow colors of the organization , had come from about 15 countries and sat or knelt in silence on the esplanade of the trocadero , across the river seine from the eiffel tower , to form the symbol and mark the event . " we want to send a message of hope and an appeal for peace , " yannick jadot , campaigns director for greenpeace france , said .
he called on " international leaders immediately to stop wasting astronomical sums on developing their atomic bombs " and devote instead " their resources to an action programme to promote peace , combat climate change , preserve forests and save the oceans . " in new zealand members of the original crew gathered to pay tribute to their colleague who died in the explosions and to appeal for world peace . the original skipper pete willcox dived 25 meters to where the wreck of the boat now lies and placed a memorial sculpture on the bridge , while above pereira 's daughter marelle cast flowers into the water . in paris a ship 's bell tolled twice , at the moment the two mines placed in the boat exploded .
demonstrators then transformed their peace symbol into a rainbow , displaying a banner proclaiming : " you ca n't sink a rainbow .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .

" but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .

they 're fulfilling their duty to keep law and order , but human right activists complain that their uniforms come from a country where democracy and the rule of law have no place . that 's because europe 's last dictatorship supplies uniforms for german police officers .
their shirts have been made in the textile factories of belarus for the past ten years .
production head olga trusjevitsch proudly says they are working on a commission from lower saxony for several thousand shirts right now .
the order will be ready in a week . more than a thousand women work in this garment factory in dzerzhinsk , from early morning to late at night .
they earn 120 euros a month and make shirts that cost german police officers an average of nine euros each - an unbeatable price .
but human rights activists find these business dealings with alexander lukashenko 's dictatorship infuriating . " the state of human rights in belarus has been extremely bad for a very long time , " said christa nickels who heads the german parliament 's human rights committee .
" in march , the european parliament established again that human rights are trampled on there , that lukashenko controls the economy , that both non-governmental organizations and the political opposition are bullied , harassed and their members arrested without cause .
it 's really desolate . " business benefiting a dictator ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a terrible record of human rights : democracy activists in march beaten that does n't seem to bother the customers in germany .
the factory management says the police in all 16 german states , as well as customs and border guards and even the german army , the bundeswehr , order shirts sewn in belarus . such orders benefit alexander lukashenko as well .
he has complete control over the economy and the country .
the bundeswehr , customs authorities and police know that , of course - but cheap uniforms are more important .
the parliament of belarus does n't deserve the name .
opponents incur lukashenko 's wrath - like a police general the dictator is punishing at the moment . in dzerzhinsk , where the shirts are sewn , there 's an atmosphere of fear .
the city is named after felix dzerzhinsky , who founded the bolshevist secret police - a role model for lukashenko . fear reigns in the factory as well .
people here say they could do much more business if belarus were n't ruled by a dictator like alexander lukashenko .
the factory director says so as well . " it does interfere with business , " said vassily romanov of the eliz garment factory .
" we could attract all sorts of other orders to our country if the situation were different from what it is now . " but then he stops talking , and cuts short the interview . no one takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko tolerates no dissent the german police , customs and army purchase the shirts .
what do the customs authorities have to say about these dubious dealings ?
the german finance ministry is responsible for customs administration .
it says setting restrictions would violate the terms of allocation of funding .
the german defense ministry , prefers not to address the matter . for nickels , it 's completely contradictory for germany to freeze political relations with belarus and buy uniforms from it at the same time . " i would strongly advise and urge that the german states check to what extent they can freeze contracts until there 's an improvement in human rights - and of course to make clear to this dictator that these orders will be lost if the state of human rights is not drastically improved , " said nickels . sanctions rarely used martin knapp from the german chamber of industry and commerce says such measures would put the two countries ' good economic relations at risk .
he points to the fact that many large german corporations operate in belarus , and says many of them could get into difficulties . " of course , the world of international politics does have sanctions and trade embargoes as tools , " he said .
" but as usually , international institutions such as the eu and the united nations use these instruments very sparingly . " one of the priorities of the belarus embassy in berlin is to attract foreign investors to the country and belarus ambassador vladimir skvorzov strongly opposes economic sanctions . " i 'm against any form of sanctions , no matter in what area , " he said . " bans have never accomplished anything .
if we really were to go in that direction , germany would sustain substantial losses as well . " he also indirectly pointed out that any such measures would likely have little effect on lukashenko : " it would hit the people who work in the factories the hardest .

"
but scott-lee would not elaborate on the nature of the alarm . he put the threat in the context of the broader global climate on terrorism , saying it was unrelated to the suspicious packages which were found and turned out to be harmless .
" it was not a false threat .
it was a serious threat .
the intelligence indicated that the people of birmingham were in danger last night .
and we responded to make sure that the people were taken out of the danger area , " he said . police had lifted the cordon on incoming traffic to the inner ring road of britain 's second-city but confirmed searches were ongoing .
they said the threat was probably not connected to thursday 's bomb attacks in the british capital and that the decision to close a large part birmingham and evacuate an estimated 20,000 people had not been taken lightly . police searched bars , restaurants and clubs in an area known as the golden mile , frisking patrons as they came and went . london death toll britain 's interior minister , charles clarke , said on sunday that he expected the death toll from the london bomb attacks to rise and that he was optimistic the perpetrators eventually would be caught .
however , he said he feared more attacks if they remained at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we think it 's likely to be more than 50 " people killed , home secretary clarke told bbc television .
several dead have yet to be recovered as crews work to clear the wreckage of some underground train carriages .
more than 20 people are still missing . police said on saturday that they had made no arrests and had yet to focus on any particular suspect .
" i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " clarke said .
" i am very optimistic indeed .
i think the track record of our security services in bringing people to justice is good . " but he said he feared the possibility of further attacks if the bombers remained at large .
" that is why the number one priority has to be the catching of the perpetrators , " he said . home grown ? the former head of scotland yard warned on sunday that the london bombers were probably british and that there were many people in the country willing to take part in such atrocities . " the terrorists at the center of the london bombing this week will almost certainly be british born and bred , brought up here and totally aware of british life and values , " sir john stevens wrote in a column for the news of the world tabloid . stevens , who quit his job as britain 's most senior police official early this year , dismissed speculation that the terrorists had come from abroad .
" that 's just dangerous wishful thinking , a damaging illusion , " he wrote .
" i 'm afraid there 's a sufficient number of people in this country willing to be islamic terrorists that they do n't have to be drafted in from abroad .

work has started to demolish pebble mill but for the architect who designed them their destruction signals a " disastrous move " for the future of birmingham .
john madin designed numerous buildings for birmingham including the central library and the chamber of commerce building which gained him an award from the royal institute of british architects .
birmingham city planners are currently mulling over proposals to replace the library and demolish the chamber of commerce .
' demolished arbitrarily ' while many will be glad to see these buildings go mr madin said it showed a lack of " competent planning " on the part of birmingham council chiefs .
he added : " there seems to be no comprehensive plan as to how the city should evolve over the years , " he said .
" buildings are being demolished arbitrarily just to fulfil the demand of the commercial organisation . "
work has started on the demolition of pebble mill which will make way for a £ 100m science and technology park .
it is astonishing that rather than recognise the quality of this building -lrb- central library -rrb- birmingham is instead planning to erase it .
twentieth century society mr madin studied radio and television studios in the uk and abroad examining programme production for nine months before designing pebble mill .
in its day it was said to be the first in the world to integrate sound and television under one roof .
but after 40 years serving as the base for the midlands , bbc birmingham moved to new premises at the mailbox in the city centre .
the council want to build a new library in digbeth another of john madin 's buildings under threat is birmingham 's central library after birmingham city council proposed to relocate it to a new building in digbeth .
officially opened in 1975 the original plan for the library was as a complete cultural centre with exhibition areas , a lecture hall , children 's and music departments , a drama centre and athletic institute covering the whole of paradise circus .
halfway through the project the council sold part of the land off for a hotel and commercial developments and instead of a formal entrance to the library , as first planned , there now stands fast food outlets and bars .
one man 's architectural triumph is another man 's lump of concrete freddie gick , birmingham civic society but despite the half-finished design the twentieth century society , set up to safeguard the heritage of architecture and design in britain , said the library was an " excellent building " and was one of the " twentieth century 's architectural masterpieces .
" it is astonishing that rather than recognise the quality of this building birmingham is instead planning to erase it . " a society spokeswoman added .
but freddie gick , from the birmingham civic society which aims to ensure high standards in planning , building and preservation , said opinions and tastes differed .
" one man 's architectural triumph is another man 's lump of concrete .
" the john maden library is well regarded by some and seen by others as an unattractive block that stands in the way of a massive development opportunity for the paradise circus site . "
the new chamber of commerce building will open in 2007 a spokeswoman from birmingham city council said there were a number of options up for consideration which were due to be discussed at the next cabinet meeting and no comment was being made until then .
mr madin 's prized building , which has provided a base for birmingham 's chamber of commerce for the last 45 years , is to be demolished and replaced with a bigger building on the same site .
describing the current building as " tired " and " outdated " a spokesman for the birmingham chamber of commerce said the new £ 80m headquarters will be three buildings with an 850-space car park and is due to be completed in 2007 .
mr madin , now aged 82 and currently working on a new village development in wales , has been described as birmingham 's most important post-war architect shaping the modern face of the city .
born in moseley he was also responsible for designing telford , shropshire , the offices for the birmingham post & mail and redeveloping the calthorpe estate in edgbaston .
despite abandoning his " brummie " roots and moving out of the city in the 70s to pursue other projects around the world mr madin is still passionate about the future of the city .
" birmingham is still my city and i feel responsible for it . "
